teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure our major manufacturing operations are located in the czech republic malaysia mexico and the united states the us 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 

• development of new products and product line extensions 

• investment in new technologies and broadening the application of our existing technologies 

• expansion of the use of our products in existing markets and introduction of our products into new geographic markets 

• achievement of economies of scale as we continue to expand by utilizing our direct sales force and distribution network to sell new products as well as by increasing efficiencies in our sales and marketing organizations research and development activities and manufacturing and distribution facilities and 

• expansion of our product portfolio through select acquisitions licensing arrangements and business partnerships that enhance expand or expedite our development initiatives or our ability to increase our market share 

our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to bring to market cost effective innovative products that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications as well as developing enhancements to and product line extensions of existing products during 2021 we introduced several product line extensions and five new products our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of class i and class ii medical devices most of which require 510k clearance by the us food and drug administration fda for sale in the us and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510k clearance we believe that seeking 510k clearance or qualifying for 510kexempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii medical devices see government regulation below for additional information 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements

our markets 

we generally serve three endmarkets hospitals and healthcare providers medical device manufacturers and home care these markets are affected by a number of factors including demographics utilization and reimbursement patterns the following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 derived from each of our end markets 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the us relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the us 

all of our medical devices manufactured or distributed in the us are subject to requirements set forth by the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” and regulations promulgated by the fda under the fdc act which are enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging labeling storage installation servicing marketing importing and exporting of all finished devices intended for human use additional fda requirements include premarket clearance and approval advertising and promotion distribution and postmarket surveillance of our medical devices and establishment of registration and device listing for our facilities 

unless an exemption preamendment grandfather status that is medical devices legally marketed in the us before may 28 1976 or fda enforcement discretion applies each medical device that we market in the us must first receive either clearance as a class i or typically a class ii device after submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval as a class iii device after filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate to the fda that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device a 510kcleared device a preamendment device for which fda has not called for pmas or a device with a de novo authorization referred to as the predicate device substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process requires regulatory competence to execute and usually takes four to nine months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed by the fda through the de novo process the process for granting marketing authorization when no substantially equivalent device exists if the fda agrees it is a low to moderate risk device a device that is not exempt from premarket review and is not eligible for 510k clearance or de novo authorization is categorized as class iii and must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval also requires specific regulatory competence and is more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k or de novo 

processes the pma process generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i 510k exempt and class ii devices that require 510k clearance although a few are 510kexempt in addition certain modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k clearance or a de novo authorization the sponsor of a clinical trial must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s requirements for investigational device exemptions “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board irb which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve require modifications to or disapprove research to protect the rights safety and welfare of human research subjects the fda may order the temporary or permanent hold or discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects an irb may also require the clinical trial to be halted at a given clinical trial site for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or to adequately ensure the protection of human subjects or may impose other conditions conducting medical device clinical trials is a complex and costly activity and frequently requires the use of outsourced resources that specialize in planning conducting andor monitoring the clinical trial for the medical device manufacturer 

a device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements those regulatory requirements include but are not limited to the following 

• device listing and establishment registration 

• adherence to the quality system regulation “qsr” which requires stringent design testing control documentation complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures 

• labeling including advertising and promotion requirements 

• prohibitions against the promotion of offlabel uses or indications 

• adverse event and malfunction reporting medical device reports or mdrs 

• postapproval restrictions or conditions potentially including postapproval clinical trials or other required testing 

• postmarket surveillance requirements 

• the fda’s recall authority whereby it can require or request the recall of products from the market and 

• reporting and documentation of voluntary corrections or removals 

the fda has issued final regulations regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which requires manufacturers to label or mark certain medical devices andor their packaging with unique identifiers although the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it has required us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements having taken effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2022 

certain of our medical devices are sold in kits that include a drug component such as lidocaine these types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the center for devices and radiological health cdrh under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices “cgmps” and adverse drug experience reporting requirements to the extent applicable to the drugcomponent repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cgmps as well as other regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections by fda personnel to verify compliance with the qsr 21 cfr part 820 as well as other regulatory requirements similar inspections and audits are performed by notified bodies to verify compliance to applicable iso standards eg iso 134852016 by auditing organizations under the medical device single audit program 

mdsap applicable to regulatory requirements of australia brazil canada japan and the us andor by regulatory authorities to verify compliance with medical device regulations and requirements from the countries in which we distribute product if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority under certain circumstances to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

regulation of medical devices outside of the us 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the us in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems manufacturing certification requirements and audits through the mdsap program or other regulatory authority inspections also apply in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices as compared to the predecessor medical device directive the eu mdd including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems economic operators and postmarket surveillance the eu mdr went into effect in may 2021 as of the effective date new and modified devices must be certified under and be compliant with the eu mdr devices that previously satisfied eu mdd requirements can continue to be marketed in the eu subject to certain limitations until the expiration of their current eu mdd certifications which may be no later than may 2024 failure to obtain eu mdr certifications prior to the expiration of existing eu mdd certifications may limit our ability to sell certain products in the eu until eu mdr certification is obtained additionally certain eu mdr requirements will go into effect for all devices in may 2024 failure to meet the applicable eu mdr requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the us targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the us that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

in addition we are subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members effective january 2022 we are also required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives the reported data is available to the public on the cms website failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” imposed regulatory mandates and other measures designed to contain the cost of healthcare in addition to annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device 

manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals violations of these laws are punishable by a range of fines penalties and other sanctions 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the us that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the us are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the us we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the us government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees distributors or other agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods based upon the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex name and the arrow and urolift brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture and sterilization of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used the components supplied and the sterilization services provided for our overall operations most of the materials components and sterilization services we utilize are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers however our ability to establish alternate sources of supply of materials and sterilization services may be delayed due to fda and other regulatory authority requirements 

regarding the manufacture and sterilization of our products volatility in commodity prices and freight costs can have a significant impact on the cost of producing and supplying certain of our products 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide innovative new safe and effective products that enhance clinical value by reducing infections improving patient and clinician safety enhancing patient outcomes and enabling less invasive procedures 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns and to a lesser extent the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products historically we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or stock price the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

risks relating to our business and operations 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products due to among other things our inability to 

• identify viable new products 

• maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our investments in research and development and product acquisitions 

• obtain adequate intellectual property protection 

• gain market acceptance of new products or 

• successfully obtain regulatory approvals 

in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by public health epidemics including the ongoing covid19 global health pandemic 

we are subject to risks associated with public health threats including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and has negatively impacted our operations financial performance and cash flows because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict the pandemic’s impact on our operations and financial performance as well as its impact on our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives successfully remains uncertain and difficult to predict further the ultimate 

impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions on travel transport and workforce pressures and deferrals or postponements of elective procedures the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies travel and economic activity the availability of federal state local or nonus funding programs general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the timing and pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides which could be impacted by a number of factors including limited provider capacity to perform procedures using our products that were deferred as a result of the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected and is expected to continue to subject our operations financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

• it has resulted and we expect it will continue to result in lower revenues in certain of our product categories including our interventional urology which revenues are primarily concentrated in our americas segment surgical interventional anesthesia and oem product categories in which we sell products largely utilized in elective procedures which have been significantly reduced or suspended due to the pandemic 

• it has resulted in higher revenues in our respiratory and vascular access product categories however we are unable to predict how long this increased demand will last or how significant it will be 

• it has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products we rely on our major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic malaysia mexico and the us to manufacture our products the covid19 pandemic andor the governmental or regulatory actions taken in response to covid19 pandemic may interfere with our ability or that of our employees or suppliers to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business and create a risk to our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or at all we have experienced and expect to continue to experience inefficiencies in our manufacturing operations due to governmentmandated and selfimposed restrictions placed on facilities in certain locations primarily in north america and asia additionally we have experienced and continue to experience a higher than normal level of absenteeism across our global manufacturing sites in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical device products we may elect to or the government may require us to allocate manufacturing capacity for example pursuant to the us defense production act in a way that adversely affects our regular operations and financial results results in differential treatment of customers andor adversely affects our customer relationships and reputation 

• while we have not experienced significant payment defaults by or identified other significant collectability concerns with our customers to date we may be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivables if our customers experience financial difficulties or are unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to pay for our products on a timely basis if at all 

• the covid19 pandemic including related illness border closures travel restrictions quarantines lockdowns or other workforce disruptions has generally had an adverse effect on macroeconomic conditions across the globe accordingly this has impacted various aspects of our global supply chain including causing logistical transport challenges for our freight transport providers and has resulted in cost inflation while we have not yet experienced significant disruptions in the global supply chain for our products that are in high demand we have in some cases experienced lengthened delivery times resulting in backorders for some of our products these disruptions or our failure to respond to them could increase manufacturing or distribution costs or cause further delays in delivering or an inability to deliver products to our customers 

• the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and volatility is likely to continue we might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase 

• as a us federal government contractor we are subject to a federal executive order requiring our us employees to be vaccinated unless they qualify for medical or religious exemptions the order has been challenged in court and its ultimate status and impact on our business is uncertain however this requirement or other future vaccine mandates could adversely affect our workforce retention and hiring which may adversely affect our business and results of operations including through the disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations 

these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic or other pandemics or epidemics could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein we might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near or longterm adverse impacts to our results however these effects could have an 

adverse impact on our liquidity capital resources operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely and such impact could be material 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly in some countries medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected in this regard we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations including reductions in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by discouraging customers’ selection of and reducing the prices they are willing to pay for our products 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors have implemented and are continuing to implement cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern among other things the development design clinical testing premarket clearance and approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change 

in the us before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k clearance or de novo authorization or approval of a premarket approval application or pma from the fda similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the us also require clearance approval authorization or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed in the eu the eu mdr went into effect in may 2021 and includes significant additional pre and postmarket requirements the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign government authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application or the fda or a foreign government authority may change the classification of a product which could require additional clinical studies and new marketing submissions 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 

• partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing 

• product shortages 

• delays in product manufacturing 

• warning or untitled letters 

• fines or civil penalties 

• delays in or restrictions on obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals 

• withdrawal or suspension of required clearances approvals or licenses 

• product seizures or recalls 

• injunctions 

• criminal prosecution 

• advisories or other field actions 

• operating restrictions and 

• prohibitions against exporting of products to or importing products from countries outside the us 

we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from certain regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated promoting a device for a use outside of the cleared or approved intended use or population that is an offlabel use or making false misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation qsr which requires among other things periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation in addition any facilities assembling kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and requires the reporting of certain recalls or other field safety corrective actions for medical devices issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

• the federal healthcare antikickback statute which among other things prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration one purpose of which is to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase order or recommendation of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid or soliciting payment for such referrals purchases orders and recommendations 

• federal false claims laws which among other things prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government including medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors 

• the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” which prohibits schemes to defraud any healthcare benefit program and false statements relating to healthcare matters and 

• state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws such as antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers 

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our 

operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the affordable care act imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals effective january 2021 we are required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists including anesthesiology assistants and certified nursemidwives the reported information is made publicly available in a searchable format in addition device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

there are also certain states including connecticut massachusetts and vermont that require device manufacturers to track and report payments or transfers of value provided to certain health care providers and health care entities in addition some states such as california connecticut nevada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including facility consolidations organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce and we may engage in similar efforts in the future while we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning or erp systems to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives however as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

disruptions in sterilization of our products or regulatory initiatives further restricting the use of ethylene oxide in sterilization facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products require sterilization prior to sale a common method for sterilizing medical products involves the use of ethylene oxide which is listed as a hazardous air pollutant under the clean air act as amended and emissions of which are regulated by the us environmental protection agency epa and other regulatory authorities one of our contract sterilizers sterigenics us llc uses ethylene oxide in its sterilization process including at its facilities in smyrna cobb county georgia and santa teresa new mexico which have sterilized some of our vascular surgical intermittent catheter and oem products during the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31 2019 operations at the smyrna facility were suspended by state and local officials due to issues 

associated with the facilitys use of ethylene oxide in its sterilization operations but have since reopened in december 2020 the new mexico attorney general initiated legal proceedings involving the santa teresa facility alleging that its operations have resulted in impermissible ethylene oxide emissions while both plants are currently operating normally should their operations be suspended or adversely affected our ability to provide affected products to our customers could be impaired if we are unable to utilize alternate facilities and sources for sterilization services 

in addition on october 10 2019 the attorneys general of 15 states and the district of columbia sent a letter to the epa urging that the epa promptly propose and finalize stricter standards for ethylene oxide emissions among other things the attorneys general stated that the current epa standard for ethylene oxide fails to adequately protect workers and communities and that the use of ethylene oxide particularly in the medical device sterilization industry must be reduced on december 12 2019 the epa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit information and request comments that will aid in the epa’s future revisions of the regulations concerning ethylene oxide omissions subsequently on september 13 2021 the epa issued an information collection request to commercial sterilization facilities to gather additional information and data about ethylene oxide sterilization processes and emissions the epa has indicated it expects to issue a proposed rule in 2022 any additional regulatory restrictions on the emission of ethylene oxide by sterilization facilities might impair our ability to provide sufficient quantities of sterilized products to our customers and compel us to seek sterilization alternatives that do not entail the use of ethylene oxide we cannot assure that we would be able to identify such alternatives in the event we were to experience any disruptions in our ability to sterilize our products whether due to capacity constraints or regulatory or other impediments including among other things regulatory initiatives directed generally to sterilization facilities that utilize ethylene oxide or we are unable to transition to alternative facilities in a timely or cost effective manner in the event one or more of the facilities we use is affected we could experience a material adverse impact with respect to our results of operations and financial condition 

a significant portion of our us revenues is derived from sales to distributors and “destocking” activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues in the us is derived from sales to distributors which in turn sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions from time to time these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products a practice we refer to as “destocking” a distributors decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product distributor buying decisions including decisions to purchase competing products changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels economic conditions and other factors following such instances of reduced purchases distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels nevertheless we cannot assure that distributors will in fact increase purchases of our products in this manner a decline in the level of product purchases by our us distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims as well as product recalls any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks related to the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the related legal defense costs may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily conduct or be required by regulatory authorities to conduct a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could harm our reputation decrease demand for our products lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future product 

liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred several years ago led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending resulting in reductions delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors the continuation in a number of markets of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns moreover the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development marketing and other resources as well as significantly greater investments than we anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance as well as the shortterm effects of increased costs on results of operations although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with certain of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay on a quarterly basis we reassess these obligations and in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes we record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings which could have a material impact on our results of operations as of december 31 2021 we accrued 98 million of contingent consideration most of which related to our acquisition of zmedica llc zmedica in addition actual payments may differ materially 

from the amount of the contingent liability which could have a material impact on our results of operations cash flows and liquidity for information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities see “critical accounting policies and estimates” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the affordable care act 

• established a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research 

• implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals physicians and other providers to improve the coordination quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models and 

• created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce medicare spending if projected medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in this regard several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the affordable care act were proposed but not adopted in 2017 however us tax legislation adopted in december 2017 and commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tcja eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act and may have other effects moreover on december 14 2018 the us district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid although the court stayed its ruling pending appeal the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act or any court decision regarding the acts validity is uncertain and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on the longerterm viability of the act or on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the us including belgium the czech republic ireland malaysia and mexico in addition a significant portion of our nonus revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors as of december 31 2021 approximately 70 of our fulltime employees were employed in countries outside of the us and approximately 50 of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the us in addition for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 37 38 and 38 respectively of our net revenues based on the teleflex entity generating the sale were derived from operations outside the us 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the us including 

• exchange controls currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values 

• trade protection measures tariffs and other duties especially in light of trade disputes between the us and several foreign countries including china 

• potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements 

• laws and business practices that favor local companies 

• changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and procedures 

• subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that currently are or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations 

• substantial nonus tax liabilities including potentially negative consequences resulting from changes in tax laws 

• restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of nonus earnings 

• differing labor regulations 

• additional us and foreign government controls or regulations 

• the impact of the united kingdoms departure from the european union commonly referred to as brexit 

• public health epidemics 

• difficulties in the protection of intellectual property and 

• unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against american interests 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business similar antibribery laws are in effect in several foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees distributors or other agents in addition we may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire violations of antibribery laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions as well as harm to our reputation 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the us including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in us government contracts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

additionally in connection with the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine the us government has imposed enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in russia and has indicated it will consider imposing additional sanctions and other similar measures in the near future although our sales into russia did not constitute a material portion of our total revenue in 2021 further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business which could adversely affect our business andor our supply chain business partners or customers in the broader region 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates products manufactured in and sold into foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates which we refer to as nonfunctional currencies a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro will affect our us dollarreported revenue and income although we have entered into forward contracts with several major 

financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum and steel increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need in addition our borrowing costs have been adversely affected by recent interest rate increases and could be further affected if interest rates continue to increase any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to delays in product releases product shortages unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors including 

• the intense competition for skilled personnel in our industry 

• fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions 

• changes in our organizational structure 

• our restructuring initiatives 

• competitors’ hiring practices and 

• the effectiveness of our compensation programs 

our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our failure to maintain strong relationships with physicians and other health care professionals could adversely affect us 

we depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and as a result no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous us and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the us we cannot assure that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop knowhow and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business 

we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations and employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and may involve significant legal expenses in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders generate invoices collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise perform business functions our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and in some cases have caused significant harm although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur expenses lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

regulations related to conflict minerals have caused us to incur additional costs and may adversely affect our business 

in 2012 the sec promulgated rules under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and if so whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country in accordance with applicable regulations we have filed conflict minerals reports annually beginning in 2014 as discussed in these reports we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we have undertaken and continue to undertake efforts to identify where such minerals originated we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups due to among other things our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all moreover we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide products that are drc conflict free we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials 

• emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and 

• the health and safety of our employees 

these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 9 of our employees in the us and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain 

covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

risks relating to our financing arrangements 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 19 billion 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures research and development efforts and other general corporate expenditures 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds for general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• restrict us from pursuing business opportunities and 

• place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness 

if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

• refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness 

• sell assets 

• reduce or delay capital expenditures or 

• seek to raise additional capital 

we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities and taking other desirable corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 4625 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 notes and our 425 senior notes due 2028 the 2028 notes and together with the 2027 notes the senior notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries collectively include limitations on our and their ability to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock or otherwise disqualified stock 

• create liens 

• pay dividends make investments or make other restricted payments 

• sell assets 

• merge consolidate sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and 

• enter into transactions with our affiliates 

in addition our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement a breach of any covenants under any one or more of our debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration 

of all of our debt in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

under our crosscurrency swap agreements a meaningful decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 

in 2018 and 2019 we entered into crosscurrency swap agreements with several financial institutions to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate the swap agreements require an exchange of the notional amounts between us and the counterparties upon expiration or earlier termination of the agreements if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has declined from the rate in effect on the execution date we are required to pay the counterparties an amount equal to the excess of the us dollar value over the euro principal amount we and the counterparties have agreed to a net settlement with regard to the exchange of the notional amounts at the date of expiration or earlier termination of the agreements in the event of a significant decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate our payment obligations to the counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows in this regard if at the expiration or earlier termination of our swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has declined by 10 from the rate in effect at the inception of our agreements we would be required to pay approximately 75 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement to the extent we enter into additional crosscurrency swap agreements a decline in the relevant exchange rates could further adversely affect our cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding approximately 469 million shares of our common stock options to purchase 11 million shares of our common stock of which approximately 09 million were vested as of that date restricted stock units covering 02 million shares of our common stock which are expected to vest over the next three years performance stock units covering a maximum of 42272 shares of our common stock which may vest in early 2021 depending on our performance with regard to specified financial measures and market performance of our common stock compared to designated public companies and 3108 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan as of december 31 2021 31 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore our issuance of shares upon the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options as well as the vesting of restricted stock units and some or all of the performance stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and the subsequent sale in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings requirements under covenants in our debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our senior notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 

of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indentures governing the senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us upon an acquisition event that constitutes a “change of control” as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes coupled with a downgrade in the ratings of the senior notes holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash our obligations under the senior notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits improving patient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic 

procedures in critical care and surgical applications approximately 95 of our net revenues come from singleuse medical devices we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies 

we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives based on our evaluation we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position in addition we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship in some instances particularly in asia the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through subdistributors our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel further we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives 

divestiture 

on may 15 2021 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain product lines within our global respiratory product portfolio the divested respiratory business to medline industries inc “medline” for consideration of 2860 million reduced by 12 million in working capital not transferring to medline which is subject to customary post close adjustments the respiratory business divestiture in connection with the respiratory business divestiture we also entered into several ancillary agreements with medline to help facilitate the transfer of the business which provide for transition support quality supply and manufacturing services including a manufacturing and supply transition agreement the msta 

on june 28 2021 the first day of the third quarter of 2021 we completed the initial phase of the respiratory business divestiture pursuant to which we received cash proceeds of 259 million we attributed 338 million of the proceeds to our performance obligations pursuant to the msta the resulting liability was measured as the excess of the estimated fair value of the services to be performed over the estimated proceeds we expect to receive over the msta term it was recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and the related proceeds will be recognized in net revenues as the services are performed 

the second phase of the respiratory business divestiture will occur once we transfer certain additional manufacturing assets to medline our receipt of 150 million in additional cash proceeds is contingent upon the transfer of these manufacturing assets and is expected to occur prior to the end of 2023 we plan to recognize the contingent consideration and any gain on sale resulting from the second phase of the divestiture when it becomes realizable 

net revenues attributable to our divested respiratory business recognized prior to the respiratory business divestiture are included within each of our geographic segments and were 607 million for the year ended december 31 2021 and 1385 million for the year ended december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized 511 million in net revenues attributed to services provided to medline in accordance with the msta which are presented within our americas reporting segment 

covid19 pandemic and related economic factors 

beginning in the first half of 2020 the challenges arising from the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted our financial results mainly as a result of a decline in demand for certain of our products and have had an effect on various aspects of our global operations and employees resulting from precautionary and preventive measures to reduce the spread of covid19 our business has been impacted by travel restrictions border closures and quarantines as they affect our various sites including our manufacturing sites we have also experienced inefficiencies in our manufacturing operations due to temporary or partial work stoppages as well as governmentmandated and selfimposed restrictions placed on and safety measures implemented at our facilities globally the challenges arising from the pandemic have also impacted our contractors suppliers customers and other business partners and have generally had an adverse effect on macroeconomic conditions across the globe accordingly this has impacted various aspects of our global supply chain including causing logistical transport challenges for our freight transport providers and has resulted in cost inflation while we have not yet experienced 

significant disruptions in the global supply chain for our products that are in high demand we have in some cases experienced lengthened delivery times resulting in backorders for some of our products we continue to monitor the impacts resulting from the pandemic on our operations 

to date our financial results were most severely impacted by the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020 due to reduced elective procedure volumes partially offset by increased demand for products used in the treatment of patients with covid19 since the second quarter of 2020 we have experienced varying levels of continuing recovery across our product lines and geographic segments from the challenges stemming from the pandemic we believe that the covid19 pandemic will continue to have an impact on our business particularly in the near term and that such impact would be most significant if the virus becomes more prevalent if vaccine immunization rates do not increase and if new strains of the virus continue to emerge as a result of the dynamic nature of the crisis we cannot accurately predict the extent or duration of the impacts of the pandemic 

in addition to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we continue to monitor trade and tariff activity inflation and exchange rate volatility that could impact our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

results of operations 

as used in this discussion new products are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months and “existing products” are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from any elimination of distributors either through acquisition or termination of the distributor from the sales channel all dollar amounts in tables are presented in millions unless otherwise noted 

for a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2020 and 2019 refer to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed on february 25 2021 

comparison of 2021 and 2020 

revenues 



net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 2724 million or 107compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to a 944 million increase in sales volume of existing products largely stemming from the impact that the covid19 pandemic had on the prior year net revenues of 704 million generated by acquired businesses primarily zmedica a 500 million increase in new product sales and 449 million of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

gross profit 



for the year ended december 31 2021 gross margin increased 300 basis points or 57 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher sales volumes largely stemming from the impact that the covid19 pandemic had on the prior year benefits from cost improvement initiatives price increases and favorable product mix the increases in gross margin were partially offset by an increase in logistics and distribution costs largely stemming from the enduring impact of the covid19 pandemic 

selling general and administrative 



selling general and administrative expenses increased 1165 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to the benefit recognized in the prior year 

resulting from decreases in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities stemming from the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic higher selling and marketing expenses across certain of our product portfolios operating expenses incurred by acquired businesses primarily zmedica and higher performance related employeebenefit expenses 

research and development 



research and development expenses increased 111 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to european union medical device regulation eu mdr related costs partially offset by lower project spend within certain of our product portfolios 

restructuring and impairment charges 

respiratory divestiture plan 

in 2021 in connection with the respiratory business divestiture we committed to a restructuring plan designed to separate the manufacturing operations that will be transferred to medline from those that will remain with teleflex which includes related workforce reductions the “respiratory divestiture plan” the plan includes expanding certain of our existing locations to accommodate the transfer of capacity from the sites that will be transferred to medline and replicating the manufacturing processes at alternate existing locations we expect this plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2023 

we estimate that we will incur aggregate pretax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the respiratory divestiture plan of 24 million to 30 million and substantially all of these charges will result in cash outlays the majority of which will be made in 2022 and 2023 additionally we expect to incur 22 million to 28 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan which we expect will be incurred mostly in 2022 and 2023 

2021 restructuring plan 

during the first quarter of 2021 we committed to a restructuring plan designed to streamline various business functions across our segments the 2021 restructuring plan the plan was substantially completed by the end of 2021 and we expect future restructuring charges associated with the program if any to be nominal we will achieve annual pretax savings of 15 million as a result of this plan 

anticipated charges and pretax savings related to restructuring programs and other similar cost savings initiatives 

we have ongoing restructuring programs consisting of the consolidation of our manufacturing operations referred to as our 2019 2018 and 2014 footprint realignment plans in addition to the respiratory divestiture plan and the 2021 restructuring plan both as described above we also have similar ongoing activities to relocate certain manufacturing operations within our oem segment the oem initiative that do not meet the criteria for a restructuring program under applicable accounting guidance nevertheless the activities should result in cost savings we expect only minimal costs to be incurred in connection with the oem initiative with respect to the restructuring programs and the oem initiative the table below summarizes charges incurred or estimated to be incurred and estimated annual pretax savings to be realized as follows 1 with respect to charges a the estimated total charges that will have been incurred once the restructuring programs and the oem initiative are completed b the charges incurred through december 31 2021 and c the estimated charges to be incurred from january 1 2022 through the last anticipated completion date of the restructuring programs and the oem initiative and 2 with respect to estimated annual pretax savings a the estimated total annual pretax savings to be realized once the restructuring programs and oem initiative are completed b the estimated annual pretax savings realized based on the progress of the restructuring programs and the oem initiative through december 31 2021 and c the estimated additional annual pretax savings to be realized from january 1 2022 through the last anticipated completion date of the restructuring programs and the oem initiative 

estimated charges and pretax savings are subject to change based on among other things the nature and timing of restructuring activities and similar activities changes in the scope of restructuring programs and the oem initiative unanticipated expenditures and other developments the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions 

and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pretax savings moreover estimated pretax savings constituting efficiencies with respect to increased costs that otherwise would have resulted from business acquisitions involve among other things assumptions regarding the cost structure and integration of businesses that previously were not administered by our management which are subject to a particularly high degree of risk and uncertainty it is likely that estimates of charges and pretax savings will change from time to time and the table below may reflect changes from amounts previously estimated additional details including estimated charges expected to be incurred in connection with our restructuring programs and the anticipated completion dates are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

pretax savings may be realized during and subsequent to the completion of the restructuring programs pretax savings can also be affected by increases or decreases in sales volumes generated by the businesses impacted by the consolidation of manufacturing operations such variations in revenues can increase or decrease pretax savings generated by the consolidation of manufacturing operations for example an increase in sales volumes generated by the impacted businesses although likely to increase manufacturing costs may generate additional savings with respect to costs that otherwise would have been incurred if the manufacturing operations were not consolidated 



1 restructuring plans consist of the 2021 restructuring program and the 2019 2018 and 2014 footprint realignment plans 

2 represents charges that are directly related to restructuring programs and principally constitute costs to transfer manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations project management costs and accelerated depreciation as well as a charge that is expected to be imposed by a taxing authority as a result of our exit from facilities in the authoritys jurisdiction most of these charges other than the tax charge are expected to be recognized as cost of goods sold 

3 the majority of the pretax savings are expected to result in reductions to cost of goods sold substantially all of the estimated remaining savings are expected to be realized between january 1 2022 and december 31 2023 

the following discussion provides additional details with respect to our ongoing significant restructuring programs 

2019 footprint realignment plan 

in february 2019 we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations and related workforce reductions the “2019 footprint realignment plan these actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2022 

we estimate that we will incur charges totaling 54 million to 60 million under the plan of which we estimate that 48 million to 54 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays we expect to incur 31 million to 33 million in total capital expenditures under the plan 

we expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 20 million to 22 million once the plan is fully implemented 

2018 footprint realignment plan 

in may 2018 we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain european manufacturing 

operations to existing lowercost locations the outsourcing of certain european distribution operations and related workforce reductions the 2018 footprint realignment plan these actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2022 

we estimate that we will incur total charges in connection with the 2018 footprint realignment plan of 110 million to 128 million of which we estimate that 99 million to 122 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays additionally we expect to incur 15 million to 16 million in total capital expenditures under the plan 

we expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 25 million to 30 million once the plan is fully implemented 

2014 footprint realignment plan 

in april 2014 we initiated a restructuring plan involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain highercost locations to existing lowercost locations the 2014 footprint realignment plan we expect the plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2022 

we estimate that we will incur total charges of 53 million to 55 million which we expect will result in cash outlays of 43 million to 46 million and total capital expenditures of 26 million to 27 million under the plan 

we expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 28 million to 30 million once the plan is fully implemented 

the following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our restructuring programs as well as impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits 



1 during the second quarter of 2020 we committed to a workforce reduction designed to improve profitability and reduce cost primarily by streamlining certain sales and marketing functions in our emea segment and certain manufacturing operations in our oem segment the 2020 workforce reduction plan the plan was substantially completed at the end of 2020 

2 for the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded impairment charges of 67 million related to our decision to abandon intellectual property and other assets primarily associated with our respiratory product portfolio that was not transferred to medline as part of the respiratory business divestiture for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded impairment charges of 214 million related to our decision to abandon certain intellectual property and other assets associated with our surgical product portfolio 

interest expense   



the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the redemption of the 4875 senior notes due 2026 the “2026 notes” resulting in a lower average interest rate and lower average debt outstanding after subsequent debt pay downs using proceeds from the respiratory business divestiture and operating cash flows 

gain on sale of business and assets 



during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized a gain related to the respiratory business divestiture 

loss on extinguishment of debt   



during the year ended december 31 2021 we prepaid the 400 million aggregate outstanding principal amount under our 4875 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes in addition to the prepayment of principal we paid to the holders of the 2026 notes a 98 million prepayment makewhole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest we recorded the prepayment makewhole amount and a 32 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt 

taxes on income from continuing operations 



we generate substantial earnings from our nonus operations a number of the nonus jurisdictions in which we file tax returns historically have had tax rates that are lower than the us statutory tax rate as a result our consolidated effective income tax rate for 2021 and earlier years has been substantially below the us statutory tax rate the principal nonus jurisdictions in which the tax rate in 2021 and earlier years was lower than the us statutory tax rate and from which we derived substantial earnings included ireland bermuda and singapore 

the effective income tax rate for 2021 reflects tax expense associated with the respiratory business divestiture the effective tax rate for 2020 reflects nontaxable contingent consideration adjustments recognized in connection with a decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities additionally the effective tax rates for both 2021 and 2020 reflect a net excess tax benefit related to sharebased compensation and a tax benefit relating to the revaluation of state deferred tax assets and liabilities due to business integrations and other changes see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

americas 

americas net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 1943 million or 133 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to a 689 million increase in sales volumes of existing products largely stemming from the impact that the covid19 pandemic had on the prior year net revenues of 606 million generated by the zmedica acquisition a 329 million increase in new product sales and to a lesser extent price increases 

americas operating profit for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 228 million or 57 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales partially offset by a benefit recognized in the prior year resulting from decreases in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities stemming from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and expenses incurred by zmedica 

in november 2021 the center for medicare and medicaid services cms published its physician fee schedule pfs and outpatient prospective payment system opps rates for calendar year 2022 the rules among other things provide for updates with respect to the rates used to determine the reimbursement amounts received by healthcare providers across a broad range of healthcare procedures including our urolift system procedure specifically for urolift procedures performed in a physician office setting the reimbursement rates outlined in the pfs will be reduced by 1921 as compared to 2021 and will be phased in over four years while the reimbursement rates outlined in the opps for urolift procedures performed in the hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgical center setting are 3 higher as compared to 2021 on december 10 2021 president biden signed into law the “protecting medicare and american farmers from sequester cuts act” among other things the law increased the conversion factor in the pfs by 3 for 2022 versus the final rule issued in november while it is uncertain how the changes in reimbursement rates will impact the financial performance of the interventional urology product portfolio over time we do not anticipate the changes will have a significant impact on the financial performance of our interventional urology product portfolio in 2022 we anticipate that this decision may cause our provider community to migrate patients to the ambulatory surgical center or hospital outpatient setting going forward we plan to implement strategies to limit any negative impacts on patient access to safe and effective clinical care in the office setting 

emea 

emea net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 219 million or 38 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to 259 million of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by a 105 million decrease in sales volumes attributed to the respiratory business divestiture 

emea operating profit for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 136 million or 166 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase in gross profit resulting from favorable mix partially offset by an increase in eu mdr costs within research and development 

asia 

asia net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 308 million or 115 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to a 131 million net increase in sales volumes of existing products largely stemming from the impact that the covid19 pandemic had on the prior year 124 million of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and 93 million in new product sales the increases in net revenues were partially offset by a 90 million decrease in sales volumes attributed to the respiratory business divestiture 

asia operating profit for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 334 million or 652 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and a benefit from the reversal of a contingent liability related to tariffs imposed by chinese authorities which is described further in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements the increases in operating profit were partially offset by an increase in selling expenses to support higher sales 

oem 

oem net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 254 million or 115 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to a 137 million increase in sales volumes of existing products largely stemming from the impact that the covid19 pandemic had on the prior year a 58 million increase in new product sales and net revenues generated by the hpc acquisition 

oem operating profit for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 113 million or 253 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing 

activities our principal source of liquidity is our cash flows provided by operating activities our cash flows provided by operating activities are reduced by cash used to among other things fulfill contractual obligations for minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases which often extend beyond one year the weighted average remaining lease term of our operating lease portfolio is 79 years our cash flows provided by operating activities are also reduced by cash used for unconditional legally binding commitments to purchase goods or services ie purchase obligations which primarily related to inventory expected to be purchased within one year our net cash provided by operating activities was significantly in excess of amounts paid pursuant to these contractual obligations for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include contractual obligations such as scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness tax on deemed repatriation of nonus earnings which will be paid annually over the next four years and annual pension funding we may also be obligated to make payments for contingent consideration due to past acquisitions the timing and amount of which may be uncertain and the magnitude of which can vary from year to year other significant factors that affect our liquidity include certain actions controlled by management such as capital expenditures acquisitions dividends and incremental pension and postretirement benefit payments see note 10 note 12 note 15 and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which is provided for under the credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

of our 4451 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2021 3525 million was held at nonus subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis 

in december 2021 we executed an intracompany transfer in which certain intellectual property rights held by several of our subsidiaries were contributed to a nonus subsidiary the transfer accelerated certain taxable income into the year ended december 31 2021 however the related current tax expense of 732 million which is payable in 2022 was substantially offset by the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities 

we have entered into crosscurrency swap agreements with different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate under the terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements we notionally exchanged in the aggregate 750 million for €6531 million the swap agreements which begin to expire in october 2023 are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements we and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement as a result we may be required to pay or be entitled to receive an amount equal to the difference on the expiration or earlier termination dates between the us dollar equivalent of the €6531 million notional amount and the 750 million notional amount if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has increased or declined by 10 from the rate in effect at the inception of these agreements we would receive from or be required to pay to the counterparties an aggregate of approximately 750 million in respect of the notional settlement as of december 31 2021 we had 217 million in current assets and 96 million in noncurrent assets related to the fair value of our crosscurrency swap agreements the swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements however we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with different counterparties all of which are large wellestablished financial institutions 

we may at any time from time to time repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions exchange transactions or otherwise at such price or prices as we deem appropriate such purchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time

cash flows 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 



cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 6521 million during 2021 and 4371 million during 2020 the 2150 million increase was primarily attributable to favorable operating results and lower contingent consideration payments net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations also reflects 338 million of proceeds received from the respiratory business divestiture attributed to performance obligations under the msta which were largely offset by tax payments related to the respiratory business divestiture 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was 1567 million during 2021 primarily consisted of 2240 million in net proceeds from the respiratory business divestiture and capital expenditures of 716 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 7158 million during 2021 which primarily consisted of a net reduction in borrowings of 6345 million resulting from payments made against our senior credit facility using proceeds from the respiratory business divestiture and operating cash flows our borrowings were also impacted by the redemption of the 400 million 2026 notes which was funded using borrowings under the revolving credit facility we also made dividend payments of 636 million and contingent consideration payments of 314 million 

for a discussion of our cash flow comparison for 2020 and 2019 refer to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations this financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us or gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations the most comparable gaap financial measure management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors because it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations pay dividends and fund acquisitions we also use this financial measure for internal managerial purposes and to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain nondiscretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure 



financing arrangements 

  

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 



fixed rate debt comprised 537 and 560 of total debt at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the slight decline in fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings as of december 31 2021 compared to the prior year was due to the redemption of the 2026 notes 

senior credit facility 

on april 5 2019 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement which provides for a 10 billion revolving credit facility and a 700 million term loan facility each of which matures on april 5 2024 the credit agreement replaces a previous credit agreement under which we were provided a 10 billion credit facility and a 750 million term loan facility due 2022 the “prior term loan” the 700 million term loan facility under the credit agreement principally was applied against the remaining 675 million principal balance of the prior term loan 

at our option loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 125 to 200 or at an alternate base rate which is defined as the highest of i the “prime rate” in the us last quoted by the wall street journal ii 050 above the greater of the federal funds rate and the rate comprised of both overnight federal funds and overnight eurodollar borrowings and iii 100 above adjusted libor for a one month interest period plus in each case an applicable margin ranging from 0125 to 100 in each case subject to adjustments based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio generally consolidated total funded indebtedness which is net of “qualified cash” as defined in the credit agreement on the date of determination to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination overdue loans will bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such loans plus 200 

at december 31 2021 we had 1410 million in borrowings outstanding and 18 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 10 billion revolving credit facility 

the credit agreement contains covenants that among other things and subject to certain exceptions place limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness create additional liens enter into a merger consolidation or amalgamation or other defined fundamental changes dispose of certain assets make certain investments or acquisitions pay dividends or make other restricted payments enter into swap agreements or enter into transactions with our affiliates additionally the credit agreement contains financial covenants that subject to specified exceptions require us to maintain a consolidated total net leverage ratio of not more than 450 to 100 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement paid in cash for such period of not less than 350 to 100 as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement 

redemption of 2026 senior notes 

on april 29 2021 we issued a notice of redemption to holders of our outstanding 400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 notes pursuant to the notice of redemption the 2026 notes were redeemed on june 1 2021 the “redemption date” using borrowings under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand at a redemption price equal to 102438 of the principal amount of the 2026 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the redemption date the “redemption price” we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 130 million as a result of the redemption of the 2026 notes 

2027 and 2028 senior notes 

as of december 31 2021 the outstanding principal amount of our 2027 notes and 2028 notes collectively the senior notes was 500 million respectively the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that among other things among other things and subject to certain exceptions limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets and enter into sale leaseback transactions the obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our existing and future 100 owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the credit agreement and by certain of our other 100 owned domestic subsidiaries as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior notes 

accounts receivable securitization 

we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 75 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2021 and 2019 we borrowed the maximum amount available of 75 million under this facility this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate 

this facility as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

allowance for credit losses 

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for credit losses is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable and the losses expected to be incurred over the life of our receivables considerations to determine credit losses include our historical collection experience the length of time an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer information provided by credit rating services as well as the consideration of events or circumstances indicating historic collection rates may not be indicative of future collectability our allowance for credit losses was 108 million and 129 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively which constituted 26 and 30 of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the current portion of the allowance for credit losses which was 60 million and 81 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively was recognized as a reduction of accounts receivable net 

although we maintain an allowance for credit losses to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts if our allowance for credit losses is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim distributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information when necessary we adjust the reserves with a corresponding adjustment to revenue to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions to the estimated rebates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 264 million and 285 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31 2021 within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

inventory utilization 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

we review the net realizable value of inventory each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage our inventory reserve was 427 million and 429 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

longlived assets 

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for example such an assessment may be initiated if as a result of a change in expectations we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets include indefinitelived assets such as goodwill certain trade names and inprocess research and development iprd as well as finitelived intangibles such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives customer relationships intellectual property distribution rights and noncompetition agreements and are generally obtained through acquisition intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value and we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 

the costs of finitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 

goodwill 

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment our reporting units are our operating segments or in certain cases a business one level below our operating segments as the fair values of our reporting units are more likely than not greater than the carrying values no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 

in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a quantitative impairment test described below alternatively we may test goodwill for impairment through the quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis 

under a quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and 

one which is based on revenue and ebitda of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value 

the more significant judgments and assumptions in determining fair value using in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 the discount rates that are used to estimate present value of the future cash flows which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2021 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in the past several years 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting units carrying value to exceed its fair value while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline in this regard if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges moreover changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value in which case we also may incur material impairment charges 

other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test 

in connection with intangible assets acquired in a business combination and quantitative impairment tests we determine the estimated fair value using various methods under the income approach the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets may include revenue growth rates royalty rate discount rate attrition rate and ebitda margin each of these factors and assumptions can significantly impact the value of the intangible asset 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded impairment charges of 67 million related to our decision to abandon intellectual property and other assets primarily associated with our respiratory product portfolio that was not transferred to medline as part of the respiratory business divestiture see restructuring and impairment charges within result of operations above as well as note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on these charges 

sharebased compensation 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant and recognize as expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service periods sharebased 

compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to the expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option sharebased compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units is measured based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date discounted for the risk free interest rate and the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period share based compensation expense for 2021 and 2020 was 229 million and 207 million respectively 

contingent consideration liabilities 

  

in connection with an acquisition we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities using a discounted cash flow analysis significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements decreases in these items may have the opposite effect increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements decreases may have the opposite effect see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities fair value within selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we accrued 98 million and 366 million of contingent consideration respectively

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates the difficulties inherent in such assessments judgments and estimates are particularly challenging because we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions as a result we are at times subject to tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities management must among other things make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and nonus tax settlements changes in tax law and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1432 million and 1550 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there 

remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and nonus tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment we are currently under examination in ireland and germany the ultimate outcome of these examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions 

new accounting standards 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards including estimated effects if any of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions 

we also are exposed to changes in the market trading price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates on december 31 2021 were determined using a base rate of the onemonth libor rate plus the applicable spread 



a change of 10 in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by 86 million based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2021 

foreign currency risk 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to foreign currency risks these risks include exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables as well as intercompany loans relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency and exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period our principal currency exposures relate to the euro chinese renminbi canadian dollar malaysian ringgit mexican peso british pound and czech koruna we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts to attempt to minimize our exposure to these risks gains and losses on these contracts substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions 

as of december 31 2021 the total notional amount for the foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rates swap contracts expressed in us dollars was 3107 million and 7500 million respectively a sensitivity analysis of changes in fair value of these contracts outstanding as of december 31 2021 while not predictive in nature indicated that a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the us dollar 

against all currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these contracts by 789 million the majority of which relates to the crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the accounting treatment of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rates swap contracts

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance however that the objectives of the controls system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on page f2 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated by reference herein 

c change in internal control over financial reporting 

at the beginning of october 2021 we integrated the enterprise resource planning or erp system used by zmedica business with our global erp system this conversion impacts certain interfaces with our customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the tools we use to take orders procure materials schedule production remit billings make payments and perform other business functions we believe that the expanded utilization of the erp system and related changes to processes and internal controls will enhance our internal control over financial reporting by improving the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes while providing us with the ability to scale our business 

other than the erp system upgrade discussed above no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we manufacture our products at approximately 35 manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the united states the us 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 

• development of new products and product line extensions 

• investment in new technologies and broadening the application of our existing technologies 

• expansion of the use of our products in existing markets and introduction of our products into new geographic markets 

• achievement of economies of scale as we continue to expand by utilizing our direct sales force and distribution network to sell new products as well as by increasing efficiencies in our sales and marketing organizations research and development activities and manufacturing and distribution facilities and 

• expansion of our product portfolio through select acquisitions licensing arrangements and business partnerships that enhance expand or expedite our development initiatives or our ability to increase our market share 

our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to bring to market cost effective innovative products that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications as well as developing enhancements to and product line extensions of existing products during 2020 we introduced several product line extensions and three new products our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of class i and class ii medical devices most of which require 510k clearance by the us food and drug administration fda for sale in the us and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510k clearance we believe that seeking 510k clearance or qualifying for 510kexempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii medical devices see government regulation below for additional information 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

beginning in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our other businesses which served the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we became exclusively a medical device company 

in 2017 we completed two large scale acquisitions neotract inc neotract and vascular solutions inc “vascular solutions” neotract was a medical device company that developed and commercialized the urolift system a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or bph vascular solutions was a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures 

we expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives 

restructuring programs 

we continue to execute our footprint realignment and other restructuring programs designed to improve efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution facilities and to a lesser extent our sales and marketing and research and development organizations see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

our markets 

we generally serve three endmarkets hospitals and healthcare providers medical device manufacturers and home care these markets are affected by a number of factors including demographics utilization and reimbursement patterns the following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 derived from each of our end markets 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the us relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the us 

all of our medical devices manufactured or distributed in the us are subject to requirements set forth by the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” and regulations promulgated by the fda under the fdc act which are enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging labeling storage installation servicing marketing importing and exporting of all finished devices intended for human use additional fda requirements include premarket clearance and approval advertising and promotion distribution and postmarket surveillance of our medical devices and establishment of registration and device listing for our facilities 

unless an exemption preamendment grandfather status that is medical devices legally marketed in the us before may 28 1976 or fda enforcement discretion applies each medical device that we market in the us must first receive either clearance as a class i or typically a class ii device after submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval as a class iii device after filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate to the fda that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device a 510kcleared device preamendment device for which fda has not called for pmas or a device with a de novo authorization referred to as the predicate device substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process requires regulatory competence to execute and usually takes four to nine months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed by the fda through the de novo process the process for granting marketing authorization when no substantially equivalent device exists if the fda agrees it is a low to moderate risk device a device not eligible for 510k clearance or de novo authorization is categorized as class iii and must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval also requires specific regulatory competence and is more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k or de novo processes the pma process generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i 510k exempt and class ii devices that require 510k clearance although a few are 510k 

exempt in addition certain modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k clearance or a de novo authorization the sponsor of a clinical trial must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s requirements for investigational device exemptions “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board irb which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve require modifications to or disapprove research to protect the rights safety and welfare of human research subjects the fda may order the temporary or permanent hold or discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects an irb may also require the clinical trial to be halted at a given clinical trial site for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or to adequately ensure the protection of human subjects or may impose other conditions conducting medical device clinical trials is a complex and costly activity and frequently requires the use of outsourced resources that specialize in planning conducting andor monitoring the clinical trial for the medical device manufacturer 

a device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements those regulatory requirements include but are not limited to the following 

• device listing and establishment registration 

• adherence to the quality system regulation “qsr” which requires stringent design testing control documentation complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures 

• labeling including advertising and promotion requirements 

• prohibitions against the promotion of offlabel uses or indications 

• adverse event and malfunction reporting medical device reports or mdrs 

• postapproval restrictions or conditions potentially including postapproval clinical trials or other required testing 

• postmarket surveillance requirements 

• the fda’s recall authority whereby it can require or request the recall of products from the market and 

• reporting and documentation of voluntary corrections or removals 

the fda has issued final regulations regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which requires manufacturers to label or mark certain medical devices andor their packaging with unique identifiers although the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it has required us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements having taken effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2022 

certain of our medical devices are sold in kits that include a drug component such as lidocaine these types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the center for devices and radiological health cdrh under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices “cgmps” and adverse drug experience reporting requirements to the extent applicable to the drugcomponent repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cgmps as well as other regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections by fda personnel to verify compliance with the qsr 21 cfr part 820 as well as other regulatory requirements similar inspections and audits are performed by notified bodies to verify compliance to applicable iso standards eg iso 134852016 by auditing organizations under the medical device single audit program mdsap applicable to regulatory requirements of australia brazil canada japan and the us andor by regulatory authorities to verify compliance with medical device regulations and requirements from the countries in which we distribute product if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with 

applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority under certain circumstances to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

regulation of medical devices outside of the us 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the us in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems manufacturing certification requirements and audits through the mdsap program or other regulatory authority inspections also apply in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices as compared to the predecessor medical device directive including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems economic operators and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices will have until may 2021 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the us targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the us that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

in addition we are subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members effective january 2022 we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives the reported data is available to the public on the cms website failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” imposed regulatory mandates and other measures designed to contain the cost of healthcare in addition to annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals violations of these laws are punishable by a range of fines penalties and other sanctions 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the us that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our 

customer relationships outside of the us are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the us we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the us government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees distributors or other agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods based upon the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture and sterilization of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used the components supplied and the sterilization services provided for our overall operations most of the materials components and sterilization services we utilize are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers however our ability to establish alternate sources of supply of materials and sterilization services may be delayed due to fda and other regulatory authority requirements regarding the manufacture and sterilization of our products volatility in commodity prices particularly with respect to aluminum steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide innovative new safe and effective products that enhance clinical value by 

reducing infections improving patient and clinician safety enhancing patient outcomes and enabling less invasive procedures 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns and to a lesser extent the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products historically we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors 

human capital resources 

as of december 31 2020 we employed approximately 14000 employees including 4000 employees in the us and 10000 employees in 31 other countries around the world our manufacturing employees make up 58 of the total employee population and are located primarily in mexico malaysia and the czech republic our commercial organization comprises 25 of the employee base located throughout the globe the remaining 17 of employees work in various corporate functions based in each of our locations 

we believe our employees are a significant differentiating factor and play a critical role in our ability to deliver on our commitments to patients and execute our strategy to our customers and shareholders our management team places significant focus and attention to matters affecting our people particularly our commitment to our core values capability development total rewards and diversity as well as how each employee experiences our culture

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or stock price the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

risks relating to our business and operations 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products due to among other things our inability to 

• identify viable new products 

• maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our investments in research and development and product acquisitions 

• obtain adequate intellectual property protection 

• gain market acceptance of new products or 

• successfully obtain regulatory approvals 

in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by public health epidemics including the ongoing covid19 global health pandemic 

we are subject to risks associated with public health threats including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and has negatively impacted our operations financial performance and cash flows because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict the pandemic’s impact on our operations and financial performance as well as its impact on our ability to execute our 

business strategies and initiatives successfully remains uncertain and difficult to predict further the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions on travel transport and workforce pressures and deferrals or postponements of elective procedures the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies travel and economic activity the availability of federal state local or nonus funding programs general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the timing and pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides which could be impacted by a number of factors including limited provider capacity to perform procedures using our products that were deferred as a result of the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected and is expected to continue to subject our operations financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

• it has resulted and we expect it will continue to result in lower revenues in certain of our product categories including our interventional urology which revenues are primarily concentrated in our americas segment surgical interventional anesthesia and oem product categories in which we sell products largely utilized in elective procedures which have been significantly reduced or suspended due to the pandemic 

• it has resulted in higher revenues in our respiratory and vascular access product categories however we are unable to predict how long this increased demand will last or how significant it will be 

• it has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products we currently rely on our 35 manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the us to manufacture our products the covid19 pandemic andor the governmental or regulatory actions taken in response to covid19 pandemic may interfere with our ability or that of our employees or suppliers to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business and create a risk to our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or at all we have experienced and expect to continue to experience inefficiencies in our manufacturing operations due to governmentmandated and selfimposed restrictions placed on facilities in certain locations primarily in north america and asia additionally we have experienced and continue to experience a higher than normal level of absenteeism across our global manufacturing sites in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical device products we may elect to or the government may require us to allocate manufacturing capacity for example pursuant to the us defense production act in a way that adversely affects our regular operations and financial results results in differential treatment of customers andor adversely affects our customer relationships and reputation 

• while we have not experienced significant payment defaults by or identified other significant collectability concerns with our customers to date we may be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivables if our customers experience financial difficulties or are unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to pay for our products on a timely basis if at all 

• the covid19 pandemic including related illness border closures travel restrictions quarantines lockdowns or other workforce disruptions could disrupt our suppliers or our suppliers’ suppliers andor the distribution of our products whether through our direct sales force or our distributors these disruptions or our failure to respond to them could increase manufacturing or distribution costs or cause delays in delivering or an inability to deliver products to our customers 

• the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and volatility is likely to continue we might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase 

these and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic or other pandemics or epidemics could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein we might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near or longterm adverse impacts to our results however these effects could have an adverse impact on our liquidity capital resources operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely and such impact could be material 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the 

extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly in some countries medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected in this regard we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations including reductions in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by discouraging customers’ selection of and reducing the prices they are willing to pay for our products 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors have implemented and are continuing to implement cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern among other things the development design clinical testing premarket clearance and approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change 

in the us before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k clearance or de novo authorization or approval of a premarket approval application or pma from the fda similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the us also require clearance approval authorization or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed in the eu the eu mdr will when it enters into full force in may 2021 include significant additional pre and postmarket requirements the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign government authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application or the fda or a foreign government authority may change the classification of a product which could require additional clinical studies and new marketing submissions 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 

• partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing 

• product shortages 

• delays in product manufacturing 

• warning or untitled letters 

• fines or civil penalties 

• delays in or restrictions on obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals 

• withdrawal or suspension of required clearances approvals or licenses 

• product seizures or recalls 

• injunctions 

• criminal prosecution 

• advisories or other field actions 

• operating restrictions and 

• prohibitions against exporting of products to or importing products from countries outside the us 

we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from certain regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated promoting a device for a use outside of the cleared or approved intended use or population that is an offlabel use or making false misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation qsr which requires among other things periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation in addition any facilities assembling kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and requires the reporting of certain recalls or other field safety corrective actions for medical devices issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

• the federal healthcare antikickback statute which among other things prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration one purpose of which is to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase order or recommendation of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid or soliciting payment for such referrals purchases orders and recommendations 

• federal false claims laws which among other things prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government including medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors 

• the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” which prohibits schemes to defraud any healthcare benefit program and false statements relating to healthcare matters and 

• state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws such as antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers 

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the affordable care act imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals effective january 2022 we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse 

midwives the reported information is made publicly available in a searchable format in addition device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california connecticut nevada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including facility consolidations organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce and we may engage in similar efforts in the future while we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning or erp systems most recently we upgraded the erp system used by our emea segment to our global erp system in 2019 to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives however as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

disruptions in sterilization of our products or regulatory initiatives further restricting the use of ethylene oxide in sterilization facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products require sterilization prior to sale a common method for sterilizing medical products involves the use of ethylene oxide which is listed as a hazardous air pollutant under the clean air act as amended and emissions of which are regulated by the us environmental protection agency epa and other regulatory authorities one of our contract sterilizers sterigenics us llc uses ethylene oxide in its sterilization process including at its facilities in smyrna cobb county georgia and santa teresa new mexico which have sterilized some of our vascular surgical intermittent catheter and oem products during the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31 2019 operations at the smyrna facility were suspended by state and local officials due to issues associated with the facilitys use of ethylene oxide in its sterilization operations but have since reopened in december 2020 the new mexico attorney general initiated legal proceedings involving the santa teresa facility alleging that its operations have resulted in impermissible ethylene oxide emissions while both plants are currently operating normally should their operations be suspended or adversely affected our ability to provide affected products to our customers could be impaired if we are unable to utilize alternate facilities and sources for sterilization services 

in addition on october 10 2019 the attorneys general of 15 states and the district of columbia sent a letter to the epa urging that the epa promptly propose and finalize stricter standards for ethylene oxide emissions among 

other things the attorneys general stated that the current epa standard for ethylene oxide fails to adequately protect workers and communities and that the use of ethylene oxide particularly in the medical device sterilization industry must be reduced we are unable to predict the manner in which the epa will respond to the letter any additional regulatory restrictions on the emission of ethylene oxide by sterilization facilities might impair our ability to provide sufficient quantities of sterilized products to our customers and compel us to seek sterilization alternatives that do not entail the use of ethylene oxide we cannot assure that we would be able to identify such alternatives 

in the event we were to experience any further disruptions in our ability to sterilize our products whether due to capacity constraints or regulatory or other impediments including among other things regulatory initiatives directed generally to sterilization facilities that utilize ethylene oxide or we are unable to transition to alternative facilities in a timely or cost effective manner we could experience a material adverse impact with respect to our results of operations and financial condition 

a significant portion of our us revenues is derived from sales to distributors and “destocking” activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues in the us is derived from sales to distributors which in turn sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions from time to time these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products a practice we refer to as “destocking” a distributors decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product distributor buying decisions including decisions to purchase competing products changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels economic conditions and other factors for example during the third quarter of 2016 we experienced a decline in purchases by our us distributors that adversely affected our revenues and results of operations we believe the reduction resulted from the distributors expectations of a less severe 20162017 flu season which resulted in reduced levels of purchasing with respect to certain of our products that are used for treatment of hospitalized patients suffering from the flu following such instances of reduced purchases distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels nevertheless we cannot assure that distributors will in fact increase purchases of our products in this manner a decline in the level of product purchases by our us distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims as well as product recalls any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks related to the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the related legal defense costs may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily conduct or be required by regulatory authorities to conduct a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could harm our reputation decrease demand for our products lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred several years ago led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending resulting in reductions delays or cancellations of 

purchases of our products and services we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors the continuation in a number of markets of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns moreover the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development marketing and other resources as well as significantly greater investments than we anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance as well as the shortterm effects of increased costs on results of operations although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with certain of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay on a quarterly basis we reassess these obligations and in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes we record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings which could have a material impact on our results of operations as of december 31 2020 we accrued 366 million of contingent consideration most of which related to our acquisition of essential medical in addition actual payments may differ materially from the amount of the contingent liability  which could have a material impact on our results of operations cash flows and liquidity for information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities see “critical accounting policies and estimates” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the affordable care act 

• established a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research 

• implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals physicians and other providers to improve the coordination quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models and 

• created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce medicare spending if projected medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in this regard several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the affordable care act were proposed but not adopted in 2017 however us tax legislation adopted in december 2017 and commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tcja eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act and may have other effects moreover on december 14 2018 the us district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid although the court stayed its ruling pending appeal the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act or any court decision regarding the acts validity is uncertain and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on the longerterm viability of the act or on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the us including belgium the czech republic germany ireland malaysia and mexico in addition a significant portion of our nonus revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors as of december 31 2020 approximately 70 of our fulltime employees were employed in countries outside of the us and approximately 50 of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the us in addition for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 38 38 and 41 respectively of our net revenues based on the teleflex entity generating the sale were derived from operations outside the us 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the us including 

• exchange controls currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values 

• trade protection measures tariffs and other duties especially in light of trade disputes between the us and several foreign countries including china 

• potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements 

• laws and business practices that favor local companies 

• changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and procedures 

• subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that currently are or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations 

• substantial nonus tax liabilities including potentially negative consequences resulting from changes in tax laws 

• restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of nonus earnings 

• differing labor regulations 

• additional us and foreign government controls or regulations 

• the impact of the united kingdoms departure from the european union commonly referred to as brexit 

• public health epidemics 

• difficulties in the protection of intellectual property and 

• unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against american interests 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business similar antibribery laws are in effect in several foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees distributors or other agents in addition we may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire violations of antibribery laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions as well as harm to our reputation 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the us including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in us government contracts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates products manufactured in and sold into foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates which we refer to as nonfunctional currencies a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro will affect our us dollarreported revenue and income although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum and steel increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need in addition our borrowing costs have been adversely affected by recent interest rate increases and could be further affected if interest rates continue to increase any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to delays in product releases product shortages unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors including 

• the intense competition for skilled personnel in our industry 

• fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions 

• changes in our organizational structure 

• our restructuring initiatives 

• competitors’ hiring practices and 

• the effectiveness of our compensation programs 

our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our failure to maintain strong relationships with physicians and other health care professionals could adversely affect us 

we depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and as a result no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous us and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the us we cannot assure that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop knowhow and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business 

we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations and employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and may involve significant legal expenses in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders generate invoices collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise perform business functions our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and in some cases have caused significant harm although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur 

expenses lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

regulations related to conflict minerals have caused us to incur additional costs and may adversely affect our business 

in 2012 the sec promulgated rules under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and if so whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country in accordance with applicable regulations we have filed conflict minerals reports annually beginning in 2014 as discussed in these reports we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we have undertaken and continue to undertake efforts to identify where such minerals originated we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups due to among other things our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all moreover we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide products that are drc conflict free we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials 

• emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and 

• the health and safety of our employees 

these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 8 of our employees in the us and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

risks relating to our financing arrangements 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 25 billion 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures research and development efforts and other general corporate expenditures 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds for general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• restrict us from pursuing business opportunities and 

• place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness 

if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

• refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness 

• sell assets 

• reduce or delay capital expenditures or 

• seek to raise additional capital 

we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities and taking other desirable corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 4875 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes and our 4625 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 notes and together with the 2026 notes the senior notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries collectively include limitations on our and their ability to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock or otherwise disqualified stock 

• create liens 

• pay dividends make investments or make other restricted payments 

• sell assets 

• merge consolidate sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and 

• enter into transactions with our affiliates 

in addition our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement a breach of any covenants under any one or more of our debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

under our crosscurrency swap agreements a meaningful decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 

in 2018 and 2019 we entered into crosscurrency swap agreements with several financial institutions to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate the swap agreements require an exchange of the notional amounts between us and the counterparties upon expiration or earlier termination of the agreements if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has declined from the rate in effect on the execution date we are required to pay the counterparties an amount equal to the excess of the us dollar value over the euro principal amount we and the counterparties have agreed to a net settlement with regard to the exchange of the notional amounts at the date of expiration or earlier termination of the 

agreements in the event of a significant decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate our payment obligations to the counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows in this regard if at the expiration or earlier termination of our swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has declined by 10 from the rate in effect at the inception of our agreements we would be required to pay approximately 75 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement to the extent we enter into additional crosscurrency swap agreements a decline in the relevant exchange rates could further adversely affect our cash flows 

risks relating to ownership of our common stock 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding approximately 467 million shares of our common stock options to purchase 12 million shares of our common stock of which approximately 09 million were vested as of that date restricted stock units covering 02 million shares of our common stock which are expected to vest over the next three years performance stock units covering a maximum of 64562 shares of our common stock which may vest in early 2021 depending on our performance with regard to specified financial measures and market performance of our common stock compared to designated public companies and 1391 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan as of december 31 2020 32 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore our issuance of shares upon the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options as well as the vesting of restricted stock units and some or all of the performance stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and the subsequent sale in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings requirements under covenants in our debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our senior notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indentures governing the senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us if an acquisition event constitutes a “change of control” as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in the case of the 2027 notes the right will apply only if the change in control is coupled with a ratings downgrade our obligations under the senior notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock

estimated possible loss that will be incurred to resolve these matters based on information currently available advice of counsel established reserves and other resources we do not believe that any such actions are likely to be individually or in the aggregate material to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows however in the event of unexpected further developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters or other similar matters if unfavorable may be materially adverse to our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits improving patient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications approximately 95 of our net revenues come from singleuse medical devices we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies 

we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives based on our evaluation we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives in addition we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position finally we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship in some instances particularly in asia the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through subdistributors our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel 

on february 18 2020 we acquired iwg high performance conductors inc hpc a privatelyheld original equipment manufacturer of minimally invasive medical products and high performance conductors for an initial cash purchase price of 2600 million the acquisition which complements our oem product portfolio was financed using borrowings under our revolving credit facility

covid19 pandemic and related economic factors 

we continue to experience the effects of the global pandemic caused by the covid19 novel strain of coronavirus among other things the response to the covid19 pandemic has had the effect of reducing the number of elective procedures being carried out which has impacted and continues to impact some of our product categories including our interventional urology surgical interventional anesthesia and oem products which have experienced and continue to experience decreased demand we have also experienced and continue to experience increased demand for products used in the treatment of patients with covid19 which are mostly concentrated in our respiratory and vascular access product categories for the year ended december 31 2020 each of our segments were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic due to the reduction in elective procedures and to a lesser extent as a result of governmentmandated and selfimposed shutdowns in several countries which were implemented to protect individuals and control the spread of covid19 the covid19 pandemic is impacting other elements of our operations as well as our employees contractors suppliers customers freight transport providers and other business partners to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in the global supply chain for our products that are in high demand but in some cases delivery times have lengthened resulting in backorders for some of our products 

in addition there have been and continues to be impacts on our cost structure resulting from measures that we and other businesses are taking or will take in accordance with governmental requirements and otherwise to protect our employees and business partners we continue to assess the impact on our business including our employees customers and suppliers of travel restrictions border closures and quarantines as they affect our various sites including our 35 global manufacturing sites in most jurisdictions our manufacturing and distribution sites remain open because we are considered an essential business however we have experienced temporary or partial work stoppages in some manufacturing sites in north america and asia during the year ended december 31 2020 we experienced and we continue to experience inefficiencies in our manufacturing operations due to governmentmandated and selfimposed restrictions placed on and safety measures implemented at our facilities globally from an operating expense perspective we have experienced and continue to experience net decreases in selling general and administrative expenses as a result of the covid19 pandemic due to cost mitigation efforts implemented to control discretionary spending including selling marketing and travel and entertainment related costs and lower performance related employeebenefit costs 

we have yet to return to the revenue growth levels that we achieved prior to the onset of the pandemic in addition the degree of improvement has varied by product category and by region it is uncertain whether this trend will continue or if we will again experience a decrease in the number of elective procedures performed as the covid19 pandemic evolves particularly if the virus becomes more prevalent as we progress through the winter season in the northern hemisphere or if new strains of the virus continue to emerge overall we believe that the covid19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect our revenues and operations at least over the nearterm because of the dynamic nature of the crisis such as recent regional covid19 outbreaks that are impacting the recovery we cannot accurately predict the extent or duration of the impacts of the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has also had an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions across the countries and regions in which we operate as a result various forms of policy interventions from local governments have been enacted to attempt to initiate an economic recovery while there generally has been some improvement in economic conditions in the later part of 2020 the degree of improvement has been uneven among our regional markets and the uncertain economic trends after the covid19 pandemic constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity 

in addition to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we continue to monitor trade and tariff activity inflation and exchange rate volatility that could impact our financial position results of operations or liquidity in regards to tariff activity we have been subject to an ongoing investigation by the chinese authorities related to a technical error regarding our country of origin designation for certain products we imported into china the error would have resulted in increased tariff payments in late 2018 through 2020 we have accrued the estimated increase in tariffs as well as related interest expense for the periods in question in addition to the tariffs and related interest the chinese authorities may impose a penalty for the unpaid tariffs we believe the range of penalties is between 30 and 200 of the related unpaid tariff or between 30 million and 203 million we do not have a best estimate of the penalties that may be assessed at this time accordingly as prescribed by gaap we have recorded 30 million as low end of the range described above 

government investigation 

in june 2020 we began producing documents and information in response to a civil investigative demand a “cid” received in march 2020 by one of our subsidiaries neotract from the us department of justice through the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of georgia collectively the “doj” the cid relates to the doj’s investigation of a single neotract customer requires the production of documents and information pertaining to communications with and certain rebate programs offered to that customer and pertains to communications and activities occurring both prior to our acquisition of neotract in october 2017 and thereafter in july 2020 the doj advised us that it had opened an investigation under the civil false claims act 31 usc §3729 with respect to neotract’s operations broadly in addition to the customer investigation

as used in this discussion new products are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months and “existing products” are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from any elimination of distributors either through acquisition or termination of the distributor from the sales channel all dollar amounts in tables are presented in millions unless otherwise noted 

for the year ended december 31 2020 intangible asset amortization expense of 844 million is included within costs of good sold for the year ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 we reclassified intangible asset amortization expense of 826 million and 816 million respectively from selling general and administrative expenses to cost of goods sold for comparability certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis which may cause minor differences 

for a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2019 and 2018 refer to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 filed on february 21 2020 

comparison of 2020 and 2019 

revenues 



net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 582 millionor 22compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to a 1082 million net decrease in sales volumes of existing products largely caused by the covid19 pandemic partially offset by net revenues of 271 million generated by the hpc acquisition and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of new products 

gross profit 



for the year ended december 31 2020 gross margin decreased 210 basis points or 39 compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs both caused largely by the covid19 pandemic and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

selling general and administrative 



selling general and administrative expenses decreased 1082 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year the decrease was primarily attributable to a 921 million benefit from reductions in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities which largely related to revenuebased milestone payments due to adverse financial projections resulting from the covid19 pandemic the decrease was also attributable to lower selling and marketing expenses and performance related employeebenefit costs resulting from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

research and development 



research and development expenses increased 58 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to european union medical device regulation eu mdr related costs partially offset by lower project spend within certain of our product portfolios 

restructuring and impairment charges 

2020 workforce reduction plan 

during the second quarter of 2020 we committed to a workforce reduction the 2020 workforce reduction plan designed to improve profitability and reduce cost primarily by streamlining certain sales and marketing functions in our emea segment and certain manufacturing operations in our oem segment the workforce reduction was initiated to further align the business with our high growth strategic objectives the plan was substantially completed by the end of 2020 and we expect future restructuring charges associated with the program if any to be nominal we will achieve annual pretax savings of 12 million as a result of this program 

anticipated charges and pretax savings related to restructuring programs and other similar cost savings initiatives 

we have ongoing restructuring programs primarily related to the consolidation of our manufacturing operations referred to as our 2019 2018 and 2014 footprint realignment plans we also have similar ongoing activities to relocate certain manufacturing operations within our oem segment the oem initiative that do not meet the criteria for a restructuring program under applicable accounting guidance nevertheless the activities should result in cost savings we expect only minimal costs to be incurred in connection with the oem initiative with respect to our currently ongoing restructuring programs and the oem initiative the table below summarizes charges incurred or estimated to be incurred and estimated annual pretax savings to be realized as follows 1 with respect to charges a the estimated total charges that will have been incurred once the restructuring programs and oem initiative are completed b the charges incurred through december 31 2020 and c the estimated charges to be incurred from january 1 2021 through the last anticipated completion date of the restructuring programs and oem initiative and 2 with respect to estimated annual pretax savings a the estimated total annual pretax savings to be realized once the restructuring programs and oem initiative are completed b the estimated annual pretax savings realized based on the progress of the restructuring programs and oem initiative through december 31 2020 and c the estimated additional annual pretax savings to be realized from january 1 2021 through the last anticipated completion date of the restructuring programs and the oem initiative 

estimated charges and pretax savings are subject to change based on among other things the nature and timing of restructuring activities and similar activities changes in the scope of restructuring programs and the oem initiative unanticipated expenditures and other developments the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pretax savings moreover estimated pretax savings constituting efficiencies with respect to increased costs that otherwise would have resulted from business acquisitions involve among other things assumptions regarding the cost structure and integration of businesses that previously were not administered by our management which are subject to a particularly high degree of risk and uncertainty it is likely that estimates of charges and pretax savings will change from time to time and the table below may reflect changes from amounts previously estimated in addition the table below reflects the estimated charges and pretax savings related to our ongoing programs in addition to our 2020 workforce reduction plan additional details including estimated charges expected to be incurred in connection with our restructuring programs and the anticipated completion dates are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

pretax savings may be realized during and subsequent to the completion of the restructuring programs pretax savings can also be affected by increases or decreases in sales volumes generated by the businesses impacted by the consolidation of manufacturing operations such variations in revenues can increase or decrease pretax savings generated by the consolidation of manufacturing operations for example an increase in sales volumes generated by the impacted businesses although likely to increase manufacturing costs may generate additional savings with respect to costs that otherwise would have been incurred if the manufacturing operations were not consolidated 



1 represents charges that are directly related to restructuring programs and principally constitute costs to transfer manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations project management costs and accelerated depreciation as well as a charge that is expected to be imposed by a taxing authority as a result of our exit from facilities in the authoritys jurisdiction most of these charges other than the tax charge are expected to be recognized as cost of goods sold 

2 we expect the oem initiative will be completed by the end of 2027 

3 most of the pretax savings are expected to result in reductions to selling general and administrative expenses 

4 substantially all of the pretax savings are expected to result in reductions to cost of goods sold 

the following discussion provides additional details with respect to our ongoing significant restructuring programs 

2019 footprint realignment plan 

in february 2019 we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations and related workforce reductions the “2019 footprint realignment plan these actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2022 

in 2020 we refined the estimated ranges for the restructuring and restructuring related charges in consideration of the progress made to date as well as the actions remaining the refinements resulted in a decrease to the high end of our estimated ranges compared to our prior estimates and we now estimate that we will incur charges totaling 56 million to 63 million under the plan of which we estimate that 50 million to 57 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays we also expect a decrease in the total capital expenditures compared to 

prior estimates and we now expect to incur 28 million to 33 million in total capital expenditures under the plan most of which we expect to be incurred by the end of 2021 

in 2020 we identified additional cost reduction measures and accelerated certain components of the plan that led to an increase in our estimated annual plan related savings as well as the recognition of savings related to the plan during the year we now expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 15 million to 17 million once the plan is fully implemented 

2018 footprint realignment plan 

in may 2018 we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain european manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations the outsourcing of certain european distribution operations and related workforce reductions during the second quarter 2020 we took advantage of an opportunity to accelerate certain components of this plan and we now expect to be substantially completed by the end of 2022 

we estimate that we will incur total charges in connection with the 2018 footprint realignment plan of 103 million to 133 million of which we estimate that 99 million to 127 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays additionally we expect to incur 19 million to 23 million in total capital expenditures under the plan 

we began realizing planrelated savings in 2018 and expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 25 million to 30 million once the plan is fully implemented 

2014 footprint realignment plan 

in april 2014 we initiated a restructuring plan the 2014 footprint realignment plan involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain highercost locations to existing lowercost locations 

during 2020 we extended our timeline of certain development and qualification activities which resulted in a one year delay in the anticipated period of substantial completion so we now expect the plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2022 the shift in timing along with other changes to the plan also resulted in an increase in the estimated total charges primarily restructuring related charges and related cash outlays in addition to a decrease in the estimated total capital expenditures compared to prior estimates we adjusted the corresponding ranges in consideration of these changes in estimates and we now estimate that we will incur total charges of 52 million to 55 million which we expect will result in cash outlays of 42 million to 46 million and total capital expenditures of 26 million to 27 million under the plan 

in 2020 we also identified additional cost reduction measures as the plan progressed and as a result we increased our estimate of annual planrelated savings we now estimate that we will achieve annual pretax savings of 28 million to 31 million once the plan is fully implemented 

the following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our restructuring programs as well as impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits 



1 impairment charges recognized in 2020 related primarily to our decision to abandon intellectual property and other assets related to the percuvance percutaneous surgical system product line impairment charges recognized in 2019 and 2018 related to our decision to abandon certain intellectual property and other assets associated with products that were eliminated from our interventional product portfolio 

interest expense   



the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a lower average interest rate resulting from decreases in interest rates associated with our variable interest rate debt instruments partially offset by increases in average debt outstanding 

loss on extinguishment of debt   



on november 15 2019 we prepaid the 250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount under our 2024 notes in addition to our prepayment of principal we paid to the holders of the 2024 notes a 65 million prepayment makewhole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest we recorded the prepayment makewhole amount and a 23 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt 

gain on sale of assets 



during the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized a gain related to the sale of two buildings and our vein catheter reprocessing business 

taxes on income from continuing operations   



we generate substantial earnings from our nonus operations a number of the nonus jurisdictions in which we file tax returns historically have had tax rates that are lower than the us statutory tax rate as a result our consolidated effective income tax rate for 2020 and earlier years has been substantially below the us statutory tax rate the principal nonus jurisdictions in which the tax rate in 2020 and earlier years was lower than the us statutory tax rate and from which we derive substantial earnings included ireland bermuda and singapore 

the effective income tax rate for 2020 was 61 compared to 359 for 2019 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2020 reflects nontaxable contingent consideration adjustments recognized in connection with a decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities the effective income tax rate for 2019 reflects a tax benefit of 129 million resulting from a nonus legal entity restructuring that eliminated the requirement to provide for withholding taxes on the future repatriation of certain nonpermanently reinvested earnings additionally the effective tax rates for both 2020 and 2019 reflect a net excess tax benefit related to sharebased compensation and a tax benefit relating to the revaluation of state deferred tax assets and liabilities due to business integrations and other changes see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

americas operating profit for the year ended december 31 2020 increased 815 million or 255 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to a benefit from a reduction in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities which largely relate to revenuebased milestone payments due to adverse financial projections resulting from the covid19 pandemic the increase in operating profit was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit resulting from lower sales caused by the covid19 pandemic 

emea

emea operating profit for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 131 million or 138 compared to the prior year which was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross profit resulting from lower sales and higher manufacturing costs both caused by the covid19 pandemic and an increase in research and development expenses the decreases in operating profit were partially offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses 

asia 

asia net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 273 million or 93 compared to the prior year the decrease was primarily attributable to a 363 million net decrease in sales volumes of existing products caused by the covid19 pandemic partially offset by an increase in sales of new products

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is our cash flows provided by operating activities our cash flows provided by operating activities are reduced by cash used to among other things fulfill contractual obligations for minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases which often extend beyond one year the weighted average remaining lease term of our operating lease portfolio is 67 years years our cash flows provided by operating activities are also reduced by cash used for unconditional legally binding commitments to purchase goods or services ie purchase obligations which primarily related to inventory expected to be purchased within one year our net cash provided by operating activities was significantly in excess of amounts paid pursuant to these contractual obligations for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include contractual obligations such as scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness tax on deemed repatriation of nonus earnings which will be paid annually over the next 5 years and annual pension funding we may also be obligated to make payments for contingent consideration due to past acquisitions the timing and amount of which may be uncertain and the magnitude of which can vary from year to year other significant factors that affect our liquidity include certain actions controlled by management such as capital expenditures acquisitions dividends and incremental pension and postretirement benefit payments see note 12 note 15 and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our contractual obligations at december 31 2020 were as follows 



1 interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december 31 2020 

2 purchase and other obligations are defined as unconditional commitments to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including quantities to be purchased price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the amounts include commitments for inventory purchases and capital expenditures which at the time we entered into the commitments did not exceed our projected requirements in the normal course of business and penalties due upon cancellation of cancellable agreements the amounts exclude operating lease obligations which are addressed elsewhere in the table 

3 as permitted by the tcja we have elected to pay the tax in annual installments over eight years 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which is provided for under the credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

of our 3759 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 3104 million was held at nonus subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis 

we have entered into crosscurrency swap agreements with different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate under the terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements we notionally exchanged in the aggregate 750 million for €6531 million the swap agreements which begin to expire in october 2023 are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements we and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement as a result we may be required to pay or be entitled to receive an amount equal to the difference on the expiration or earlier termination dates between the us dollar 

equivalent of the €6531 million notional amount and the 750 million notional amount if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has increased or declined by 10 from the rate in effect at the inception of these agreements we would receive from or be required to pay to the counterparties an aggregate of approximately 750 million in respect of the notional settlement as of december 31 2020 we had 201 in current assets and 341 million in long term liabilities related to the fair value of our crosscurrency swap agreements the swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements however we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with different counterparties all of which are large wellestablished financial institutions 

we may at any time from time to time repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions exchange transactions or otherwise at such price or prices as we deem appropriate such purchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time

cash flows 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 



cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 4371 million during 2020 and 2019 in 2020 the cash flows from operations reflect an increase in contingent consideration payments and tax payments that were partially offset by favorable changes in other working capital the favorable changes in working capital were driven mainly by higher accounts receivable collections 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 8378 million during 2020 which included 7678 million in net payments for acquired businesses primarily zmedica and hpc capital expenditures of 907 million and net interest proceeds on swaps designated as net investment hedges of 193 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was 4552 million during 2020 which reflected a net increase in borrowings of 5750 million primarily resulting from the issuance of 500 million of 425 senior notes due 2028 the 2028 notes and additional borrowings totaling 750 million under our revolving credit facility and securitization program net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2020 also reflects contingent consideration payments of 672 million and dividend payments of 632 million 

for a discussion of our cash flow comparison for 2019 and 2018 refer to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 

free cash flow 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations this financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us or gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations the most comparable gaap financial measure management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors because it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations pay dividends and fund acquisitions we also use this financial measure for internal managerial purposes and to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain nondiscretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure 



financing arrangements 

  

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 



fixed rate debt comprised 560 and 468 of total debt at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings as of december 31 2020 compared to the prior year was driven by the issuance of the 2028 notes 

senior credit facility 

on april 5 2019 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement which provides for a 10 billion revolving credit facility and a 700 million term loan facility each of which matures on april 5 2024 the credit agreement replaces a previous credit agreement under which we were provided a 10 billion credit facility and a 750 million term loan facility due 2022 the “prior term loan” the 700 million term loan facility under the credit agreement principally was applied against the remaining 675 million principal balance of the prior term loan 

at our option loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted libor plus an applicable margin ranging from 125 to 200 or at an alternate base rate which is defined as the highest of i the “prime rate” in the us last quoted by the wall street journal ii 050 above the greater of the federal funds rate and the rate comprised of both overnight federal funds and overnight eurodollar borrowings and iii 100 above adjusted libor for a one month interest period plus in each case an applicable margin ranging from 0125 to 100 in each case subject to adjustments based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio generally consolidated total funded indebtedness which is net of “qualified cash” as defined in the credit agreement on the date of determination to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination overdue loans will bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such loans plus 200

for additional information regarding our indebtedness see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

allowance for credit losses 

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for credit losses is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable after considering our historical collection experience the length of time an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer information provided by credit rating services in addition to new requirements under the accounting guidance effective january 1 2020 that includes the consideration of events or circumstances indicating historic collection rates may not be indicative of future collectability for example potential customer liquidity concerns resulting from covid19 that may impact the collectability of our receivables as well as our estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of our receivables our allowance for credit losses 

was 129 million and 91 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively which constituted 30 and 21 of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the current portion of the allowance for credit losses which was 81 million and 53 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively was recognized as a reduction of accounts receivable net 

although we maintain allowance for credit losses to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts if our allowance for credit losses is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim distributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information when necessary we adjust the reserves with a corresponding adjustment to revenue to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions to the estimated rebates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 285 million and 216 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31 2020 within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

inventory utilization 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

we review the net realizable value of inventory each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage 

longlived assets 

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for example such an assessment may be initiated if as a result of a change in expectations we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

intangible assets include indefinitelived assets such as goodwill certain trade names and inprocess research and development iprd as well as finitelived intangibles such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives customer relationships intellectual property distribution rights and noncompetition agreements and are generally obtained through acquisition intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value and we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 

the costs of finitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will 

have different useful lives goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 

goodwill 

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2020 

in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test described below test described below alternatively we may test goodwill for impairment through the twostep quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value in performing the first step we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which we determine in the second step of the twostep test the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 

the more significant judgments and assumptions in determining fair value using in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2020 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in the past several years 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting units carrying value to exceed its fair value while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline in this regard if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges moreover changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value in which case we also may incur material impairment charges 

other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test 

in connection with intangible assets acquired in a business combination and quantitative impairment tests we determine the estimated fair value using various methods under the income approach the more significant judgements and assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets may include revenue growth rates royalty rate discount rate attrition rate and ebitda margin each of these factors and assumptions can significantly impact the value of the intangible asset 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized impairment charges of 214 million related primarily to our decision to abandon intellectual property and other assets related to the percuvance percutaneous surgical system product line see restructuring and impairment charges within result of operations above as well as note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on these charges 

sharebased compensation 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant and recognize as expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option sharebased compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units is measured based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date discounted for the risk free interest rate and the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period share based compensation expense for 2020 and 2019 was 207 million and 269 million respectively 

contingent consideration liabilities 

  

in connection with an acquisition we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities using a monte carlo valuation approach which simulates future revenues during the earn outperiod using managements best estimates and other probabilityweighted discounted cash flow analysis significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements decreases in these items may have the opposite effect increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements decreases may have the opposite effect see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities fair value within selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income as 

of december 31 2020 and 2019 we accrued 366 million and 2199 million of contingent consideration respectively 

income taxes 

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates the difficulties inherent in such assessments judgments and estimates are particularly challenging because we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions as a result we are at times subject to tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities management must among other things make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and nonus tax settlements changes in tax law and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1550 million and 1192 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and nonus tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment we are currently under examination in ireland and germany the ultimate outcome of this examination could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions 

new accounting standards 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards including estimated effects if any of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions 

we also are exposed to changes in the market trading price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates on december 31 2020 were determined using a base rate of the onemonth libor rate plus the applicable spread 



a change of 10 in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by 110 million based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2020 

foreign currency risk 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to foreign currency risks these risks include exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables as well as intercompany loans relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency and exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period our principal currency exposures relate to the euro chinese renminbi mexican peso canadian dollar malaysian ringgit czech koruna british pound indian rupee and japanese yen we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts to attempt to minimize our exposure to these risks gains and losses on these contracts substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions 

as of december 31 2020 the total notional amount for the foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rates swap contracts expressed in us dollars was 2930 million and 7500 million respectively a sensitivity analysis of changes in fair value of these contracts outstanding as of december 31 2020 while not predictive in nature indicated that a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these contracts by 845 million the majority of which relates to the crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the accounting treatment of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rates swap contracts 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance however that the objectives of the controls system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected we acquired hpc and zmedica on february 18 2020 and december 28 2020 respectively consistent with the guidance provided by the staff of the securities and exchange commission management has excluded these acquisitions from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 the net revenues attributable to hpc and zmedica from their respective dates of acquisition through december 31 2020 represent in the aggregate 1 of our consolidated net revenues for the year then ended and total assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets represent in the aggregate less than 1 of our consolidated total assets as of december 31 2020 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on page f2 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated by reference herein 

c change in internal control over financial reporting 

at the beginning of november 2020 we integrated the enterprise resource planning or erp system used by our interventional urology business with our global erp system this conversion impacts certain interfaces with our customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the tools we use to take orders procure materials schedule production remit billings make payments and perform other business functions we believe that the expanded utilization of the erp system and related changes to processes and internal controls will enhance our internal control over financial reporting by improving the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes while providing us with the ability to scale our business 

other than the erp system upgrade discussed above no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we manufacture our products at approximately 35 manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the united states the us 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 

• development of new products and product line extensions 

• investment in new technologies and broadening the application of our existing technologies 

• expansion of the use of our products in existing markets and introduction of our products into new geographic markets 

• achievement of economies of scale as we continue to expand by utilizing our direct sales force and distribution network to sell new products as well as by increasing efficiencies in our sales and marketing organizations research and development activities and manufacturing and distribution facilities and 

• expansion of our product portfolio through select acquisitions licensing arrangements and business partnerships that enhance expand or expedite our development initiatives or our ability to increase our market share 

our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to bring to market cost effective innovative products that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications as well as developing enhancements to and product line extensions of existing products during 2019 we introduced several product line extensions and five new products our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of class i and class ii medical devices most of which require 510k clearance by the us food and drug administration fda for sale in the us and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510k clearance we believe that seeking 510k clearance or qualifying for 510kexempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii medical devices see government regulation below for additional information 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

beginning in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our other businesses which served the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we became exclusively a medical device company 

in 2017 we completed two large scale acquisitions neotract inc neotract and vascular solutions inc “vascular solutions” neotract was a medical device company that developed and commercialized the urolift system a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic 

hyperplasia or bph vascular solutions was a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures 

we expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives 

restructuring programs 

we continue to execute our footprint realignment and other restructuring programs designed to improve efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution facilities and to a lesser extent our sales and marketing and research and development organizations see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our segments 

during 2019 our chief operating decision maker our chief executive officer changed the manner in which he reviews financial information for purposes of assessing business performance and allocating resources by focusing on the geographic location of all nonoem operations as a result we changed our segment presentation specifically the vascular north america interventional north america anesthesia north america surgical north america interventional urology north america respiratory north america and latin america operating segments were combined into a new americas segment we now have four segments americas emea europe the middle east and africa asia asia pacific and oem original equipment manufacturer and development services 

each of our three geographic segments provides a comprehensive portfolio of medical technology products used by hospitals and healthcare providers however certain of our products are more heavily concentrated within certain segments for example most of our urology products are sold by our emea segment and most of our interventional urology products are sold by our americas segment our product portfolio is described in the products section below 

our oem segment designs manufactures and supplies devices and instruments for other medical device manufacturers our oem division which includes the tfx oem and deknatel oem brands provides customengineered extrusions diagnostic and interventional catheters balloons and balloon catheters sheathdilator sets introducers and kits sutures performance fibers and bioresorbable resins and fibers 

the following charts depict our net revenues by reportable operating segment as a percentage of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 

our products 

our product categories within our geographic segments include vascular access anesthesia interventional surgical interventional urology respiratory and urology each of these categories and the key products sold therein are described in more detail below 

vascular access our vascular access product category offers devices that facilitate a variety of critical care therapies and other applications with a primary focus on helping reduce vascularrelated complications these products primarily consist of our arrow branded catheters and related devices including catheter positioning systems in addition to our intraosseous or in the bone access systems

urology our urology product portfolio provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and individuals in the home care markets the product portfolio consists principally of a wide range of catheters including foley intermittent external and suprapubic urine collectors catheterization accessories and products for operative endourology which are marketed under the rusch brand name our urology product portfolio is most heavily weighted in our emea segment 

our markets 

we generally serve three endmarkets hospitals and healthcare providers medical device manufacturers and home care these markets are affected by a number of factors including demographics utilization and reimbursement patterns the following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 derived from each of our end markets 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the us relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the us 

all of our medical devices manufactured or distributed in the us are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” and its implementing regulations which are enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design manufacture packaging labeling storage installation servicing marketing importing and exporting of all finished devices intended for human use additional fda requirements include premarket clearance and approval advertising and promotion distribution postmarket surveillance import and export of our medical devices 

unless an exemption preamendment grandfather status or fda enforcement discretion applies each medical device that we market in the us must first receive either clearance as a class i or typically a class ii device by submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval as a class iii device by filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device a 510kcleared device preamendment device for which fda has not called for pmas or a device with a de novo authorization referred to as the predicate device substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process requires regulatory competence to execute and usually takes four to nine months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process the process for granting marketing authorization when no substantially equivalent device exists if the fda agrees it is a low to moderate risk device a device not eligible for 510k clearance or de novo authorization is categorized as class iii and must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval also requires specific regulatory competence and is more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k or de novo process it generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i 510k exempt and class ii devices that require 510k clearance although a few are 510kexempt in addition certain modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k clearance or a de novo authorization the sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s requirements for investigational device exemptions “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board irb which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve require modifications in or disapprove research to protect the rights safety and welfare of the human research subject the fda may order the temporary or permanent hold or discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects an irb may also require the clinical trial to be halted at a given clinical trial site for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or failure to adequately ensure the protection of human subjects or may impose other conditions conducting medical device clinical trials is a complex and costly activity and frequently requires the use of outsourced resources that specialize in planning and conducting the clinical trial for the medical device manufacturer 

a device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements those regulatory requirements include the following 

• device listing and establishment registration 

• adherence to the quality system regulation “qsr” which requires stringent design testing control documentation complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures 

• labeling requirements 

• prohibitions against the promotion of offlabel uses or indications 

• adverse event and malfunction reporting medical device reports or mdrs 

• postapproval restrictions or conditions potentially including postapproval clinical trials or other required testing 

• postmarket surveillance requirements 

• the fda’s recall authority whereby it can require or request the recall of products from the market and 

• reporting and documentation of voluntary corrections or removals 

the fda has issued final regulations regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which requires manufacturers to label or mark certain medical devices andor their packaging with unique identifiers although the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it has required us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements having taken effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2022 

certain of our medical devices are sold in kits that include a drug component such as lidocaine these types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the center for devices and radiological health cdrh under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices “cgmps” and adverse drug experience reporting requirements to the extent applicable to the drugcomponent repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cgmps as well as other regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections by fda personnel to verify compliance with the qsr 21 cfr part 820 as well as other regulatory requirements similar inspections are performed by notified bodies to verify compliance to applicable iso standards eg iso 134852016 requirements under the medical device single audit program mdsap applicable to regulatory requirements australia brazil canada japan and the us andor medical device regulations and requirements from the countries in which we distribute product and other specified audits by regulatory authorities if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to 

permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority under certain circumstances to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

regulation of medical devices outside of the us 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the us in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems manufacturing certification requirements and audits through the mdsap program or other regulatory authority inspections also apply in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices as compared to the predecessor medical device directive including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems economic operators and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices will have until may 2020 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the us targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the us that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

we are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members effective january 2022 we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives the reported data is available to the public on the cms website failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the us that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the us are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the us we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or 

other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the us government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees distributors or other agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods based upon the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture and sterilization of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used the components supplied and the sterilization services provided for our overall operations most of the materials components and sterilization services we utilize are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers however our ability to establish alternate sources of supply of materials and sterilization services may be delayed due to fda and other regulatory authority requirements regarding the manufacture and sterilization of our products volatility in commodity prices particularly with respect to aluminum steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide innovative new safe and effective products that enhance clinical value by reducing infections improving patient and clinician safety enhancing patient outcomes and enabling less invasive procedures 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns and to a lesser extent the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products historically we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors 

employees 

we employed approximately 14400 fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2019 of these employees approximately 3900 were employed in the us and 10500 in countries other than the us approximately 13 of our employees in the us and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collectivebargaining arrangements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

environmental 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the us our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes while we continue to devote resources to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows further we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or stock price the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive 

products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products due to among other things our inability to 

• identify viable new products 

• maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our investments in research and development and product acquisitions 

• obtain adequate intellectual property protection 

• gain market acceptance of new products or 

• successfully obtain regulatory approvals 

in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly in some countries medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected in this regard we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations including reductions in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by discouraging customers’ selection of and reducing the prices they are willing to pay for our products 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors have implemented and are continuing to implement cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern among other things the development design clinical testing premarket clearance and approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change 

in the us before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k clearance or de novo authorization or approval of a premarket approval application or pma from the fda similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the us also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed in the eu the eu mdr will when it enters into full force in may 2020 include significant additional pre and postmarket requirements the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign government authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 

• partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing 

• product shortages 

• delays in product manufacturing 

• warning or untitled letters 

• fines or civil penalties 

• delays in or restrictions on obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals 

• withdrawal or suspension of required clearances approvals or licenses 

• product seizures or recalls 

• injunctions 

• criminal prosecution 

• advisories or other field actions 

• operating restrictions and 

• prohibitions against exporting of products to or importing products from countries outside the us 

we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from certain regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated promoting a device for a use outside of the cleared or approved intended use or population that is an offlabel use or making false misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation qsr which requires among other things periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation in addition any facilities assembling kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and requires the reporting of certain recalls or other field safety corrective actions for medical devices issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

• the federal healthcare antikickback statute which among other things prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration one purpose of which is to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase order or recommendation of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid or soliciting payment for such referrals purchases orders and recommendations 

• federal false claims laws which among other things prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government including medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors 

• the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” which prohibits schemes to defraud any healthcare benefit program and false statements relating to healthcare matters and 

• state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws such as antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers 

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals effective january 2022 we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives the reported information is made publicly available in a searchable format in addition device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california connecticut nevada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including facility consolidations organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce and we may engage in similar efforts in the future while we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring realignment and cost 

reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning or erp systems most recently we upgraded the erp system used by our emea segment to our global erp system in 2019 to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives however as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

disruptions in sterilization of our products or regulatory initiatives further restricting the use of ethylene oxide in sterilization facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

many of our products require sterilization prior to sale a common method for sterilizing medical products involves the use of ethylene oxide which is listed as a hazardous air pollutant under the clean air act as amended and emissions of which are regulated by the us environmental protection agency and other regulatory authorities one of our contract sterilizers sterigenics us llc uses ethylene oxide in its sterilization process including at its facility in smyrna cobb county georgia which has sterilized some of our surgical intermittent catheter and oem products during the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31 2019 operations at the smyrna facility were suspended by state and local officials due to issues associated with the facilitys use of ethylene oxide in its sterilization operations during the suspension our ability to provide affected products to our customers was impaired while we have secured alternate sterilization facilities for the affected product based on currently available information we believe that the disruption in the supply of our product will adversely affect our 2020 revenues by 5 million to 7 million our 2020 revenues may be further adversely affected if we experience any significant difficulties or delays in accessing the sterilization capacity at the alternate facilities 

in addition on october 10 2019 the attorneys general of 15 states and the district of columbia sent a letter to the epa urging that the epa promptly propose and finalize stricter standards for ethylene oxide emissions among other things the attorneys general stated that the current epa standard for ethylene oxide fails to adequately protect workers and communities and that the use of ethylene oxide particularly in the medical device sterilization industry must be reduced we are unable to predict the manner in which the epa will respond to the letter any additional regulatory restrictions on the emission of ethylene oxide by sterilization facilities might impair our ability to provide sufficient quantities of sterilized products to our customers and compel us to seek sterilization alternatives that do not entail the use of ethylene oxide we cannot assure that we would be able to identify such alternatives 

in the event we were to experience any further disruptions in our ability to sterilize our products whether due to capacity constraints or regulatory or other impediments including among other things regulatory initiatives directed generally to sterilization facilities that utilize ethylene oxide or we are unable to transition to alternative facilities in a timely or cost effective manner we could experience a material adverse impact with respect to our results of operations and financial condition 

a significant portion of our us revenues is derived from sales to distributors and “destocking” activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues in the us is derived from sales to distributors which in turn sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions from time to time these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products a practice we refer to as “destocking” a distributors decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product distributor buying decisions including decisions to purchase competing products changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels economic conditions and other factors for example during the third quarter of 2016 we experienced a decline in purchases by our us distributors that adversely affected our revenues and results of operations we believe the reduction resulted from the distributors expectations of a less severe 20162017 flu season which resulted in reduced levels of purchasing with respect to certain of our products that are used for treatment of hospitalized patients suffering from the flu following such instances of reduced purchases distributors may revert to previous 

purchasing levels nevertheless we cannot assure that distributors will in fact increase purchases of our products in this manner a decline in the level of product purchases by our us distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims as well as product recalls any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the related legal defense costs may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily conduct or be required by regulatory authorities to conduct a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could harm our reputation decrease demand for our products lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred several years ago led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending resulting in reductions delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services despite improvements in recent years particularly in the us economic conditions continue to cause disruption in some financial markets resulting in among other things diminished liquidity and credit availability we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors the continuation in a number of markets of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns moreover the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development marketing and other resources as well as significantly greater investments than we anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance as well as the shortterm effects of increased costs on results of operations although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with certain of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay on a quarterly basis we reassess these obligations and in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes we record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings which could have a material impact on our results of operations as of december 31 2019 we accrued 2199 million of contingent consideration most of which related to our acquisition of neotract in addition actual payments may differ materially from the amount of the contingent liability  which could have a material impact on our results of operations cash flows and liquidity for information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities see “critical accounting policies and estimates” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the affordable care act 

• established a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research 

• implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals physicians and other providers to improve the coordination quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models and 

• created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce medicare spending if projected medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in this regard several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the affordable care act were proposed but not adopted in 2017 however us tax legislation adopted in december 2017 and commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tcja eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act and may have other effects moreover on december 14 2018 the us district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid although the court stayed its ruling pending appeal the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act or any court decision regarding the acts validity is uncertain 

and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on the longerterm viability of the act or on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the us including belgium the czech republic germany ireland malaysia and mexico in addition a significant portion of our nonus revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors as of december 31 2019 73 of our fulltime and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the us and approximately 45 of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the us in addition for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 38 41 and 42 respectively of our net revenues based on the teleflex entity generating the sale were derived from operations outside the us 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the us including 

• exchange controls currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values 

• trade protection measures tariffs and other duties especially in light of trade disputes between the us and several foreign countries including china 

• potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements 

• laws and business practices that favor local companies 

• changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and procedures 

• subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that currently are or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations 

• substantial nonus tax liabilities including potentially negative consequences resulting from changes in tax laws 

• restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of nonus earnings 

• differing labor regulations 

• additional us and foreign government controls or regulations 

• the impact of the united kingdoms departure from the european union commonly referred to as brexit 

• public health epidemics 

• difficulties in the protection of intellectual property and 

• unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against american interests 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business similar antibribery laws are in effect in several foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees distributors or other agents in addition we may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire violations of antibribery laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions as well as harm to our reputation 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the us including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in us government contracts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by public health epidemics including the novel coronavirus reported to have originated in wuhan china 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if a public health epidemic including the novel coronavirus referred to as covid19 reported to have originated in wuhan china interferes with our ability or that of our employees contractors suppliers customers and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business a public health epidemic including the coronavirus poses the risk that we or our employees contractors suppliers customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities we face similar risks if a public health epidemic including the coronavirus affects other geographic areas where our employees contractors suppliers customers and other business partners are located 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates products manufactured in and sold into foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates which we refer to as nonfunctional currencies a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro will affect our us dollarreported revenue and income although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum and steel increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need in addition our borrowing costs have been adversely affected by recent interest rate increases and could be further affected if interest rates continue to increase any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

under our crosscurrency swap agreements a meaningful decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 

in 2018 and 2019 we entered into crosscurrency swap agreements with several financial institutions to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate the swap agreements require an exchange of the notional amounts between us and the counterparties upon expiration or earlier termination of the 

agreements if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has declined from the rate in effect on the execution date we are required to pay the counterparties an amount equal to the excess of the us dollar value over the euro principal amount we and the counterparties have agreed to a net settlement with regard to the exchange of the notional amounts at the date of expiration or earlier termination of the agreements in the event of a significant decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate our payment obligations to the counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows in this regard if at the expiration or earlier termination of our swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has declined by 10 from the rate in effect at the inception of our agreements we would be required to pay approximately 75 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement to the extent we enter into additional crosscurrency swap agreements a decline in the relevant exchange rates could further adversely affect our cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws including the impact of the enactment of the tcja any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to delays in product releases product shortages unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors including 

• the intense competition for skilled personnel in our industry 

• fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions 

• changes in our organizational structure 

• our restructuring initiatives 

• competitors’ hiring practices and 

• the effectiveness of our compensation programs 

our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our failure to maintain strong relationships with physicians and other health care professionals could adversely affect us 

we depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and as a result no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the us and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous us and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the us we cannot assure that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop knowhow and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business 

we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations and employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and may involve significant legal expenses in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2019 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 19 billion 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures research and development efforts and other general corporate expenditures 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds for general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• restrict us from pursuing business opportunities and 

• place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness 

if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

• refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness 

• sell assets 

• reduce or delay capital expenditures or 

• seek to raise additional capital 

we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities and taking other desirable corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 4875 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes and our 4625 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 notes and together with the 2026 notes the senior notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries collectively include limitations on our and their ability to among other things 

• incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock or otherwise disqualified stock 

• create liens 

• pay dividends make investments or make other restricted payments 

• sell assets 

• merge consolidate sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets and 

• enter into transactions with our affiliates 

in addition our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement a breach of any covenants under any one or more of our debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration 

of all of our debt in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2019 we had outstanding approximately 460 million shares of our common stock options to purchase 13 million shares of our common stock of which approximately 10 million were vested as of that date restricted stock units covering 02 million shares of our common stock which are expected to vest over the next three years performance stock units covering a maximum of 46660 shares of our common stock which may vest in early 2021 depending on our performance with regard to specified financial measures and market performance of our common stock compared to designated public companies and 1767 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan as of december 31 2019 34 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore our issuance of shares upon the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options as well as the vesting of restricted stock units and some or all of the performance stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and the subsequent sale in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders generate invoices collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise perform business functions our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and in some cases have caused significant harm although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur expenses lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

regulations related to conflict minerals have caused us to incur additional costs and may adversely affect our business 

in 2012 the sec promulgated rules under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and if so whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country in accordance with applicable regulations we have filed conflict minerals reports annually beginning in 2014 as discussed in these reports we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we have undertaken and continue to undertake efforts to identify where such minerals originated we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers 

that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups due to among other things our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all moreover we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide products that are drc conflict free we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

• the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials 

• emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and 

• the health and safety of our employees 

these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2019 approximately 13 of our employees in the us and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings requirements under covenants in our debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our senior notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indentures governing the senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us if an acquisition event constitutes a “change of control” as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in the case of the 2027 notes the right will apply only if the change in control is coupled with a ratings downgrade 

our obligations under the senior notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits improving patient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies 

we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives based on our evaluation we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives in addition we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position finally we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship in some instances particularly in asia the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through subdistributors our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel 

in february 2019 and may 2018 we initiated restructuring plans primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations and related workforce reductions the “2019 footprint realignment plan and the 2018 footprint realignment plan respectively the 2019 footprint realignment and the 2018 footprint realignment plan are expected to be substantially completed during 2022 and 2024 respectively for additional information on both of these plans and a discussion of our other ongoing restructuring programs see  restructuring and impairment charges  under “results of operations” below 

disruption in sterilization services 

during the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31 2019 operations at the smyrna cobb county georgia facility of one of our contract sterilizers sterigenics us llc were suspended by state and local officials due to issues associated with the facility’s use of ethylene oxide in its sterilization operations the suspension of operations at the smyrna facility resulted in a disruption in supply with respect to some of our surgical intermittent catheter and oem products we utilized various measures to enable us to continue to provide the affected products to our customers including alternate sterilization facilities provisioning substitute products and instituting targeted global inventory management procedures nevertheless we estimate the adverse impact from the suspension of operations at sterigenics’ smyrna facility adversely affected our 2019 revenues by approximately 7 million during the fourth quarter of 2019 while we have secured alternate sterilization facilities for the affected products based on currently available information we believe that the disruption in the supply of our product will adversely affect our 2020 revenues by 5 million to 7 million our 2020 revenues may be further adversely affected if we experience any significant difficulties or delays in accessing the sterilization capacity at the alternate facilities for additional information see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this report 

us tax legislation 

us tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was enacted on december 22 2017 the legislation significantly changed us tax law by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to 21 implementing a territorial tax system generally providing for among other things a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a nonus corporation if specified conditions are met and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on undistributed post1986 earnings and profits of nonus subsidiaries which will be deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of us gaap in situations where a company does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income 

tax effects of the tcja sab 118 states that in these circumstances if we can determine a reasonable estimate for the income tax effects the sec staff would not object if the company includes in its financial statements the reasonable estimate it has determined and the sec staff also expressed its belief that it would not be appropriate for a company to exclude a reasonable estimate from its financial statements to the extent a reasonable estimate has been determined we included a provisional 1079 million net tax expense related to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 

during 2018 due to additional analysis changes in interpretations and in our assumptions and the issuance of additional regulatory guidance we made a 02 million adjustment to the provisional amount for taxes on deemed repatriated earnings and a 21 million adjustment related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as prescribed under sab 118 these adjustments were identified and recorded as discrete adjustments in the period in which such changes were made we completed our accounting for these provisional amounts during 2018 and we made no further adjustments to them during 2019 

health care reform 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the affordable care act was signed into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage statistics patient outcomes and patient satisfaction several legislative initiatives to repeal the affordable care act and adopt a form of replacement legislation were proposed but not adopted in 2017 however the tcja eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act which generally required most americans to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage as a result the level of insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the affordable care act is subject to increased uncertainty moreover on december 14 2018 the us district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid although the court stayed its ruling pending appeal the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act any court decision regarding the acts validity and generally the longerterm viability of the act is uncertain 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions in the past decade have had an adverse impact on market activities due to among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities although on a consolidated basis the consequences of economic conditions other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years while there generally has been some improvement in economic conditions recently the degree of improvement has been uneven among our regional markets and the continuation of economic trends of uncertain economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity 

in recent years hospitals in some regions of the us experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures consequently hospitals took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending despite recent improvements in the economic environment challenges persist particularly in some european countries as discussed below approximately 95 of our net revenues come from singleuse products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change conversely our sales volume could increase due to the greater number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered although as noted above the affordable 

care act may be subject to repeal a final court determination of invalidity further modification or replacement therefore the longerterm viability of the act is uncertain 

the economy in europe has weakened over the past year europe has seen a slowdown in external demand and a contraction in manufacturing which is starting to impact other parts of the economy while the solid performance of the labor market has helped to sustain private consumption and domestic demand gdp growth is expected to remain flat over the near term the economy in europe is not likely to rebound in the near term as international trade in goods remains relatively stagnant and the risks of an increase in trade tensions growing geopolitical conflicts and high uncertainties related to trade policies and the impact of brexit remain uncertain 

in asia we believe the economic outlook for the healthcare sector generally is positive however an ongoing slowdown in the chinese economy and us  china trade tensions as well as the public health epidemic relating to the novel coronavirus referred to as covid19 reported to have originated in wuhan china have increased uncertainties within asia in addition we continue to confront governmentimplemented price management and reimbursement controls particularly in australia china and india there continue to be government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market moreover many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements and as a result we expect longer costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries 

in latin america some highly regulated economies such as argentina brazil and mexico have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in reduced spending on necessary medical supplies and creating delays in the importation of medical devices although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors 

results of operations 

as used in this discussion new products are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months and “existing products” are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from any elimination of distributors either through acquisition or termination of the distributor from the sales channel 

certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis which may cause minor differences 

for a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2018 and 2017 refer to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 filed on february 21 2019 discussion of our reportable segment results of operations comparison for 2018 and 2017 is included below within this annual report on form 10k to reflect the changes in our segment presentation which occurred during the first quarter of 2019 

comparison of 2019 and 2018 

revenues 



net revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 increased 60 or 1470 million compared to the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to a 1428 million increase in sales volumes of existing products and to a lesser extent an increase in new product sales which were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 468 million 

gross profit 



for the year ended december 31 2019 gross margin increased 100 basis points or 18 compared to the prior year period the increase was primarily attributable to favorable product mix an increase in sales volumes of existing products and benefits from cost improvement initiatives partially offset by incremental tariffs and higher logistics and distribution costs 

selling general and administrative 



selling general and administrative expenses increased 557 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in selling and marketing expenses incurred to support higher sales and expenses incurred by our acquired businesses the increases were partially offset by favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

research and development 



the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to new product development costs for several of our product lines and european union medical device regulation eu mdr related costs 

restructuring and impairment charges 

anticipated charges and pretax savings related to restructuring programs and other similar cost savings initiatives 

we have ongoing restructuring programs primarily related to the consolidation of our manufacturing operations referred to as our 2019 2018 and 2014 footprint realignment plans we also have similar ongoing activities to relocate certain manufacturing operations within our oem segment the oem initiative that do not meet the criteria for a restructuring program under applicable accounting guidance nevertheless the activities should result in cost savings we expect only minimal costs to be incurred in connection with the oem initiative with respect to our currently ongoing restructuring programs and the oem initiative the table below summarizes charges incurred or estimated to be incurred and estimated annual pretax savings to be realized as follows 1 with respect to charges a the estimated total charges that will have been incurred once the restructuring programs and oem initiative are completed b the charges incurred through december 31 2019 and c the estimated charges to be incurred from january 1 2020 through the last anticipated completion date of the restructuring programs and oem initiative december 31 2026 and 2 with respect to estimated annual pretax savings a the estimated total annual pretax savings to be realized once the restructuring programs and oem initiative are completed b the estimated annual pretax savings realized based on the progress of the restructuring programs and oem initiative through december 31 2019 and c the estimated additional annual pretax savings to be realized from january 1 2020 through the last anticipated completion date of the restructuring programs and the oem initiative december 31 2026 

estimated charges and pretax savings are subject to change based on among other things the nature and timing of restructuring activities and similar activities changes in the scope of restructuring programs and the oem initiative unanticipated expenditures and other developments the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions the failure to realize anticipated savings from a supply contract related to a component included in certain kits sold by our americas segment and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pretax savings moreover estimated pretax savings constituting efficiencies with respect to increased costs that otherwise would have resulted from business acquisitions involve among other things assumptions regarding the cost structure and integration of businesses that previously were not administered by our management which are subject to a particularly high degree of risk and uncertainty it is likely that estimates of charges and pretax savings will change from time to time and the table below may reflect changes from amounts previously estimated in addition the table below does not include estimated charges and pretax savings related to substantially completed programs such as 

the 2017 vascular solutions integration program the 2017 emea program the 2016 footprint realignment plan and other 2016 restructuring programs which were substantially completed prior to or during 2019 additional details including estimated charges expected to be incurred in connection with our restructuring programs are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

pretax savings can also be affected by increases or decreases in sales volumes generated by the businesses impacted by the consolidation of manufacturing operations such variations in revenues can increase or decrease pretax savings generated by the consolidation of manufacturing operations for example an increase in sales volumes generated by the impacted businesses although likely to increase manufacturing costs may generate additional savings with respect to costs that otherwise would have been incurred if the manufacturing operations were not consolidated 



1 restructuring related charges represent costs that are directly related to the programs and principally constitute costs to transfer manufacturing operations to the new locations project management costs and accelerated depreciation as well as a charge associated with our exit from facilities that is expected to be imposed by the taxing authority in the affected jurisdiction most of these changes other than the tax charge are expected to be recognized in cost of goods sold 

2 substantially all of the pretax savings are expected to result in reductions to cost of goods sold 

the following discussion provides additional details with respect to our ongoing significant restructuring programs 

2019 footprint realignment plan 

in february 2019 we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations and related workforce reductions the “2019 footprint realignment plan these actions are expected to be substantially completed during 2022

we began realizing planrelated savings in 2018 and expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 25 million to 30 million once the plan is fully implemented 

2014 footprint realignment plan 

in april 2014 we initiated a restructuring plan the 2014 footprint realignment plan involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain highercost locations to existing lowercost locations we estimate that we will incur aggregate pretax charges in connection with the 2014 footprint realignment plan of 47 million to 52 million additionally we estimate that we will achieve annual pretax savings of 26 million to 29 million and we expect the plan will be substantially complete by the end of 2021

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends taxes scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which is provided for under the credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

of our 3011 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019 2314 million was held at nonus subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis 

on november 15 2019 we prepaid 250 million aggregate principle amount of our 2024 notes using available borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 

we have entered into crosscurrency swap agreements with different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate under the terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements we notionally exchanged in the aggregate 750 million for €6531 million the swap agreements which begin to expire in october 2023 are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements we and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement as a result we may be required to pay or be entitled to receive an amount equal to the difference on the expiration or earlier termination dates between the us dollar equivalent of the €6531 million notional amount and the 750 million notional amount if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has increased or declined by 10 from the rate in effect at the inception of these agreements we would receive from or be required to pay to the counterparties an aggregate of approximately 75 million in respect of the notional settlement the swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements however we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with different counterparties all of which are large wellestablished financial institutions 

on february 18 2020 we acquired iwg high performance conductors inc a privatelyheld original equipment manufacturer of minimally invasive medical products and high performance conductors for 260 million the acquisition which will complement our oem product portfolio was financed using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we may at any time from time to time repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions exchange transactions or otherwise at such price or prices as we deem appropriate such purchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 4371 million during 2019 and 4351 million during 2018 the 20 million increase was primarily attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by the net unfavorable impact of changes in working capital and contingent consideration payments of 261 million the unfavorable change in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to timing of collections and higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2019 and an increase in inventory purchases required to achieve desired safety stock levels and to support ongoing business growth 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 735 million during 2019 which included capital expenditures of 1027 million partially offset by proceeds from crosscurrency swap agreements designated as net investment hedges of 183 million and proceeds from sales of businesses and assets of 143 million

our noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions was 103 million and 107 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made as a result these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

our contingent consideration liabilities were 2199 million and 3042 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively of which 1481 million and 1369 million respectively were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration we expect most of the current portion to be paid during the first quarter 2020 as result of the achievement of certain sales milestones due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

see note 12 note 15 and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable after considering our historical collection experience the length of time an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 91 million and 93 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively which constituted 21 and 24 of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim distributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information when necessary we adjust the reserves with a corresponding adjustment to revenue to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect 

significant revisions to the estimated rebates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 216 million and 181 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31 2019 within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

inventory utilization 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

we review the net realizable value of inventory each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage 

longlived assets 

  

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for example such an assessment may be initiated if as a result of a change in expectations we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets include indefinitelived assets such as goodwill certain trade names and inprocess research and development iprd as well as finitelived intangibles such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives customer relationships intellectual property distribution rights and noncompetition agreements and are generally obtained through acquisition intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value and we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill 

the costs of finitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination and in the goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analyses including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic conditions and estimating future cash flows assumptions we use in our acquisition date fair value estimates and in our impairment evaluations include the discount rate and forecasted growth rates which are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans when applicable we believe these assumptions and estimates are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

goodwill 

  

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment during 2019 in conjunction with our segment change we determined it appropriate to aggregate certain north american reporting 

units because they were economically similar and as a result we have six reporting units no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2019 

in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test described below test described below alternatively we may test goodwill for impairment through the twostep quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value in performing the first step we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which we determine in the second step of the twostep test the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2019 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in the past several years 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting units carrying value to exceed its fair value while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline in this regard if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges moreover changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value in which case we also may incur material impairment charges 

other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative 

impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test 

in connection with intangible assets acquired in a business combination and the quantitative impairment tests since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value the fair value of trade names and iprd is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the value of the hypothetical royalty which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management must estimate the volume of sales hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar intangible assets are being licensed in the marketplace 

during the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we recognized impairment charges of 70 million and 169 million respectively related to our decision to abandon certain intellectual property intangible assets see restructuring and impairment charges within result of operations above as well as note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on these charges 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 



for additional information on assumptions pertaining to pension and other postretirement benefit plans refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

sharebased compensation 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant and recognize as expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option sharebased compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units is measured based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date discounted for the risk free interest rate and the present value 

of expected dividends over the vesting period share based compensation expense for 2019 and 2018 was 269 million and 224 million respectively 

contingent consideration liabilities 

  

in connection with an acquisition we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the neotract and essential medical acquisitions which represented most of our contingent consideration liabilities at december 31 2019 and 2018 using a monte carlo valuation approach which simulates future revenues during the earn outperiod using managements best estimates we determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using other probabilityweighted discounted cash flow analysis significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements decreases in these items may have the opposite effect increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements decreases may have the opposite effect see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities fair value within selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we accrued 2199 million and 3042 million of contingent consideration respectively 

income taxes 

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates the difficulties inherent in such assessments judgments and estimates are particularly challenging because we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions as a result we are at times subject to tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities management must among other things make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and nonus tax settlements changes in tax law and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1192 million and 1440 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and nonus tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred 

taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment we are currently under examination in germany the ultimate outcome of this examination could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions 

as noted above the tcja significantly changed us tax law as a result of the enactment of the tcja our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 included provisional amounts with respect to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year ended december 31 2018 as permitted by sab 118 we recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the tcja included in our december 31 2017 financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019 we made no adjustments to the provisional amounts see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

new accounting standards 

  

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards including estimated effects if any of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions 

we also are exposed to changes in the market trading price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates on december 31 2019 were determined using a base rate of the onemonth libor rate plus the applicable spread 



a change of 10 in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by 102 million based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2019 

foreign currency risk 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to foreign currency risks these risks include exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables as well as intercompany loans relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency and exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period our principal currency exposures relate to the euro chinese renminbi mexican peso canadian dollar malaysian ringgit czech koruna british pound australian dollar and south korean won we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts to attempt to minimize our exposure to these risks gains and losses on these contracts substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions 

as of december 31 2019 the total notional amount for the foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rates swap contracts expressed in us dollars was 2771 million and 7500 million respectively a sensitivity analysis of changes in fair value of these contracts outstanding as of december 31 2019 while not predictive in nature indicated that a hypothetical 10 increasedecrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increasedecrease the fair value of these contracts by 831 million the majority of which relates to the crosscurrency interest rate swap contracts 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the accounting treatment of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and crosscurrency interest rates swap contracts

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure a controls system cannot provide absolute assurance however that the objectives of the controls system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on page f2 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated by reference herein 

c change in internal control over financial reporting 

at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019 we integrated the enterprise resource planning or erp system used by our emea segment with our global erp system this conversion impacts certain interfaces with our customers and suppliers resulting in changes to the tools we use to take orders remit billings make payments and perform other business functions we believe that the expanded utilization of the erp system and related changes to processes and internal controls will enhance our internal control over financial reporting by improving the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes while providing us with the ability to scale our business 

other than the erp system upgrade discussed above no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 

business 

tableend teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we manufacture our products at approximately 35  manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the united states the us 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 

 our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to bring cost effective innovative products to market that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications as well as developing enhancements to and product line extensions of existing products during 2018  we introduced several product line extensions and 11  new products our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of class i and class ii medical devices most of which require 510k clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda for sale in the united states and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510k clearance we believe that 510k clearance or 510kexempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii medical devices see government regulation below for additional information 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

beginning in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our other businesses which served the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we became exclusively a medical device company 

we expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives 

recent acquisitions and distributortodirect sales conversions 

in 2017 we completed two large scale acquisitions neotract inc neotract and vascular solutions inc “vascular solutions” neotract was a medical device company that developed and commercialized the urolift system a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or bph vascular solutions was a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures 

during the past several years we have also completed a number of smaller acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions in several countries distributor to direct sales conversations generally involve the elimination of a distributor from the sales channel either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distribution relationship in some instances particularly in asia the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through subdistributors our distributor to direct sales conversions generally enable us to obtain improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel 

see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding recent acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions 

restructuring programs

latin america 

our latin america business generally engages in the same type of operations and serves the same type of end markets as the emea and asia segments 

our markets 

we generally serve three endmarkets hospitals and healthcare providers medical device manufacturers and home care these markets are affected by a number of factors including demographics utilization and reimbursement patterns the following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  derived from each of our end markets 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the us relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the united states 

all of our medical devices manufactured or sold in the united states are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” and its implementing regulations which are enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling storage record keeping clearance approval advertising and promotion distribution postmarket surveillance import and export of our medical devices 

unless an exemption or preamendment grandfather status applies each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance as a class i or class ii device by submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval as a class iii device by filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device a 510kcleared device preamendment device for which fda has not called for pmas or a device with a de novo authorization referred to as the predicate device substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process usually takes from four to nine months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process the process for granting marketing authorization when no substantially equivalent device exists if the fda agrees it is a low to moderate risk device a device not eligible for 510k clearance or de novo authorization is categorized as class iii and must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k or de novo process it generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i and class ii devices that require 510k clearance although a few are 510kexempt in addition modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k clearance or a de novo authorization the sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s investigational device exemption “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board irb which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve require modifications in or disapprove research to 

protect the rights safety and welfare of the human research subject the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients an irb may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or may impose other conditions 

a device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements those regulatory requirements include the following 

 the fda has issued final regulations regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which requires manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers while the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it has required us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements having taken effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2022 

certain of our medical devices are sold in convenience kits that include a drug component such as lidocaine these types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the center for devices and radiological health cdrh under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices “cgmps” to the extent applicable to the drugcomponent repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cgmps as well as other regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections to verify compliance with the qsr as well as other regulatory requirements such inspections are performed through the new medical device single audit program mdsap and other specified audits by regulatory authorities if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority under certain circumstances to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business manufacturing certification requirements and audits through the mdsap program also applies 

regulation of medical devices outside of the united states 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the united states in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems manufacturing certification requirements and audits through the mdsap program or other regulatory authority inspections also apply in addition the european union “eu” has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices as compared to the predecessor medical device directive including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently marketed medical devices will have until may 2020 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the eu and other regions that tie their product registrations to the eu requirements 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the united states targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the united states that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

we are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members effective january 2022 we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives the reported data is available to the public on the cms website failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the united state that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonunited states government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the united states we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the united states government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees distributors or other agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness our major competitors include medtronic plc becton dickinson and company and boston scientific corporation 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods based upon the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers however our ability to establish alternate sources of supply may be delayed due to fda and other regulatory authority requirements regarding the manufacture of our products volatility in commodity prices particularly with respect to aluminum steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide innovative new safe and effective products that enhance clinical value by reducing infections improving patient and clinician safety enhancing patient outcomes and enabling less invasive procedures 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products historically we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors 

employees 

we employed approximately 15200  fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2018  of these employees approximately 3800  were employed in the united states and 11400  in countries other than the united states approximately 11  of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collectivebargaining arrangements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

environmental 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the united states our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes while we continue to devote resources to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows further we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or stock price the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products due to among other things our inability to 



 in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly in some countries medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected in this regard we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations including reductions in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by discouraging customers’ selection of and reducing the prices they are willing to pay for our products 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors have implemented and are continuing to implement cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including facility consolidations organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce and we may engage in similar efforts in the future while we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we plan to upgrade the existing enterprise resource planning or erp system used by our emea segment to our global erp system in 2019 in connection with this upgrade we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect commercial activities such as our ability to receive and process orders and deliver products negatively impact customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of this initiative could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our united states revenues is derived from sales to distributors and “destocking” activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues in the united states is derived from sales to distributors who in turn sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions from time to time these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products a practice we refer to as “destocking” a distributors decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product distributor buying decisions including decisions to purchase competing products changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels economic conditions and other factors for example during the third quarter of 2016 we experienced a decline in purchases by our united states distributors that adversely affected our revenues and results of operations we believe the reduction resulted from the distributors expectations of a less severe 20162017 flu season which resulted in reduced levels of purchasing with respect to certain of our products that are used for treatment of hospitalized patients suffering from the flu following such instances of reduced purchases distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels nevertheless we cannot assure that distributors will in fact increase purchases of our products in this manner a decline in the level of product purchases by our united states distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern among other things the development design clearance approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k clearance or de novo authorization or approval of a premarket approval application or pma from the fda similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed in the european union a new medical device regulation was published in 2017 that when it enters into full force in 2020 will include significant additional pre and postmarket requirements   the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign government authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 



 we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated promoting a device for an offlabel use or making misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation which requires among other things periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation in addition any facilities assembling convenience kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

 if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals effective january 2022 we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician 

assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives the reported information is made publicly available in a searchable format in addition device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california connecticut nevada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims as well as product recalls any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death in addition in connection with the divestitures of our former nonmedical businesses we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to those businesses which include among other things liability for products manufactured prior to the date on which we completed the sale of the business product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the related legal defense costs may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by regulatory authorities to participate in a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could harm our reputation decrease demand for our products lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets   combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred several years ago led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending resulting in reductions delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services despite improvements in recent years particularly in the united states economic conditions continue to cause disruption in some financial markets resulting in among other things diminished liquidity and credit availability we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors the continuation in a number of markets of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

additionally our customers particularly in italy spain portugal and greece have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided which has increased our focus on collectability with respect to our accounts receivable from these customers to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional 

operating needs however the ongoing uncertainty in the european financial markets combined with a continuation of constrained european credit markets creates a risk that some of our european customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our aggregate net current and long term trade accounts receivable in italy spain portugal and greece were 390 million  and 491 million  respectively in 2018  2017  and 2016  net revenues from these countries were approximately 6  6  and 7  of total net revenues respectively and average days that accounts receivable from these countries were outstanding were 121  154  and 182  days respectively although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns moreover the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development marketing and other resources as well as significantly greater investments than we anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance as well as the shortterm effects of increased costs on results of operations although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with certain of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay on a quarterly basis we reassess these obligations and in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes we record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings which could have a material impact   on our results of operations as of december 31 2018  we accrued 3042 million  of contingent consideration most of which related to our acquisition of neotract in addition actual payments may differ materially from the amount of the contingent liability  which could have a material impact on our results of operations cash flows and liquidity for information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities see “critical accounting policies and estimates” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the united states pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the affordable care act 

 while as noted above the excise tax has been suspended through 2019 we may again be subject to the excise tax in 2020 unless the suspension is extended further we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in this regard several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the affordable care act were proposed but not adopted in 2017 however united states tax legislation adopted in december 2017 and commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tcja eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act and may have other effects moreover on december 14 2008 the united states district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid although the court stayed its ruling pending appeal the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act or any court decision regarding the acts validity is uncertain and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on the longerterm viability of the act or on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonunited states operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the united states including belgium the czech republic germany ireland malaysia and mexico in addition a significant portion of our nonunited states revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors as of december 31 2018  75  of our fulltime and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states and approximately 40  of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states in addition for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  approximately 41  42  and 46  respectively of our net revenues based on the teleflex entity generating the sale were derived from operations outside the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states including 



 in addition the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonunited states officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business similar antibribery laws are in effect in several foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded united states corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees distributors or other agents in addition we may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire violations of antibribery laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions as well as harm to our reputation 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in united states government contracts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates products manufactured in and sold into foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonunited states currencies to united states dollars our reporting currency as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates which we refer to as nonfunctional currencies a strengthening or weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro will affect our united states dollarreported revenue and income although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum and steel increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need in addition our borrowing costs have been adversely affected by recent interest rate increases and could be further affected if interest rates continue to increase any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

under our crosscurrency swap agreements a meaningful decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 

on october 4 2018 we entered into crosscurrency swap agreements with six different financial institutions to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate under the terms of the swap agreements we notionally exchanged 5000 million at an annual interest rate of 4625 for €4339 million at an annual interest rate of 1942 the swap agreements which expire on october 4 2023 require an exchange of the notional amounts between us and the counterparties upon expiration or earlier termination of the agreements if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro exchange rate has declined from the rate in effect on october 4 2018 we are required to pay the counterparties an amount equal to the excess of the us dollar value of €4339 million over 5000 million we and the counterparties have agreed to a net settlement with regard to the exchange of the notional amounts at the date of expiration or earlier termination of the agreements in the event of a significant decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate our payment obligations to the counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows in this regard if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro currency exchange rate has declined by 10 from the rate in effect at october 4 2018 at that date the exchange rate was 115 us dollar per euro we would be required to pay approximately 50 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement to the extent we enter into additional crosscurrency swap agreements a decline in the relevant exchange rates could further adversely affect our cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws including the impact of the enactment of the tcja any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to delays in product releases product shortages unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors including 

 our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our failure to maintain strong relationships with physicians and other health care professionals could adversely affect us 

we depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and as a result no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the united states we cannot assure that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop knowhow and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business 

we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations and employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and may involve significant legal expenses in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  we had total consolidated indebtedness of 22 billion  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

 if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

 we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities and taking other desirable corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 525 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes our 4875 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes and our 4625 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 notes and together with the 2024 notes the senior notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries collectively include limitations on our and their ability to among other things 

 in addition our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement a breach of any covenants under any one or more of our debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock which could lower the price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2018  we had outstanding approximately 460 million  shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 15 million  shares of our common stock of which approximately 11 million  were vested as of that date restricted stock units covering approximately 02 million  shares of our common stock which are expected to vest over the next three years performance stock units covering a maximum of 22290 shares of our common stock which may vest in early 2021 depending on our performance with regard to specified financial measures and market performance of our common stock compared to designated public companies and approximately 1767  shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan as of december 31 2018  36 million  shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore our issuance of shares following the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options as well as the vesting of restricted stock units and some or all of the performance stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and the issuance and sale in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders generate invoices collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise perform business functions our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and in some cases have caused significant harm although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur expenses lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

regulations related to conflict minerals have caused us to incur additional costs and may adversely affect our business 

in 2012 the sec promulgated rules under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and if so whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country in accordance with applicable regulations we have filed conflict minerals reports annually beginning in 2014 as discussed in these reports we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we have undertaken and continue to undertake efforts to identify where such minerals originated we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups due to among other things our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all moreover we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide products that are drc conflict free we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 11  of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings requirements under covenants in our debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our senior notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indentures governing the senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us if an acquisition event constitutes a “change of control” as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in the case of the 2027 notes the right will apply if the change in control is coupled with a ratings downgrade our obligations under the senior notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock

overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits improving patient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies 

we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives based on our evaluation we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives in addition we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position finally we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship in some instances particularly in asia the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through subdistributors our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel 

in may 2018 and february 2019 we initiated restructuring plans primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations and related workforce reductions the 2018 footprint realignment plan and the “2019 footprint realignment plan respectively the 2018 footprint realignment plan which also involves the outsourcing of certain european distribution operations and the 2019 footprint realignment plan are expected to be substantially completed during 2024 and 2022 respectively for additional information on both of these plans and a discussion of our other ongoing restructuring programs see  restructuring and impairment charges  under “results of operations” below 

we have continued to expand our presence within the medical device industry through strategic acquisitions during 2018 we completed several acquisitions of businesses that complement our interventional and surgical product portfolios the total fair value of the consideration transferred in connection with these acquisitions was 1723 million which included initial payments of 1176 million and contingent consideration having an estimated fair value of 547 million the contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of the companys obligations to make additional payments if certain sales and regulatory goals are met

us tax legislation 

us tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was enacted on december 22 2017 the legislation significantly changes united states or us tax law by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to 21 implementing a territorial tax system generally 

providing for among other things a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on undistributed post1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries which will be deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of us gaap in situations where a company does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tcja sab 118 states that in these circumstances if the company can determine a reasonable estimate for the income tax effects the sec staff would not object if the company includes in its financial statements the reasonable estimate it has determined and the sec staff also expressed its belief that it would not be appropriate for a company to exclude a reasonable estimate from its financial statements to the extent a reasonable estimate has been determined we included a provisional 1079 million net tax expense related to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 

during 2018 we made adjustments to the provisional amounts for taxes on deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to additional analysis changes in interpretations and in our assumptions and the issuance of additional regulatory guidance as prescribed under sab 118 these adjustments were identified and recorded as discrete adjustments in the period in which such changes were made during 2018 we recognized a net 23 million discrete tax benefit as a result of adjustments to the provisional tax impacts of the tcja included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 these adjustments included a 02 million reduction in the provisional tax on deemed repatriated earnings and a 21 million tax benefit from changes in our revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities we completed our accounting for these impacts during the fourth quarter 2018 

health care reform 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the affordable care act was signed into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage statistics patient outcomes and patient satisfaction several legislative initiatives to repeal the affordable care act and adopt a form of replacement legislation were proposed but not adopted in 2017 however the tcja eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act which generally required most americans to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage as a result the level of insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the affordable care act is subject to increased uncertainty moreover on december 14 2018 the united states district court for the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act is unconstitutional and the remainder of the act is invalid although the court stayed its ruling pending appeal the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act any court decision regarding the acts validity and generally the longerterm viability of the act is uncertain 

the affordable care act imposed a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices beginning in 2013 although the excise tax has been suspended through 2019 its status remains unclear for subsequent years 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions in the past decade have had an adverse impact on market activities due to among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities although on a consolidated basis the consequences of economic conditions other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years while there generally has been some improvement in economic conditions recently the degree of improvement has been uneven among our regional markets and the continuation of economic trends of uncertain economic growth constricted credit 

public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity 

in recent years hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures consequently hospitals took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending despite recent improvements in the economic environment challenges persist particularly in some european countries as discussed below approximately 95  of our net revenues come from singleuse products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change conversely our sales volume could increase due to the greater number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered although as noted above the affordable care act may be subject to repeal a final court determination of invalidity further modification or replacement therefore the longerterm viability of the act is uncertain 

a number of european countries continue to contend with considerable government debt annual deficits and high levels of unemployment despite some indications of a more positive economic outlook in europe the prospects for continued growth are uncertain and the healthcare sector remains weak in particular budgetary restraints among european countries have led to cost control measures such as delays in approvals for elective surgeriesthe public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which continues to result in delays in payments to us by customers in these countries moreover the impact of ongoing uncertainty regarding the impact of the departure of the united kingdom from the european union and political developments in european nations could have a profound economic effect in europe and elsewhere 

in asia we believe the economic outlook for the healthcare sector generally is positive however a deceleration of growth in the chinese economy and recent uschina trade tensions have increased uncertainties within asia in addition we continue to confront governmentimplemented price management and reimbursement controls particularly in china and india there also has been an increase in government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market moreover many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements and as a result we expect longer costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries 

in latin america some highly regulated economies such as argentina brazil and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors 

results of operations 

as used in this discussion new products are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months and “existing products” are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from any elimination of distributors either through acquisition or termination of the distributor from the sales channel

restructuring and impairment charges   

2019 footprint realignment plan 

in february 2019 we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations and related workforce reductions the “2019 footprint realignment plan these actions are expected to be substantially completed during 2022 

we estimate that we will incur aggregate pretax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2019 footprint realignment plan of 56 million to 70 million of which we expect 21 million to 26 million to be incurred in 2019 and most of the balance is expected to be incurred prior to the end of 2021 we estimate that 53 million to 66 million of these charges will result in cash outlays of which 8 million to 9 million is expected to be made in 2019 and most of the balance is expected to be made by the end of 2021 additionally we expect to incur 29 million to 35 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan of which 18 million to 22 million is expected to be incurred during 2019 and most of the balance is expected to be incurred by the end of 2021 

we expect to begin realizing planrelated savings in 2021 and expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 12 million to 14 million once the plan is fully implemented 

anticipated charges and pretax savings related to restructuring programs and other similar cost savings initiatives 

in addition to the 2019 footprint realignment plan we have ongoing restructuring programs related to i the integration of vascular solutions into teleflex ii the centralization of certain administrative functions in our emea segment iii the consolidation of our manufacturing operations referred to as our 2018 2016 and 2014 footprint realignment plans and iv other restructuring programs designed to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report in addition we have similar ongoing activities to relocate certain manufacturing operations within our oem segment the oem initiative that do not meet the criteria for a restructuring program under applicable accounting guidance but the activities should result in cost savings we expect only minimal costs to be incurred with respect to our restructuring programs and oem initiative the table below summarizes 1 the estimated total charges that will be incurred and the estimated annual pretax savings once the programs are completed 2 the charges incurred and estimated annual pretax savings realized through december 31 2018 and 3 the estimated charges to be incurred and the estimated incremental annual pretax savings to be realized for these programs and oem initiative through december 31 2018 and from january 1 2019 through their respective anticipated completion dates as used in the table pretax savings include 1 anticipated cost savings with respect to our historical expense items and 2 anticipated efficiencies to be realized with respect to costs that otherwise would have resulted from business acquisitions 

estimated charges and pretax savings are subject to change based on among other things the nature and timing of restructuring activities and similar activities changes in the scope of restructuring programs and the oem initiative unanticipated expenditures and other developments the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions failure to realize anticipated savings from a supply contract related to a component included in certain kits sold by our vascular 

north america and anesthesia north america segments and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pretax savings moreover estimated pretax savings constituting efficiencies with respect to increased costs that otherwise would have resulted from business acquisitions involve among other things assumptions regarding the cost structure and integration of businesses that previously were not administered by our management which are subject to a particularly high degree of risk and uncertainty it is likely that estimates of charges and pretax savings will change from time to time and the table below reflects changes from amounts previously estimated in addition the table below does not include estimated charges and pretax savings related to completed programs 

pretax savings can also be affected by increases or decreases in sales volumes generated by the businesses impacted by the consolidation of manufacturing operations such variations in revenues can increase or decrease pretax savings generated by the consolidation of manufacturing operations for example an increase in sales volumes generated by the impacted businesses although likely increasing manufacturing costs may generate additional savings with respect to costs that otherwise would have been incurred if the manufacturing operations were not consolidated 



 the following discussion provides additional details with respect to our restructuring programs for which we incurred restructuring charges in 2018 

2018 footprint realignment plan 

on may 1 2018 we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain european manufacturing operations to existing lowercost locations the outsourcing of certain european distribution operations and related workforce reductions these actions commenced in the second quarter 2018 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024

 interest expense   



comparison of 2018 and 2017

operating profit for the other businesses for the year ended december 31 2017 decreased 153 million or 579 compared to the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to higher operating expenses resulting from the neotract acquisition including transaction fees and related expenses which were partially offset by gross profit generated by the neotract acquisition 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends taxes scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which is provided for under the credit agreement and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

of our 3572 million  of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018  2992 million  was held at nonunited states subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis 

the tcja significantly changes us tax law by among other things imposing a onetime repatriation tax on undistributed post1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries previously we were not taxed on foreign earnings deemed to be permanently invested overseas under the tcja we will have to pay 1538 million over eight years for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings regardless of whether such earnings are actually repatriated of which we paid 126 million during 2018 see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information as a result of the repatriation tax provisions of the tcja we anticipate that generally we will be able to access cash located at our foreign subsidiaries without incurring any additional us federal income tax liabilities we are not aware of any other restrictions on repatriation of these funds and subject to cash payment of additional foreign withholding taxes these funds could be repatriated if necessary 

we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs however as discussed above in global economic conditions although there have been recent improvements in certain countries global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity consequently we continue to monitor our credit risk particularly with respect to customers in greece italy portugal and spain as well as consider other risk mitigation strategies in december 2018 we sold 127 million of receivables payable from publicly funded hospitals in italy and portugal for 126 million 

 as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our net trade accounts receivable from publicly funded hospitals in greece italy portugal and spain were 136 million  and 247 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately 6  6  and 7  respectively of our total net revenues and average days that current and longterm trade accounts receivable with respect to these customers were outstanding were 121  154  and 182  days respectively as of december 31 2018  and 2017  net current and longterm trade accounts receivable from these countries were approximately 11  and 15  respectively of our consolidated net current and longterm trade accounts receivable if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries moreover if global economic conditions generally deteriorate we may experience further delays in customer payments reductions in our customers’ purchases and higher credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2019 and future years see critical accounting policies and estimates below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable 

on october 4 2018 we executed crosscurrency swap agreements with six financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate under the terms of the swap agreements we notionally exchanged 500 million at an interest rate of 4625 for €4339 million at an interest rate of 1942 the swap agreements which expire on october 4 2023 are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements we and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement as a result we may be required to pay or be entitled to receive an amount equal to the difference on the expiration or earlier termination date between the us dollar equivalent of the €4339 million notional amount and the 500 million notional amount if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro currency exchange rate has declined by 10 from the rate in effect on october 4 2018 at that date the exchange rate was 115 us dollar per euro we would be required to pay to the counterparties an aggregate of approximately 50 million in respect of the notional settlement the swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements however we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with six different counterparties all of whom are large wellestablished financial institutions based on the us dollar to euro currency exchange rate in effect on october 4 2018 and assuming exchange rates remain constant throughout the five year term of the swap agreements we would realize a reduction in annual cash interest paid of 134 million 

we may at any time from time to time repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions exchange transactions or otherwise at such price or prices as we deem appropriate such purchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time

cash flows 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 



comparison of 2018  and 2017 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 4351 million  during 2018 and 4263 million  during 2017 the 88 million  increase is attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2018 as compared to 2017 and a net unfavorable impact of changes in working capital the net unfavorable impact from changes in working capital was due a net increase in inventories and a net increase in accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities 

the increase in inventories for 2018 was 372 million compared to an increase of 224 million for 2017 the net increase in inventories is attributable to higher inventory purchases associated with ongoing business growth primarily within our interventional urology business the increase in accounts receivable for 2018 was 234 million compared to an increase of 110 million for 2017 the net increase in accounts receivable is attributable to higher net revenues during 2018 and a decrease in receivables outstanding sold during 2018 as compared to 2017 in december 2018 we sold 127 million of receivables outstanding with publicly funded hospitals in italy and portugal compared to 2017 when we sold 161 million of outstanding receivables related to public hospitals in italy the increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities for 2018 was 634 million compared to an increase of 390 million for 2017 the increase is attributable to increased restructuring activity primarily related to the 2018 footprint realignment plan partially offset by lower payroll related accruals 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 1964 million  during 2018 which includes a cash outflow for payments related to the acquisition of businesses and intangible assets of 1210 million and capital expenditures of 808 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities from continuing operations was 2064 million  during 2018 which includes borrowing repayments of 1285 million contingent consideration payments of 732 million and dividend payments of 622 million partially offset by proceeds from new borrowings of 350 million and share based compensation and related tax benefits of 227 million 

comparison of 2017  and 2016 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 4263 million during 2017 and 4106 million during 2016 the 157 million increase is attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by a net cash outflow for income taxes resulting primarily from a tax refund received in 2016 excluding income taxes the net impact of the working capital changes was consistent in 2017 as compared to 2016 an increase in inventories was 

offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and to a lesser extent a net decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets the increase in inventories for the year ended december 31 2017 was 224 million compared to a decrease of 64 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase is attributable to inventory purchases to achieve desired safety stock levels as well as inventory from a former chinese distributor that was returned to us during 2017 in connection with the settlement of an arbitration proceeding between the distributor and us the net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was 390 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to an increase of 154 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and benefit related accruals 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 18 billion during 2017 primarily resulting from 18 billion in payments for businesses acquired principally vascular solutions and neotract and capital expenditures of 709 million which were partially offset by proceeds of 63 million from the sale of two properties one of which was a building that had been previously classified as held for sale 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was 11 billion during 2017 primarily resulting from a net increase in borrowings of 12 billion our borrowings under the credit agreement included 10 billion to finance the vascular solutions acquisition together with related fees and expenses and 725 million to finance the neotract acquisition in addition we sold 500 million in principal amount of our 4625 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 notes these increases were partially offset by our repayments of 11 billion of borrowings under the credit agreement additionally we had a 1361 million reduction in borrowings under the convertible notes resulting from exchange transactions and payment upon maturity of all remaining convertible notes outstanding 

net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was also impacted by dividend payments of 612 million and debt issuance and amendment fees of 267 million which included fees paid in connection with our entry into the credit agreement the issuance of the 2027 notes and a bridge facility and backstop commitment that was put in place to assist with the financing of the vascular solutions acquisition but was never utilized because the required financing was provided under the credit agreement 

financing arrangements 

  

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 



fixed rate debt comprised 528  and 507  of total debt at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the increase in fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings as of december 31 2018 compared to the fixed rate borrowings as of december 31 2017 is due a decrease in outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility resulting from debt repayments 

senior credit facility 

on january 20 2017 we amended and restated our thenexisting senior credit agreement by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement the “credit agreement” the credit agreement provides for a fiveyear revolving credit facility of 10 billion and a term loan facility of 7500 million the term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance the acquisitions of vascular solutions and subsequently neotract as described above the obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed subject to certain exceptions and limitations by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and each guarantors owned assets the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility will mature on january 20 2022 and february 17 2022 respectively at december 31 2018  we had 2930 million  in borrowings outstanding and approximately 21 million  in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 10 billion revolving credit facility 

the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that among other things and subject to certain exceptions place limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness create additional liens enter into a merger consolidation or amalgamation dispose of certain assets make certain investments or acquisitions pay dividends or make other restricted payments enter into swap agreements or enter into transactions with affiliates additionally the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio generally consolidated total funded indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement on the determination date to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination of not more than 450 to 1 a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio generally consolidated senior secured funded indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement on the date of determination to consolidated ebitda for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination of not more than 350 to 1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda for the four most recent quarters ending on or preceding the date of determination to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement paid in cash for such period of not less than 350 to 1 as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants of our senior credit facility 

see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the credit agreement 

2024 2026 and 2027 senior notes 

as of december 31 2018  the outstanding principal amount of our 525 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes our 4875 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes and the 2027 notes collectively the senior notes was 2500 4000 million and 5000 million respectively the indentures governing the 2024 notes and 2026 notes contain covenants that among other things and subject to certain exceptions limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock or other disqualified stock create liens merge consolidate or dispose of certain assets pay dividends make investments or make other restricted payments or enter into transactions with our affiliates the indenture governing the 2027 notes contains covenants that among other things and subject to certain exceptions limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets and enter into sale leaseback transactions the obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our existing and future 100 owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the credit agreement and by certain of our other 100 owned domestic subsidiaries as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior notes 

accounts receivable securitization 

we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 500 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2018  and 2017 we borrowed the maximum amount available of 500 million  under this facility this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness see note 9  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

contractual obligations   

contractual obligations at december 31 2018  are as follows 



 

we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 107 million  and 123 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made as a result these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of 3042 million  and 2721 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively of which 1369 million  and 742 million respectively were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration we expect most of the current portion to be paid during the first quarter 2019 as result of the achievement of certain sales and regulatory goals due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

see note 11  note 14  and note 15  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions 

  

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform 

ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable after considering the companys historical collection experience the length of time an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 93 million  and 103 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively which constituted 24  and 28  of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

in light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years we have procedures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customerbycustomer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts these procedures include monthly credit control committee meetings at which customer credit risks are identified after review of among other things accounts that exceed specified credit limits payment delinquencies and other customer issues in addition with respect to government customers we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices to reduce risk exposures with respect to certain of our nongovernment customers we have instituted procedures that include reducing credit limits and requiring that payments accompany orders some of our customers particularly in greece italy spain and portugal have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain additional allowances may be required in future periods 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

  

we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim distributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information when necessary we adjust the reserves with a corresponding adjustment to revenue to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions to the estimated rebates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 181 million  and 122 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31 2018  within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

inventory utilization 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability the reduction in carrying value is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

the adequacy of the reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage 

our inventory reserve was 349 million  and 356 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively which represents 75  and 83 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

longlived assets 

  

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for example such an assessment may be initiated if as a result of a change in expectations we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets include indefinitelived assets such as goodwill certain trade names and inprocess research and development iprd as well as finitelived intangibles such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives customer relationships intellectual property distribution rights and noncompetition agreements and are generally obtained through acquisition intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value and we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill 

the costs of finitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination and in the goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analyses including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic conditions and estimating future cash flows assumptions we use in our acquisition date fair value estimates and in our impairment evaluations include the discount rate and forecasted growth rates which are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans when applicable we believe these assumptions and estimates are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

goodwill 

  

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment we have ten reporting units in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test described below alternatively we may test goodwill for impairment through the twostep quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis under guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be simplified effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 subject to optional early adoption see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value in performing the first step we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods one 

which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which we determine in the second step of the twostep test the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2018  as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in the past several years 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting units carrying value to exceed its fair value while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline in this regard if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges moreover changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value in which case we also may incur material impairment charges 

no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2018 

other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test 

in connection with intangible assets acquired in a business combination and the quantitative impairment tests since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value the fair value of trade names and iprd is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the value of the hypothetical royalty which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset 

management must estimate the volume of sales hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar intangible assets are being licensed in the marketplace 

during the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized a 169 million  pretax 86 million after tax impairment charge related to the abandonment of certain intellectual property intangible assets there were no impairment charges recorded for the year ended december 31 2017 for the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized a pretax iprd impairment charge of 410 million see restructuring and impairment charges within result of operations above as well as note 5  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on these charges 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 



for additional information on assumptions pertaining to pension and other postretirement benefit plans refer to note 15  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

sharebased compensation 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant and recognize as expense the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option sharebased compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units is measured based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date discounted for the risk free interest rate and the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period share based compensation expense for 2018  2017  and 2016  was 224 million  194 million  and 169 million  respectively 

contingent consideration liabilities 

  

in connection with an acquisition we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the neotract acquisition and to our acquisition in october 2018 of essential medical inc which 

represented most of our contingent consideration liabilities at december 31 2018 using a monte carlo valuation approach which simulates future revenues during the earn outperiod using managements best estimates see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding these acquisitions we determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow analysis significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements decreases in these items may have the opposite effect increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements decreases may have the opposite effect see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities fair value within selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we accrued 3042 million  and 2721 million  of contingent consideration respectively 

income taxes 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates the difficulties inherent in such assessments judgments and estimates are particularly challenging because we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions as a result we are at times subject to tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities management must among other things make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final united states and foreign tax settlements changes in tax law and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1440 million and 1048 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment we are currently under examination in germany the ultimate outcome of this examination could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions 

as noted above the tcja significantly changes us tax law as a result of the enactment of the tcja our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 included provisional amounts with respect to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018 as permitted by sab 118 we recorded 

adjustments to the provisional amounts related to the tcja included in our december 31 2017 financial statements see note 14  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards including estimated effects if any of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates on december 31 2018  were determined using a base rate of the onemonth libor rate plus the applicable spread 



a change of 10 in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by 103 million  based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2018  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 

forward currency contracts 

we enter into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge the risk associated with these foreign currency exposures these contracts generally involve the purchase or sale at designated future dates of specified amounts of a foreign currency while simultaneously committing to an opposite way sale or purchase of a specified amount of us dollars or euros based on the exchange rate at the time of entry into the contract the contracts we enter into to hedge transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies are designated as cash flow hedges the contracts to hedge monetary asset and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the accounting treatment of designated and nondesignated hedge contracts 

the following table provides information regarding our open foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2018  which mature during 2019  as of december 31 2018  the total notional amount for the designated and nondesignated contracts expressed in us dollars is 1153 million  and 1259 million  respectively as of december 31 2017  the total notional amount for the designated and nondesignated contracts expressed in us dollars is 885 million  and 1106 million  respectively forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies 



crosscurrency swap agreements 

on october 4 2018 we entered into crosscurrency swap agreements with six different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate under the terms of the swap agreements we notionally exchanged 5000 million at an annual interest rate of 4625 for €4339 million at an annual interest rate of 1942 the swap agreements which expire on october 4 2023 are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or earlier termination of the agreements we and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement 

the interest component of the swap agreements will affect the interest expense recognized within our statement of operations based on the us dollar to euro currency exchange rate in effect on october 4 2018 and assuming the exchange rates remain constant throughout the five year term of the crosscurrency swap agreements we would realize an annual pretax net benefit ie a reduction in interest expense as a result of the swap agreements of 134 million or a total of 670 million over the five year term of the swap agreements a 10 increase or decrease in the us dollar to euro currency exchange rate in effect on october 4 2018 would result in a change to the annual pretax net benefit of approximately 10 million 

as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance in august 2017 with the objective of improving the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entitys risk management activities in its financial statements as a result of our early adoption of the fasb guidance and because the swap agreements are designated as net investment hedges changes in the fair value of the crosscurrency swap agreements will be recognized as a component of “foreign currency translation continuing operations adjustments net of tax” within “other comprehensive loss income net of tax” in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in this regard a favorable foreign currency change in the designated investment value of our foreign subsidiaries that use euros as their functional currency generally will be offset by an unfavorable foreign currency change in the swap agreements and vice versa  at october 4 2018 a 10 fluctuation in the us dollar to euro currency exchange rate would have an approximately 50 million impact on the fair value of the notional amount of the crosscurrency swap agreements and an offsetting 50 million impact on the designated net investment value of the foreign subsidiaries in addition in the event of a significant decline in the us dollar to euro exchange rate our payment obligations to the 

counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows in this regard if at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements the us dollar to euro currency exchange rate has declined by 10 from the rate in effect at october 4 2018 we would be required to pay approximately 50 million to the counterparties 

the swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements however we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with six different counterparties all of whom are large wellestablished financial institutions 

in the future we may enter into additional crosscurrency swap agreements to further hedge against the effect of variability in the us dollar to euro exchange rate although there can be no assurances that we will do so

business 

tableend teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we manufacture our products at approximately 35  manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the united states the us 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 

 our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to bring cost effective innovative products to market that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications as well as enhancements to and product line extensions of existing products during 2017  we introduced several product line extensions and 10  new products our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of class i and class ii devices most of which require 510k clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda for sale in the united states and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510k clearance we believe that 510k clearance or 510kexempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii devices see government regulation below 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

beginning in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our other businesses which served the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we became exclusively a medical device company 

we expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives 

recent acquisitions 

on february 17 2017 we acquired vascular solutions inc vascular solutions a medical device company that has developed and marketed products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures the aggregate consideration that we paid to acquire vascular solutions was 9755 million effective in the fourth quarter 2017 vascular solutions financial information is primarily presented within the interventional north america reportable operating segment see our segments below 

on october 2 2017 we acquired neotract inc neotract a medical device company that has developed and commercialized the urolift system a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or bph the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire neotract was 9752 million  which included initial payments of 7256 million in cash less a favorable working capital adjustment of 14 million for which we had not yet received payment as of december 31 2017 and 2510 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration the contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of up to 375 million we would be required to pay if specified net sales goals through the end of 2020 are achieved in connection with this acquisition we created a new operating segment entitled interventional urology north america which is included within the all other category in the presentation of segment information 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

distributortodirect sales conversions and restructuring programs 

during the past several years we have completed a number of distributor to direct sales conversions in several countries these transactions generally involve the elimination of a distributor from the sales channel either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distribution relationship in some instances particularly in asia the conversion involves the acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through third party subdistributors or through new distributors in 2017 certain european countries were converted from distributor sales to direct sales in connection with our elimination of former vascular solutions distributors also during 2017 we commenced a distributor to direct sales conversion in china as a result of our decision to eliminate a key distributor within that sales channel see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  segment results  comparison of 2017 and 2016  asia for further information regarding this initiative the distributor to direct sales conversions generally enable us to obtain improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel additionally we continue to execute restructuring programs to improve efficiencies in our sales and marketing and research and development organizations and in our manufacturing and distribution facilities 

our segments 

following our acquisition of vascular solutions we commenced an integration program under which we are combining the vascular solutions business with certain of our legacy businesses specifically we are combining vascular solutions north american business with our interventional access business which formerly was part of the vascular north america operating segment and our cardiac business which formerly was a separate operating segment included in the all other category for purposes of segment reporting these businesses are now in our interventional north america segment additionally we are combining the vascular solutions businesses in europe asia and latin america with our legacy businesses in the respective locations and these vascular solutions businesses are now part of our emea europe middle east and africa asia and latin america operating segments respectively the changes in our operating segments which became effective in the fourth quarter 2017 also reflect the manner in which our new chief operating decision maker assesses business performance and allocation of resources

our markets 

we generally serve three endmarkets hospitals and healthcare providers medical device manufacturers and home care these markets are affected by a number of factors including demographics utilization and reimbursement patterns the following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  derived from each of our end markets 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the us relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the united states 

all of our medical devices manufactured or sold in the united states are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” and its implementing regulations which are enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling storage record keeping clearance approval advertising and promotion distribution postmarket surveillance import and export of our medical devices 

unless an exemption or preamendment grandfather status applies each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance as a class i or class ii device by submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval as a class iii device by filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed 510kcleared device or preamendment device for which fda has not called for pmas referred to as the predicate device substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process the process for approval when no substantially equivalent device exists if the fda agrees it is a low to moderate risk device a device not eligible for 510k clearance or de novo clearance is categorized as class iii and must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k process it generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i and class ii devices that require 510k clearance although a few are 510k exempt in addition modifications made to devices after they receive clearance 

or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k clearance the sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s investigational device exemption “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board irb which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve require modifications in or disapprove research to protect the rights safety and welfare of the human research subject the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients an irb may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or may impose other conditions 

a device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements those regulatory requirements include the following 

 the fda has issued final regulations regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which requires manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers while the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it has required us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements having taken effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2020 

certain of our medical devices are sold in convenience kits that include a drug component such as lidocaine these types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the center for devices and radiological health or cdrh under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices “cgmps” to the extent applicable to the drugcomponent repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cgmps as well as other regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections to verify compliance with the qsr as well as other regulatory requirements if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority under certain circumstances to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

regulation of medical devices outside of the united states 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the united states in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the united states targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the united states that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

we are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members the reported data is available to the public on the cms website failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the united state that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonunited states government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the united states we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the united states government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees distributors or other agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness our major competitors include medtronic plc and becton dickinson and company 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods based upon the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity prices particularly with respect to aluminum steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and our efforts to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures our research and development expenditures were 848 million  586 million  and 521 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products historically we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors 

employees 

we employed approximately 14400  fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2017  of these employees approximately 3600  were employed in the united states and 10800  in countries other than the united states approximately 10  of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collectivebargaining arrangements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

environmental 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the united states our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes while we continue to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows further we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or stock price the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products due to among other things our inability to 



 in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly in some countries medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected in this regard we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations including reductions in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by discouraging customers’ selection of our products and reducing the prices they are willing to pay 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including facility consolidations organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce and we may engage in similar efforts in the future while we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our other strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning or erp systems to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives however as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our united states revenues is derived from sales to distributors and “destocking” activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues in the united states is derived from sales to distributors who in turn sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions from time to time these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products a practice we refer to as “destocking” a distributors decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product distributor buying decisions including decisions to purchase competing products changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels economic conditions and other factors for example during the third quarter of 2016 we experienced a decline in purchases by our united states distributors that adversely affected our revenues and results of operations we believe the reduction resulted from the distributors expectations of a less severe 20162017 flu season which resulted in reduced levels of purchasing with respect to certain of our products that are used for treatment of hospitalized patients suffering from the flu following such instances of reduced purchases distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels nevertheless we cannot assure that distributors will in fact increase purchases of our products in this manner a decline in the level of product purchases by our united states distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern among other things the development design approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k or de novo clearance or approval of a premarket approval application or pma from the fda similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign government authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 



 we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated promoting a device for an offlabel use or making misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation which requires periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation in addition any facilities assembling convenience kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

 if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals the reported information is made publicly available in a searchable format in addition device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer 

of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california connecticut nevada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims as well as product recalls any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death in addition in connection with the divestitures of our former nonmedical businesses we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to those businesses which include among other things liability for products manufactured prior to the date on which we completed the sale of the business product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the related legal defense costs may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by regulatory authorities to participate in a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could harm our reputation decrease demand for our products lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets   combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred in recent years led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending resulting in reductions delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services despite some improvements in recent years economic conditions continue to cause disruption in some financial markets resulting in among other things diminished liquidity and credit availability we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors the continuation of the present broadly applicable economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

additionally our customers particularly in italy spain portugal and greece have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided which has increased our focus on collectability with respect to our accounts receivable from these customers to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional operating needs however the ongoing uncertainty in the european financial markets combined with a continuation of constrained european credit markets creates a risk that some of our european customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our aggregate net current and long term trade accounts receivable in italy spain portugal and greece were 491 million  and 511 million  respectively in 2017  2016  and 

2015  net revenues from these countries were approximately 6  7  and 7  of total net revenues respectively and average days that accounts receivable from these countries were outstanding were 154  182  and 204  days respectively although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income and may have material impacts on our operating results 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns moreover the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development marketing and other resources as well as significantly greater investments than we anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance as well as the shortterm effects of increased costs on results of operations although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with certain of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay as of december 31 2017  we accrued 2721 million  of contingent consideration of which the vast majority related to our acquisition of neotract on a quarterly basis we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings which could have a material impact   on our results of operations in addition actual payments may differ materially from the amount of the contingent liability we have recorded which could have a material impact on our cash flows and liquidity for information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities see “critical accounting policies and estimates” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the united states pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the affordable care act 

 in 2015  we recorded an expense of 102 million  with respect to the medical device excise tax while as noted above the excise tax has been suspended through 2019we will again be subject to the excise tax in 2020 unless the suspension is extended further we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in this regard several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the affordable care act were proposed but not adopted in 2017 however the recently adopted tax cuts and jobs act eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act and may have other effects the longerterm viability of or the nature of any modification of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act is highly uncertain and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonunited states operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the united states including belgium the czech republic germany ireland malaysia and mexico in addition a significant portion of our nonunited states revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors as of december 31 2017  75  of our fulltime and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states and approximately 45  of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states in addition for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  approximately 42  46  and 47  respectively of our net revenues based on the teleflex entity generating the sale were derived from operations outside the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states including 

 in addition the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonunited states jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper 

payments to nonunited states officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded united states corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees distributors or other agents in addition we may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire violations of antibribery laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions as well as harm to our reputation 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in united states government contracts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates products manufactured in and sold into foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonunited states currencies to united states dollars our reporting currency as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates which we refer to as nonfunctional currencies a strengthening or weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro will affect our united states dollarreported revenue and income although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum and steel increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need in addition our borrowing costs could be adversely affected if interest rates increase any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws including the impact of recently enacted united states tax legislation as discussed immediately below any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was enacted on december 22 2017 the tcja permanently reduces the united states corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to 21 puts into effect a territorial tax system generally providing for among other things a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met imposes a onetime repatriation tax on undistributed post1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries which are deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax and creates modifies or repeals many other statutory and regulatory provisions our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 include provisional amounts with respect to the deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities while we believe that the provisional amounts constitute reasonable estimates we continue to examine the impact the tcja may have on our business once our accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja is complete the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the tcja may differ from the provisional amounts possibly materially due to among other things additional analysis changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the tcja 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortages unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors including 



our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

we depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and as a result no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the united states we cannot assure that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop knowhow and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business 

we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  we had total consolidated indebtedness of 23 billion  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

 if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

 we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 525 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes our 4875 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes and our 4625 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 notes and together with the 2024 notes the senior notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to among other things 

 in addition our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement a breach of any covenants under any one or 

more of our debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

the warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may adversely affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with the issuance of our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with two counterparties which we refer to as the hedge counterparties the hedge transactions involved the issuance to us of call options that covered the number of shares of our common stock underlying the convertible notes the call options were designed to reduce the dilution with respect to our common stock we were required to issue andor cash payments we were required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties under which we have issued shares of our common stock and very likely will be obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock on various warrant expiration dates that occur through august 31 2018 at an exercise price of 7465 subject to customary antidilution adjustments when convertible notes were converted in accordance with their terms the hedge transactions were effected through our exercise of call options when we purchased convertible notes from the holders in exchange for cash and our common stock the call options with respect to shares underlying those convertible notes were canceled and the number of outstanding warrants was reduced following the maturity of the convertible notes on august 1 2017 no further call options were outstanding and warrants to purchase 724648 shares of our common stock remained outstanding subsequent warrant exercises have had and based on recent market prices of our common stock will continue to have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock between november 1 2017 and december 31 2017 warrants to purchase 165034 shares were exercised and after retaining 43251 shares to cover payment of the exercise price and paying cash in lieu of fractional shares we delivered 105638 shares to the hedge counterparties as of december 31 2017 warrants to purchase 559614 shares of our common stock remained outstanding if we so elect in lieu of delivering our common stock upon exercise of the warrants we may make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants in addition under applicable accounting guidance changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation with respect to the warrants which in turn could impact our reported financial results based on the average market price of our common stock during 2017  05 million  shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants were included in the total diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2017  for additional information see “financing arrangements” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k 

in connection with establishing their positions under the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates entered into various cashsettled overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the convertible notes the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates may in their sole discretion with or without notice modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock which could lower the price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2017  we had outstanding approximately 452 million  shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 17 million  shares of our common stock of which approximately 12 million  were vested as of that date restricted stock units covering approximately 02 million  shares of our common stock which are expected to vest over the next three years and approximately 9600  shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan as of december 31 2017  45 million  shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore our issuance of shares following the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options and warrants as well as the vesting of restricted stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock including common stock issued as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants and vesting of restricted stock units could depress the price of our common stock 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders generate invoices collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and in some cases have caused significant harm although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur expenses lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business 

in 2012 the sec promulgated rules under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and if so whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country in accordance with applicable regulations we have filed conflict minerals reports annually beginning in 2014 as discussed in these reports we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we have undertaken and continue to undertake efforts to identify where such minerals originated we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups due to among other things our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all moreover we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide products that are drc conflict free we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 



 these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 10  of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings requirements under covenants in our debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our senior notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the indentures governing the senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us if an acquisition event constitutes a “change of control” as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in the case of the 2027 notes the right will apply if the change in control is coupled with a ratings downgrade our obligations under the senior notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock

overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies 

we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives based on our evaluation we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives in addition we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position for a discussion of our ongoing restructuring programs see  restructuring and impairment charges  under “results of operations” below finally we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship in some instances particularly in asia the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through subdistributors our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel 

on february 17 2017 we acquired vascular solutions inc “vascular solutions” a medical device company that developed and marketed clinical products for use in minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures for an aggregate purchase price of 9755 million the acquisition is expected to meaningfully accelerate the growth of our vascular and interventional access product portfolios by facilitating our further expansion into the coronary and peripheral vascular market and by generating increased crossportfolio selling opportunities to both our and vascular solutions customer bases we financed the acquisition through a combination of term loan and revolving credit borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement the credit agreement is described in more detail below under  borrowings  within liquidity and capital resources 

on october 2 2017 we completed the acquisition of neotract inc neotract a medical device company that developed and commercialized the urolift system a minimally invasive medical device for treating lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or bph the estimated fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire neotract was 9752 million  which included initial payments of 7256 million in cash less a favorable working capital adjustment of 14 million for which we had not yet received payment as of december 31 2017 and 2510 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration the contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of additional consideration of up to 375 million we would be required to pay if specified net sales goals through the end of 2020 are achieved the acquisition of neotract was financed with revolving credit borrowings under our credit agreement see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we also completed acquisitions related to our anesthesia and respiratory product portfolios and distributor to direct sales conversions the total fair value of the consideration related to these acquisitions was 801 million 

during 2016 we completed acquisitions of businesses that are included in our oem and asia reportable operating segments in addition during 2016 we acquired the remaining 26 ownership interest in an indian affiliate from the noncontrolling shareholders we already owned the 74 controlling interest the total fair value of the consideration paid in these transactions was 228 million 

change in reporting segments 

following our acquisition of vascular solutions we commenced an integration program under which we are combining vascular solutions businesses with certain of our legacy businesses specifically we are combining 

vascular solutions north american business with our interventional access business which formerly was part of our vascular north america operating segment and our cardiac business which formerly was a separate operating segment included in the all other category for purposes of segment reporting these businesses are now in our interventional north american segment additionally we are combining the vascular solutions businesses in europe asia and latin america with our legacy businesses in the respective locations and these vascular solutions businesses are now part of our emea europe middle east and africa asia and latin america operating segments respectively the changes in our operating segments which became effective in the fourth quarter 2017 also reflect the manner in which our new chief operating decision maker assesses business performance and allocation of resources 

as a result of the operating segment changes described above we have the following seven reportable segments vascular north america interventional north america anesthesia north america surgical north america emea asia and oem in connection with the presentation of segment information we will continue to present certain operating segments which now include interventional urology and respiratory north america as well as latin america in the “all other” category because they are not material all prior comparative periods presented in this report have been restated to reflect these changes additionally because these changes affected certain of our reporting units we reallocated the goodwill balances based on the relative fair values of the reporting units and performed goodwill impairment analyses on the affected reporting units we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses 

recently enacted us tax legislation 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was enacted on december 22 2017 the legislation significantly changes united states or us tax law by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35 to 21 implementing a territorial tax system generally providing for among other things a dividends received deduction on the foreign source portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation if specified conditions are met and imposing a onetime repatriation tax on undistributed post1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries which will be deemed repatriated for purposes of the tax 

on december 22 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of us gaap in situations where a company does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tcja sab 118 states that in these circumstances if the company can determine a reasonable estimate for the income tax effects the sec staff would not object if the company includes in its financial statements the reasonable estimate it has determined and the sec staff also expressed its belief that it would not be appropriate for a company to exclude a reasonable estimate from its financial statements to the extent a reasonable estimate has been determined we have included provisional amounts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 while we believe that the provisional amounts constitute reasonable estimates we continue to examine the impact the tcja may have on our business once our accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja is complete the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the tcja may differ from the provisional amounts possibly materially due to among other things additional analysis changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the tcja 

in 2017 we recognized a 1079 million net tax expense as a result of the tcja additional information on the impacts of the tcja is included below and in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

health care reform 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the affordable care act was signed into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage statistics patient outcomes and patient satisfaction several legislative initiatives to repeal the affordable care act and adopt a form of replacement legislation were proposed but not adopted in 2017 however the recently adopted tax cuts and jobs act eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act which generally required most americans to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage as a result the level of insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the affordable care act is subject to 

increased uncertainty the nature and effect of any modification of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act as well as the longerterm viability of the act is uncertain 

the affordable care act imposed a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices beginning in 2013 although the excise tax has been suspended through 2019 its status remains unclear for subsequent years for the year ended december 31 2015  we recorded medical device excise taxes of 102 million  which was included in selling general and administrative expenses 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions in the past decade have had adverse impacts on market activities due to among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities although on a consolidated basis the consequences of economic conditions other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years while there has been some degree of improvement in economic conditions recently the continuation of economic trends of uncertain economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity 

in recent years hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures consequently hospitals took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending despite recent improvements in the economic environment challenges persist particularly in some european countries as discussed below approximately 95  of our net revenues come from singleuse products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change conversely our sales volume could increase due to the greater number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered although as noted above the affordable care act may be subject to repeal further modification or replacement and its longerterm viability is uncertain 

a number of european countries continue to contend with considerable government debt annual deficits and high levels of unemployment despite some indications of a more positive economic outlook in europe the healthcare sector remains weak in particular budgetary restraints among european countries have led to cost control measures such as delays in approvals for elective surgeriesthe public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which continues to result in delays in payments to us by customers in these countries moreover the impact of brexit economic and trade policies of the trump administration and political developments in european nations could have a profound economic effect in europe and elsewhere 

in asia we are experiencing an increasing trend of governmentimplemented price management and reimbursement controls particularly in china and australia there also has been an increase in government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market moreover many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements and as a result we expect longer costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries 

in latin america some highly regulated economies such as argentina and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors 

results of operations 

as used in this discussion new products are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months and “existing products” are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months 

ago discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects for the first 12 months following the acquisition or termination of a distributor the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from the elimination of the distributor from the sales channel to the extent an acquired distributor had preacquisition sales of products other than ours the impact of the postacquisition sales of those products on our results of operations is included within our discussion of the impact of acquired businesses 

certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis which may cause minor differences 

revenues 



comparison of 2017   and 2016 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 increased 149  or 2783 million  compared to the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to net revenues of 2058 million generated by acquired businesses primarily vascular solutions and neotract and to a lesser extent an increase in new product sales 

comparison of 2016   and 2015 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 32  or 583 million  compared to the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes of existing products of 373 million and an increase in new product sales of 242 million both across all of our segments the increase was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

gross profit 



comparison of 2017 and 2016 

for the year ended december 31 2017 gross margin increased 130 basis points or 24  compared to the prior year the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to gross margin generated by acquired businesses a more favorable mix of products sold cost improvement initiatives including the 2016 and 2014 footprint realignment plans described below and the impact of price increases these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable 104 million impact of the stepup in carrying value of inventory recognized in connection with the vascular solutions acquisition that adversely affected cost of goods sold upon sale of such inventory during 2017 as well as higher logistics and distributions costs 

comparison of 2016   and 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2016 gross margin increased 110 basis points or 21 compared to the prior year the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in sales of higher margin products primarily in the anesthesia north america and emea segments as well as lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives including the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan 

selling general and administrative 



comparison of 2017 and 2016 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1367 million  during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to 1083 million in expenses related to acquired businesses and distributor to direct conversions the unfavorable impact of increases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

comparison of 2016 and 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 57 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the suspension of the excise tax on medical devices under the affordable care act of 102 million and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 27 million partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses of 75 million 

research and development 



comparison of 2017   and 2016 

the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 is primarily attributable to expenses incurred by acquired businesses primarily vascular solutions and to a lesser extent neotract additionally 2017 research and development expenses reflect increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments 

comparison of 2016   and 2015 

the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 is primarily attributable to increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments  

restructuring and impairment charges   

the following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our ongoing restructuring plans and programs as well as impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits 



 

anticipated charges and pretax savings related to restructuring plans and programs 

with respect to our restructuring plans and programs that were ongoing at december 31 2017 the table below summarizes 1 the estimated total charges that will be incurred and the estimated annual pretax savings once the plans and programs are completed 2 the charges incurred and estimated pretax savings realized through december 31 2017 and 3 the estimated charges to be incurred and the estimated incremental pretax savings to be realized for these plans and programs from january 1 2018 through their respective anticipated completion dates 

estimated charges and pretax savings are subject to change based on among other things the nature and timing of restructuring activities changes in the scope of restructuring plans and programs unanticipated expenditures and other developments the effect of additional acquisitions or dispositions and other factors that were not reflected in the assumptions made by management in previously estimating restructuring and restructuring related charges and estimated pretax savings moreover estimated pretax savings relating to programs involving the integration of acquired businesses are particularly difficult to forecast because the estimate of pretax savings to a considerable extent involves assumptions regarding operation of businesses during periods when those businesses were not administered by our management it is likely that estimates of charges and pretax savings will change from time to time and the table below reflects changes from amounts previously estimated in addition the table below has been updated to remove estimated charges and pretax savings related to completed programs estimated charges and pretax savings are described in more detail below within the discussions of the specific restructuring plans and programs 





incurred with respect to our current suppliers therefore we anticipate a net savings from the agreement which is reflected in the table above see “2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan” below for additional information 

 

the following provides additional details with respect to our ongoing restructuring plans and programs 

2017 vascular solutions integration program 

during the first quarter 2017 we committed to a restructuring program related to the integration of vascular solutions operations into our operations we initiated the program in the first quarter 2017 and expect the program to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter 2018 we estimate that we will record aggregate pretax restructuring charges of 65 million to 80 million related to this program as compared to the prior estimate of 60 million to 75 million we expect 55 million to 62 million of the total restructuring charges will constitute termination benefits and 10 million to 18 million will relate to other exit costs including employee relocation and outplacement costs additionally we expect to incur 25 million to 30 million of restructuring related charges consisting primarily of retention bonuses offered to certain employees expected to remain with our company after completion of the program all of these charges will result in future cash outlays we began realizing programrelated savings in the first quarter 2017 and expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 25 million to 30 million once the program is fully implemented this is an increase as compared to the prior estimate of 20 million to 25 million the increase in the estimated restructuring charges and annual pretax savings ranges as compared to the prior estimates were the result of an increase in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program 

2017 emea restructuring program 

during the first quarter 2017 we committed to a restructuring program to centralize certain administrative functions in europe the program commenced in the second quarter 2017 and is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018 we estimate that we will record aggregate pretax restructuring charges of approximately 50 million related to this program almost all of which constitute termination benefits and all of which will result in future cash outlays this represents a decrease as compared to the prior estimate of aggregate pretax restructuring charges of 71 million to 85 million we expect to achieve annual pretax savings of approximately 25 million once the program is fully implemented and will begin realizing program related savings in the first quarter 2018 this represents a decrease as compared to the prior estimate of annual pretax savings of 27 million to 33 million the reduction in expected charges and annual pretax savings is the result of a decrease in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program 

2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan 

in 2016 we initiated a restructuring plan involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations the relocation and outsourcing of certain distribution operations and a related workforce reduction at certain of our facilities the 2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan these actions commenced in the first quarter 2016 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018 we estimate that we will incur aggregate pretax charges in connection with these restructuring activities of approximately 34 million to 44 million of which we estimate 27 million to 31 million will result in future cash outlays additionally we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately 17 million to 19 million in connection with the 2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan we began realizing planrelated savings in 2017 and expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 12 million to 16 million once the plan is fully implemented 

2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan 

in april 2014 we initiated a restructuring plan the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain highercost locations to existing lowercost locations these actions commenced in the second quarter 2014 

during the fourth quarter 2017 we executed an agreement with an alternate provider for the development and supply of a component to be included in certain kits primarily sold by our vascular north america and anesthesia north america operating segments this will result in increased development costs but also is expected to reduce the cost 

of the component supply once it becomes commercially available as compared to costs incurred with respect to current suppliers therefore we anticipate a net savings as a result of this agreement as a result we revised our cost  annual pretax savings and timing estimates with respect to the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan we estimate that we will incur aggregate pretax charges in connection with the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan of approximately 46 million  to 51 million  compared to our most recent prior estimate of approximately 43 million to 48 million additionally we estimate that we will achieve annual pretax savings of 26 million to 29 million as compared to our most recent prior estimate of 23 million to 27 million as a result of the changes to the plan described above we now expect the plan will be substantially complete by the end of 2021 as compared to our prior estimate of the second half of 2020 

we continue to anticipate an increase in annual revenues resulting from improved pricing on our vascular kits as a result of changes made to our medication delivery devices we anticipate that this projected increase in annual revenues taken together with the projected annual savings we expect to realize under the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan should enable us to improve our pretax income on an annual basis by approximately 31 million to 35 million once the plan has been completed 

we expect aggregate cash outlays associated with the plan to be in the range of 38 million to 43 million compared to our most recent prior estimate of approximately 33 million  to 38 million  additionally we continue to expect that we will incur 24 million  to 30 million  in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan 

2016 other restructuring programs 

during the second half of 2016 we commenced restructuring activities involving the consolidation of global administrative functions and manufacturing operations these programs are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2018 we estimate that we will record aggregate pretax charges of 38 million to 47 million related to these programs which constitute termination benefits and contract termination costs that will result in future cash outlays additionally we expect to incur approximately 15 million of accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the programs which we anticipate will be recognized in cost of goods sold we anticipate that approximately 10 million of this amount will result in cash outlays as of december 31 2017 we expect to achieve annual pretax savings of 90 million to 100 million once this program is fully implemented which is an increase to the prior estimate of 69 million to 85 million the increase in the estimated annual pretax savings is due to an increase in the headcount reduction initially contemplated under the program

interest expense   



comparison of 2017 and 2016 

the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding mainly attributable to borrowings under the credit agreement that were utilized to fund the vascular solutions and neotract acquisitions offset by a slight decline in the average interest rate on debt 

comparison of 2016 and 2015 

the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to our repurchase of our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the convertible notes from certain holders of those notes in exchange for cash and shares of our common stock which transactions are referred to below as exchange transactions and conversions of the convertible notes resulting in lower average amounts of debt outstanding compared to the prior period the decrease was also the result of a lower average interest rate due to our june 1 2015 redemption of our 6875 senior subordinated notes due 2019 the 2019 notes which were replaced by borrowings under our previous revolving credit facility and subsequently by our issuance of 4875 

senior notes due 2026 the “2026 notes” the interest rates on both the revolving credit facility and the 2026 notes are lower than the interest rate on the 2019 notes the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by financing fees of 34 million incurred for the year ended december 31 2016 to secure bridge financing commitments related to our acquisition of vascular solutions 

loss on extinguishment of debt   



for the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized a 56 million loss on the extinguishment of debt of which 52 million related to our repurchase on january 5 2017 of 917 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes through exchange transactions with certain holders of the convertible notes and 04 million related to the amendment and restatement of our previous credit agreement which was considered a partial extinguishment of debt see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

for the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of 193 million of which 163 million related to our repurchase of 2192 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes through exchange transactions with certain holders of the convertible notes and 30 million related to the conversions of 444 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes 

gain on sale of assets 



during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized a gain of 44 million primarily as a result of the sale for 89 million of two buildings one of which was previously classified as held for sale 

taxes on income from continuing operations   



we generate substantial earnings from our international operations most of the international jurisdictions in which we file tax returns historically have had statutory tax rates that are lower than the united states statutory tax rate as a result our consolidated effective income tax rate for 2017 excluding the impact of the tcja and earlier years has been substantially below the united states statutory tax rate the principal international jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rate in 2017 and earlier years is lower than the united states statutory tax rate and from which we derive substantial earnings include ireland bermuda luxembourg germany and italy 

 despite the tcjas reduction of the united states corporate income tax rate we anticipate that we will continue to have a consolidated effective income tax rate that is below the newly enacted statutory tax rate due to the lower tax rates applicable to our foreign operations in many of the relevant international jurisdictions however changes to either the currently enacted united states tax rates or international statutory tax rates could affect our effective income tax rate in the future 

excluding the impact of any discrete items the provisions of the tcja are expected to be neutral or to reduce somewhat our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to what the rate would have been prior to the adoption of the tcja  the ultimate impact on our effective tax rate will largely depend on a variety of factors including the portion of pretax earnings that we generate in various taxing jurisdictions 

comparison of 2017 and 2016 

the effective income tax rate for 2017  was 455  compared to 33 for 2016  taxes on income from continuing operations in 2017 were 1296 million  compared to 81 million  in 2016 the effective income tax rate for 2017  was impacted by a net tax expense of 1079 million resulting from the enactment of the tcja the 1079 million net tax expense reflects a tax expense of 1540 million for the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings partially offset by a 461 million tax benefit resulting from the reassessment and revaluation of the net deferred tax liabilities additionally the effective tax rate for 2017 was impacted by a net excess tax benefit related to sharebased compensation and a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

comparison of 2016 and 2015 

the effective income tax rate in 2016 was 33  compared to 32  in 2015 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2016 were 81 million  compared to 78 million  in 2015 the effective income tax rate for 2016 was impacted by a tax benefit associated with us federal tax return filings a benefit resulting from the reduction of german tax reserves as a result of the conclusion of an audit a benefit resulting from the expiration of various statutes of limitation and a benefit associated with an iprd asset impairment

the tcja significantly changes us tax law by among other things imposing a onetime repatriation tax on undistributed post1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries previously we were not taxed on foreign earnings deemed to be permanently invested overseas under the tcja we will have to pay 1540 million over eight years for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings regardless of whether such earnings are actually repatriated see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information as a result of the repatriation tax provisions of the tcja we anticipate that generally we will be able to access cash located at our foreign subsidiaries without incurring any additional us federal income tax liabilities we are not aware of any other restrictions on repatriation of these funds and subject to cash payment of additional foreign withholding taxes these funds could be repatriated if necessary 

we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs however as discussed above in global economic conditions although there have been recent improvements in certain countries global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity consequently we continue to monitor our credit risk particularly with respect to customers in greece italy portugal and spain as well as consider other risk mitigation strategies in january 2017 we sold 161 million of receivables payable from publicly funded hospitals in italy for 160 million 

 as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our net trade accounts receivable from publicly funded hospitals in greece italy portugal and spain were 247 million  and 292 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately 6  7  and 7  respectively of our total net revenues and average days that current and longterm trade accounts receivable with respect to these customers were outstanding were 154  182  and 204  days respectively as of december 31 2017  and 2016  net current and longterm trade accounts receivable from these countries were approximately 15  and 19  respectively of our consolidated net current and longterm trade accounts receivable if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries moreover if global economic conditions generally deteriorate we may experience further delays in customer payments reductions in our customers’ purchases and higher credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2018 and future years see critical accounting policies and estimates below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable 

the aggregate total fair value of consideration we provided for the acquisitions we made in 2017  and 2016  was 20 billion  and 228 million  respectively the most significant acquisitions completed in 2017 were vascular solutions and neotract see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

in january 2017 we entered into the credit agreement which provides for a fiveyear revolving credit facility of 10 billion and a term loan facility of 7500 million we used the term loan facility to finance most of the consideration for the vascular solutions acquisition the remaining consideration was provided through borrowings under the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital and other liquidity needs in addition during 2017 we reacquired through conversion or exchange and retired our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes which matured on august 1 2017 convertible notes using available funds under the revolving credit facility we also used 725 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance in part our acquisition of neotract additionally in november 2017 we sold 5000 million in principal amount of 4625 senior notes due 2027 the 2027 notes the net proceeds of which were used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

in connection with the original issuance of the convertible notes in 2010 we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction to purchase call options the call options enabled the company to economically hedge the dilutive impact of the convertible notes conversions on the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding in connection with convertible note conversions and exchanges we exercised or unwound these related call options we also entered into warrant transactions in connection with issuance of the convertible notes counterparties continue to hold warrants to purchase our common stock that they acquired at the time of the initial issuance of the convertible notes at december 31 2017 warrants to purchase 559614 shares at an exercise price of 7465 per share remained outstanding the remaining warrants expire ratably over a period ending on august 31 2018 at december 31 2017 the intrinsic value of the warrants ie the excess of the aggregate market price of the underlying shares over the aggregate exercise price of the warrants was 980 million 

we may at any time from time to time repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions exchange transactions or otherwise at such price or prices as we deem appropriate such purchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time

cash flows 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 



comparison of 2017  and 2016 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 4263 million  during 2017 and 4106 million  during 2016 the 157 million  increase is attributable to favorable operating results partially offset by a net cash outflow for income taxes resulting primarily from a tax refund received in 2016 excluding income taxes the net impact of the working capital changes was consistent in 2017 as compared to 2016 an increase in inventories was offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and to a lesser extent a net decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets the increase in inventories for the year ended december 31 2017 was 224 million compared to a decrease of 64 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase is attributable to inventory purchases to achieve desired safety stock levels as well as inventory from a former chinese distributor that was returned to us during 2017 as part of an arbitration proceeding see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding this arbitration proceeding the net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was 390 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to an increase of 154 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and benefit related accruals 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 18 billion  during 2017 primarily resulting from 18 billion in payments for businesses acquired principally vascular solutions and neotract and capital expenditures of 709 million which were partially offset by proceeds of 63 million from the sale of two properties one of which was a building that had been previously classified as held for sale 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was 11 billion  during 2017 primarily resulting from a net increase in borrowings of 12 billion our borrowings under the credit agreement included 10 billion to finance the vascular solutions acquisition together with related fees and expenses and 725 million to finance the neotract acquisition in addition we sold 500 million in principal amount of the 2027 notes these increases were partially offset by our repayments of 11 billion of borrowings under the credit agreement additionally we had a 1361 million reduction in borrowings under our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the convertible notes resulting from exchange transactions and payment upon maturity of all remaining convertible notes outstanding each of which is discussed below under borrowings 

net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was also impacted by dividend payments of 612 million and debt issuance and amendment fees of 267 million which included fees paid in connection with our entry into the credit agreement the issuance of the 2027 notes and a bridge facility and backstop commitment that was put in place to assist with the financing of the vascular solutions acquisition but was never utilized because the required financing was provided under the credit agreement 

comparison of 2016  and 2015 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 4106 million during 2016 and 3034 million during 2015 the 1072 million increase is primarily attributable to improved operating results a net favorable impact from changes in working capital and a reduction in income tax payments 

the net cash inflow from working capital is primarily the result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable the cash inflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses was 154 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to a cash outflow of 01 million for the year ended december 31 2015 the cash inflow for accounts payable and accrued expenses excluding the impact of the net increase in the restructuring reserve is attributable to certain nonrecurring accrued expense payments made during the year ended december 31 2015 the cash inflow for inventories was 64 million in 2016 as compared to a 84 million net cash outflow in 2015 the lower inventory levels in 2016 are primarily the result of higher than expected net revenues in the fourth quarter and fewer inventory builds in support of distributor to direct sales conversions the cash outflow related to accounts receivable was 110 million in 2016 as compared to a cash inflow of 04 million in 2015 the increase in accounts receivable for the year ended december 31 2016 is attributable to higher fourth quarter net revenues as compared to 2015 partially offset by stronger collections particularly in europe 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 570 million during 2016 primarily resulting from capital expenditures of 531 million and payments for businesses and intangibles acquired of 140 million the acquired business and intangibles included certain assets of cartika medical inc and certain distributors in new zealand which were comprised primarily of intangible assets including goodwill and inventory these payments were partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of 102 million primarily related to two buildings 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 1187 million during 2016 primarily resulting from dividends paid of 590 million and a net reduction in borrowings of 429 million the net reduction in borrowings included reductions of 2636 million resulting from exchange transactions and conversions related to convertible notes and the net reduction of 1860 million in the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility partially offset by our issuance of 4000 million in principal amount of the 2026 notes and increased borrowings of 67 million under our securitization program net cash used in financing activities also reflected a 92 million payment for our acquisition of the remaining 26 noncontrolling interest of teleflex medical private limited our indian affiliate in which we already owned the 74 controlling interest 90 million in debt extinguishment issuance and amendment fees including transaction fees associated with the issuance of the 2026 notes and 73 million in contingent consideration payments these cash payments were partially offset by 91 million of net proceeds from sharebased compensation plans and the related tax benefits primarily related to stock option exercises 

financing arrangements 

  

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 



fixed rate debt comprised 507  and 751  of total debt at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings at december 31 2017 compared to the fixed rate borrowings as a percentage of total borrowings at december 31 2016 is primarily due to variable rate borrowings under our amended and restated senior credit facility described below offset by the increase in fixed rate borrowings as a result of the issuance of the 2027 notes 

amended and restated senior credit facility 

on january 20 2017 we amended and restated our thenexisting senior credit agreement by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement the “credit agreement” as noted above the credit agreement provides for a fiveyear revolving credit facility of 10 billion and a term loan facility of 7500 million the term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance the acquisition of vascular solutions the obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed subject to certain exceptions and limitations by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and each guarantors owned assets the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility will mature on january 20 2022 and february 17 2022 respectively at december 31 2017  we had 3490 million  in borrowings outstanding and approximately 32 million  in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 10 billion revolving credit facility 

the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that among other things and subject to certain exceptions qualifications and thresholds place limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness create additional liens enter into a merger consolidation or amalgamation dispose of certain assets make certain investments or acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements additionally the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio generally consolidated total funded indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement on the determination date to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the determination date of not more than 450 to 1 a secured leverage ratio generally consolidated senior secured funded indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement on the determination date to consolidated ebitda as defined in the 2017 credit agreement for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending on or preceding the determination date of not more than 350 to 1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda for the four most recent quarters ending on or preceding the determination date to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement paid in cash for such period of not less than 350 to 1 

see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the credit agreement 

2024 2026 and 2027 senior notes collectively the senior notes 

as of december 31 2017 the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 notes 2026 notes and 2027 notes was 2500 4000 million and 5000 million respectively the indentures governing the 2024 notes and 2026 notes contain covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions and pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock subject to specified conditions the indenture governing the 2027 notes contains covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets and enter into sale leaseback transactions the obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our existing and future 100 owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the credit agreement and by certain of our other 100 owned domestic subsidiaries as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior notes 

accounts receivable securitization 

we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 500 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2017  we borrowed the maximum amount available of 500 million  under this facility this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred as of december 31 2016  we had 500 million  of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

convertible notes 

our convertible notes matured on august 1 2017 the maturity date the convertible notes were convertible under certain circumstances including the attainment of at least a specified last reported sales price per share of our common stock during a specified period since the fourth quarter 2013 our closing stock price exceeded the threshold for conversion moreover commencing on may 1 2017 and through july 28 2017 the convertible notes were convertible regardless of the closing price of our stock we elected a net settlement method to satisfy our conversion obligations under which we settled the conversion of convertible notes by paying the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and providing shares having a value equal to the excess of the conversion value of the convertible notes over the principal amount of the notes however cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares 

in january 2017 we acquired 917 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes in exchange for an aggregate of 932 million in cash including approximately 15 million in accrued and previously unpaid interest and approximately 093 million shares of our common stock the “exchange transactions” we funded the cash portion of the consideration paid through borrowings under our revolving credit facility in advance of the maturity of the convertible notes 442 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes the converted notes were tendered to us for conversion on the maturity date we repaid the remaining 443 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes outstanding together with unpaid interest due and owing on the convertible notes the “cash payment” in addition to the cash payment on the maturity date we delivered to the holders of the converted notes in the aggregate 05 million shares of our common stock we funded the cash payment through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

contractual obligations   

contractual obligations at december 31 2017  are as follows 



 

we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 123 million  and 175 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made and as a result these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of 2721 million  and 71 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively of which 742 million  and 06 million respectively were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

see notes 10 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions 

  

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable after considering the companys historical collection experience the length of time an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 103 million  and 86 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively which constituted 28  and 30  of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

in light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years we have procedures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customerbycustomer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts these procedures include monthly credit control committee meetings at which customer credit risks are identified after review of among other things accounts that exceed specified credit limits payment delinquencies and other customer issues in addition with respect to government customers we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices to reduce risk exposures with respect to certain of our nongovernment customers we have instituted procedures that include reducing credit limits and requiring that payments accompany orders some of our customers particularly in greece italy spain and portugal have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain additional allowances may be required in future periods 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that the allowances will be sufficient to cover future losses given the volatility in the worldwide economy and the possibility that other unanticipated events may adversely affect collectability of the accounts if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

  

we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim distributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information when necessary we adjust the reserves with a corresponding adjustment to revenue to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 122 million  and 116 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively we expect to pay amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31 2017  within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

inventory utilization 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability the reduction in carrying value is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

the adequacy of the reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage 

our inventory reserve was 356 million  and 364 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively which represents 83  and 103 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

longlived assets 

  

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for example such an assessment may be initiated if as a result of a change in expectations we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets include indefinitelived assets such as goodwill certain trade names and inprocess research and development iprd as well as finitelived intangibles such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives customer relationships intellectual property and distribution rights the costs of finitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows which are key elements in determining fair value assumptions we use in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans we believe these assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

goodwill 

  

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment we have ten reporting units in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test described below alternatively we may test goodwill for impairment through the twostep quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis under guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be simplified effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 subject to optional early adoption see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value in performing the first step we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which we determine in the second step of the twostep test the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2017  as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in 2016 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting units carrying value to exceed its fair value while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline in this regard if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges moreover changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value in which case we also may incur material impairment charges 

we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2017  as noted above under “changes in reporting segments” because changes in our operating segments during the fourth quarter 2017 affected certain of our reporting units we reallocated the goodwill balances of the reporting units based on their relative fair values and performed goodwill impairment analyses on those reporting units we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses 

other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test 

in connection with the quantitative impairment test since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value the fair value of trade names and iprd is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the value of the hypothetical royalty which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management must estimate the volume of sales hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar intangible assets are being licensed in the marketplace 

no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2017  for the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized a pretax iprd impairment charge of 410 million see restructuring and impairment charges within result of operations above as well as note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on this charge 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

  



for additional information on assumptions pertaining to pension and other postretirement benefit plans refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

sharebased compensation 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option share based compensation expense for 2017  2016  and 2015  was 194 million  169 million  and 145 million  respectively

in connection with an acquisition we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the neotract acquisition which represented the vast majority of our contingent consideration liabilities at december 31 2017 using a monte carlo valuation approach which simulates future revenues during the earn outperiod using managements best estimates we determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow analysis increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements decreases in these items may have the opposite effect increases in discount rates and the period prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value 

measurements decreases in these items may have the opposite effect see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we remeasure the liability each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilitys fair value within selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we accrued 2721 million  and 71 million  of contingent consideration respectively for the year ended december 31 2017  there were no changes to the estimated probabilities associated with the contingent consideration liabilities for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  we recognized a reduction to contingent consideration of 83 million  and 44 million  respectively resulting from changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory and sales milestones 

income taxes 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities management must among other things make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final united states and foreign tax settlements changes in tax law and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1048 million  and 1045 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment we are currently under examination in canada germany italy and the united states the ultimate outcome of these examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions 

as noted above the tcja significantly changes us tax law as permitted by sab 118 we have included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 provisional amounts reflecting the tax impact related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities once our accounting for the income tax effects of the tcja is complete the amounts with respect to the income tax effects of the tcja may differ from these provisional amounts possibly materially due to among other things additional analysis changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the tcja see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates on december 31 2017  were determined using a base rate of the onemonth libor rate plus the applicable spread 



a change of 10 in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by 71 million  based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2017  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we enter into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge the risk associated with these exposures these contracts generally involve the purchase or sale at designated future dates of specified amounts of a foreign currency while simultaneously committing to an opposite way sale or purchase of a specified amount of us dollars or euros based on the exchange rate at the time of entry into the contract the contracts we enter into to hedge transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies are designated as cash flow hedges the contracts to hedge monetary asset and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the accounting treatment of designated and nondesignated hedge contracts 

the following table provides information regarding our open foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2017  which mature during 2018  as of december 31 2017  the total notional amount for the designated and nondesignated contracts expressed in us dollars is 885 million  and 1106 million  respectively as of december 31 2016  the total notional amount for the designated and nondesignated contracts expressed in us dollars is 1018 million  and 734 million  respectively forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies

business 

tableend teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we manufacture our products at approximately 30  manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the united states 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 

 our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to bring cost effective innovative products to market that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications as well as enhancements to and line extensions of existing products we introduced 25  new products and line extensions during 2016  our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of class i and class ii devices most of which require 510k clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda for sale in the united states and some of which are exempt from the requirement to obtain 510k clearance we believe that 510k clearance or 510kexempt status reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii devices see government regulation below 

our segments

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

beginning in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our other businesses which served the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we became exclusively a medical device company 

we expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives 

acquisition of vascular solutions 

on february 17 2017 we acquired vascular solutions inc a medical device company focused on developing clinical solutions for minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures “vascular solutions” see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

distributortodirect sales conversions and restructuring programs 

we have completed conversions from distributor sales to direct sales in several countries including australia korea japan and certain countries within our emea segment we recently determined to undertake a distributor to direct sales conversion in china as a result of our decision to eliminate a key distributor within that sales channel see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  segment results  comparison of 2016 and 2015  asia for further information regarding this initiative these distributor to direct sales conversions generally involve eliminating a distributor from the sales channel either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distribution relationship in some instances particularly in asia the conversions relate to our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through third party subdistributors or through new distributors the distributor to direct sales conversions enable us to obtain improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel additionally we continue to execute restructuring programs to improve efficiencies in our sales and marketing and research and development organizations and in our manufacturing and distribution facilities 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the united states 

all of our medical devices manufactured or sold in the united states are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” and its implementing regulations which are enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling storage record keeping clearance approval advertising and promotion distribution postmarket surveillance import and export of our medical devices 

unless an exemption or preamendment grandfather status applies each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance as a class i or class ii device by submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval as a class iii device by filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed 510kcleared device or preamendment device for which fda has not called for pmas referred to as the predicate device substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process the process for approval when no substantially equivalent device exists if the fda agrees it is a low to moderate risk device a device not eligible for 510k clearance or de novo clearance is categorized as class iii and must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k process it generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i and class ii devices that require 510k clearance although a few are 510k exempt in addition modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained in a timely matter if at all for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k clearance the sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s investigational device exemption “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board irb which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review biomedical research involving human subjects and which 

has the authority to approve require modifications in or disapprove research to protect the rights safety and welfare of the human research subject the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients an irb may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or may impose other conditions 

a device placed on the market must comply with numerous regulatory requirements those regulatory requirements include the following 

 in september 2013 the fda issued final regulations and draft guidance documents regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which requires manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers while the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it will require us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements having taken effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2018 

certain of our medical devices are sold in convenience kits that include a drug component such as lidocaine these types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the center for devices and radiological health or cdrh under the device regulations because the device provides the primary mode of action of the kit although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices “cgmps” to the extent applicable to the drugcomponent repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cgmps as well as other regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections to verify compliance with the qsr as well as other regulatory requirements if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

regulation of medical devices outside of the united states 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the united states in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the united states targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any 

remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the united states that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

we are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry recent rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members the reported data is available to the public on the cms website failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and certain other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the united state that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonunited states government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the united states we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the united states government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees distributors or other agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness our major competitors include c r bard inc medtronic plc and becton dickinson and company 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly aluminum steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and our efforts to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures our research and development expenditures were 586 million  521 million  and 610 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or stock price the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products due to among other things our inability to 



 in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement or the reduction in reimbursement levels for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly in some countries medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected in this regard we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by discouraging customers’ selection of our products and reducing the prices they are willing to pay 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including facility consolidations organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce while we have realized some efficiencies from these actions we may not realize the benefits of these initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our other strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning or erp systems to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives however as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our united states revenues is derived from sales to distributors and “destocking” activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenues in the united states is derived from sales to distributors who in turn sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions from time to time these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products which we refer to as “destocking” a distributors decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product distributor buying decisions including with respect to competing products changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels economic conditions and other factors for example during the third quarter of 2016 we experienced a decline in purchases by our united states distributors that adversely affected our revenues and results of operations we believe the reduction resulted from the distributors expectations of a less severe 20162017 flu season which resulted in reduced levels of purchasing with respect to certain of our products that are used for treatment of hospitalized patients suffering from the flu following such instances of reduced purchases distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels nevertheless we cannot assure that distributors will in fact increase purchases of our products in this manner a decline in the level of product purchases by our united states distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern among other things the development design approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k or de novo clearance or approval of a premarket approval application or pma from the fda similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign government authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 



 we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated promoting a device for an offlabel use or making misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation which requires periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation in addition any facilities assembling convenience kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

 if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals our first report was submitted in 2014 and the reported information was made publicly available in a searchable format in september 2014 in addition device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer of value or ownership or investment 

interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california connecticut nevada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims as well as product recalls any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death in addition in connection with the divestitures of our former nonmedical businesses we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to those businesses which include among other things liability for products manufactured prior to the date on which we completed the sale of the business product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the related legal defense costs may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by regulatory authorities to participate in a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could harm our reputation decrease demand for our products lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets   combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred in recent years led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending resulting in reductions delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services despite some improvements in recent years economic conditions continue to cause disruption in some financial markets resulting in among other things diminished liquidity and credit availability we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors the continuation of the present broadly applicable economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

additionally our customers particularly in italy spain portugal and greece have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided which has increased our focus on collectability with respect to our accounts receivable from these customers to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional operating needs however the ongoing uncertainty in the european financial markets combined with a continuation of constrained european credit markets creates a risk that some of our european customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity as of december 31 2016  and 2015  our net current and long term trade accounts receivable in italy spain portugal and greece were 511 million  and 623 million  respectively in 2016  2015  and 2014  net 

revenues from these countries were approximately 7  7  and 8  of total net revenues respectively and average days that accounts receivable from these countries were outstanding were 182  204  and 223  days respectively although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot assure that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns even if we are successful in completing an acquisition the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than we anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges and other issues that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including issues related to internal control over financial reporting regulatory compliance and shortterm effects of increased costs on results of operations although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the united states pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the affordable care act 



in 2015  and 2014  we recorded expenses of 102 million  and 127 million  respectively with respect to the medical device excise tax while the excise tax has been suspended in 2016 and 2017 unless the suspension is extended we will again be subject to the excise tax in 2018 we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in this regard president trump and several congressional leaders have expressed an intention to repeal the affordable care act and adopt legislation to replace that act although more recent statements by president trump and several members of congress indicate that some time may elapse before any legislative action with respect to the affordable care act is effected therefore the continued viability of or the nature of any modification of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act is highly uncertain and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonunited states operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the united states including belgium the czech republic germany ireland malaysia mexico in addition a significant portion of our nonunited states revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors as of december 31 2016  77  of our fulltime and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states as of december 31 2016  and 2015  approximately 45  and 43  respectively of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states in addition for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  approximately 46  47  and 50  respectively of our net revenues based on the teleflex entity generating the sale were derived from operations outside the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states including 

 in addition the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonunited states jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonunited states officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded united states corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees distributors or other agents in addition we may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire violations of antibribery laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also could be subject to severe 

penalties and other adverse consequences including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in united states government contracts 

the risks relating to our foreign operations may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates products manufactured in and sold into foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonunited states currencies to united states dollars our reporting currency as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities as well as transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates which we refer to as nonfunctional currencies a strengthening or weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro will affect our united states dollarreported revenue and income although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum and steel increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need in addition our borrowing costs could be adversely affected if interest rates increase any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events 

we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortages unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors including 

 our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

research and development for some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and as a result no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the united states we cannot assure that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop knowhow 

and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be required to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business 

we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  we had total consolidated indebtedness of 1046 million  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

 if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

 we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 525 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes and our 4875 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to among other things 

 in addition our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement a breach of any covenants under any one or more of our debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

the contingent conversion features of our convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2010 we issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the “convertible notes” the convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including the attainment of a last reported sale price per share of our common stock equal to 130 of the conversion price approximately 7972 for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter since the fourth quarter 2013 and in all subsequent fiscal quarters the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded the 130 threshold moreover commencing on may 1 2017 and through july 28 2017 the convertible notes are convertible regardless of our stock price and the convertible notes mature in august 2017 as a result the convertible notes are classified as a current liability which in turn has resulted in a material reduction of our net working capital in april 2016 and january 2017 we exchanged 3109 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes in for cash and our common stock pursuant to the terms of separate privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of the convertible notes in addition holders of 448 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes have effected conversions in accordance with the terms of the convertible notes see “convertible notes  exchange transactions” and “convertible notes  conversions” within note 8 and “exchange transactions” within note 13 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information following the exchange transactions and conversions and as of february 13 2017 443 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes remain outstanding at this time we have elected the net settlement method to satisfy the conversion obligation under which we will settle the principal amount of the convertible notes converted in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares while our conversion obligations have been substantially reduced as a result of the exchange transactions and conversions described above and we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amount due on the remaining outstanding convertible notes through a combination of our existing cash on hand amounts available under our revolving credit facility and if necessary amounts provided through the capital markets our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity see convertible notes within note 8  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the convertible notes 

the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may adversely affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with two counterparties which we refer to as the hedge counterparties the hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the convertible notes and reduce the dilution with respect to our common stock andor cash payments that we may be required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties under which we may be obligated to issues shares of our common stock the warrants initially related to the same number of shares of our common stock as were initially subject to the hedge transactions and have an exercise price of 7465 subject to customary antidilution adjustments in connection with the exchange transactions referenced in the preceding risk factor we entered into agreements with the hedge counterparties that reduced the scope of the hedge transactions so that they cover only the number of shares of our common stock underlying the convertible notes that remained outstanding following the exchange transactions we also entered into agreements with the such dealer counterparties to reduce the number of shares subject to the warrants nevertheless based on recent market prices of our common stock the warrant transactions have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or if we so elect obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants in addition under applicable accounting guidance changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation with respect to the convertible notes and warrants which in turn could impact our reported financial results based on the average market price of our common stock during 2016  17 million  shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants were included in the total diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2016  for additional information see “financing arrangements” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k 

in connection with establishing their positions under the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates entered into various cashsettled overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the convertible notes the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates may in their sole discretion with or without notice modify their hedge positions from time to time and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to the conversion of the convertible notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution and we will be subject to the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of each hedge counterparty is not secured by any collateral if a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by a hedge counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes which could lower the price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2016  we had outstanding approximately 44 million  shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 16 million  shares of our common stock of which approximately 10 million  were vested as of that date restricted stock units covering approximately 03 million  shares of our common stock 

which are expected to vest over the next three years and approximately 12000  shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan as of december 31 2016  142 million  shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options upon conversion of the convertible notes and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore our issuance of shares following the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options and warrants the vested of restricted stock units and the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock including common stock issued as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants vesting of restricted stock units or conversion of the convertible notes could depress the price of our common stock 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders generate invoices collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and in some cases have caused significant harm although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur expenses or lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business 

in 2012 the sec promulgated rules under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and if so whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country in accordance with applicable regulations we filed conflict minerals reports in 2014 2015 and 2016 as discussed in these reports we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we have undertaken and continue to undertake efforts to identify where such minerals originated we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require that our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups due to among other things our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all moreover we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide products that are drc conflict free we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 12  of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings compliance with covenants in our debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our convertible notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the convertible notes and the indentures governing the convertible notes the 2024 notes and the 2026 notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if an acquisition event constitutes a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash similarly if an acquisition event constitutes a “change of control” as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 notes and 2026 notes holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in addition if an acquisition event constitutes a “makewhole fundamental change” as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes we may be required under certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such acquisition event in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible notes the 2024 notes and the 2026 notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies 

we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives based on our evaluation we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives in addition we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position for a discussion of our ongoing restructuring programs see restructuring and other impairment charges under “results of operations” below finally we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions which generally involves eliminating a distributor from the sales channel thereby enabling us to obtain improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel 

during 2016 we completed acquisitions of businesses that complement our oem and asia reportable operating segments in addition during this period we acquired the remaining 26  ownership interest in an indian affiliate teleflex medical private limited from the noncontrolling shareholders the total fair value of the consideration for these transactions was 228 million 

during 2015 we completed several acquisitions of businesses that complement the anesthesia surgical ligation vascular and oem product portfolios as well as several acquisitions of distributors of medical devices and supplies the total fair value of consideration for these acquisitions was 965 million   

on february 17 2017 the company acquired all of the common stock and voting equity interest in vascular solutions inc “vascular solutions” for 5600 per share in cash or a total of approximately 10 billion vascular solutions is a medical device company that focuses on developing clinical solutions for minimally invasive coronary and peripheral vascular procedures the acquisition is expected to meaningfully accelerate the growth of our vascular and interventional access product portfolios through increased revenue associated with entry into the coronary and peripheral vascular market as well as increased crossportfolio selling opportunities to both our and vascular solutions customer bases 

health care reform 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the affordable care act was signed into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourage patient outcome driven results the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage statistics patient outcomes and patient satisfaction moreover in light of the expressed intent of president trump and several members of congressional leadership to repeal the affordable care act and adopt a form of replacement legislation the continued viability of or the nature of any modification of or legislative substitution for the affordable care act as well as the effect of any of these events if they occur is highly uncertain 

the affordable care act imposed a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices beginning in 2013 although the excise tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017 its status remains unclear for 2018 and subsequent years for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  we recorded medical device excise taxes of 102 million  and 127 million  respectively which are included in selling general and administrative expenses 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions in recent years have had adverse impacts on market activities due to among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities although on a consolidated basis the consequences of economic conditions other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years the continuation of the present broadly applicable economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly with respect to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity 

in recent years hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures consequently hospitals took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending more recently the economic environment has improved somewhat but has not returned to prerecession levels and challenges persist particularly in some european countries as discussed below approximately 94  of our net revenues come from singleuse products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change conversely our sales volume could be positively impacted due to increases in the number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered although as noted above the affordable care act may be subject to repeal modification or replacement 

a number of european countries continue to contend with considerable government debt annual deficits and high levels of unemployment despite some indications of a more positive economic outlook in europe the healthcare sector remains weak in particular budgetary restraints among european countries have led to cost control measures such as delays in approvals for elective surgeriesthe public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which continues to result in delays in payments to us by customers in these countries moreover the impact of brexit economic and trade policies of the trump administration and the results of several 2017 elections in european nations including germany and france are uncertain and could have a profound economic effect in europe and elsewhere 

in asia governments have intensified efforts to manage the cost of healthcare in response to an uncertain economic environment that has resulted in moderate growth rates across the region we are experiencing an increasing trend of governmentdriven price management and reimbursement controls particularly in china japan and indonesia there also has been an increase in government initiatives to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market moreover many countries in the region have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements and as a result we expect longer costlier and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries 

in latin america some highly regulated economies such as argentina and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors 

results of operations 

as used in this discussion new products are products that we have sold for 36 months or less and “existing products” are products that we have sold for more than 36 months discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects for the first 12 months following the acquisition of a distributor the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from the elimination of the distributor from the sales channel to the extent an acquired distributor had preacquisition sales of products other than ours the impact of the postacquisition 

sales of those products on our results of operations is included within our discussion of the impact of acquired businesses 

certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis which may cause minor differences 

revenues 



comparison of 2016   and 2015 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 increased 32  or 583 million  compared to the prior year the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes of existing products of 373 million and an increase in new product sales of 242 million both across all of our segments the increase was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

comparison of 2015   and 2014 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased 16  or 301 million  compared to the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 1291 million primarily in the emea and asia segments the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by a net increase in sales volumes of existing products in most of our segments of 519 million and a net increase in new product sales in most of our segments of 194 million in addition the decrease was further offset by sales by acquired businesses primarily human medics co ltd “human medics” a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the korean market minilap a developer of microlaparoscopic instrumentation mayo healthcare pty limited mayo healthcare a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the australian market n stenning  co pty ltd stenning a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the australian market and truphatek holdings 1993 limited truphatek a manufacturer of a broad range of disposable and reusable laryngoscope devices which generated 148 million and net price increases primarily in the asia and surgical north america segments which generated 128 million 

gross profit 



comparison of 2016 and 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2016 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 110 basis points or 21  compared to the prior year the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in sales of higher margin products primarily in the anesthesia north america and emea segments as well as lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives including the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan 

comparison of 2015   and 2014 

for the year ended december 31 2015 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 100 basis points or 20 compared to the prior year the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the 70 basis point impact of a net increase in sales of higher margin products primarily in the surgical north america and oem segments the 60 basis point impact of a net increase in sales volumes of existing products primarily in the vascular north america emea and asia segments and the 30 basis point impact of net price increases primarily in the asia and surgical north america segments gross margin was negatively impacted by the 80 basis point impact of net unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and costs associated with product recalls and quality issues first identified during the second quarter 2015 partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives   

selling general and administrative 



comparison of 2016 and 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 57 million during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the suspension of the excise tax on medical devices under the affordable care act of 102 million and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchanges rates of 27 million partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses of 75 million 

comparison of 2015 and 2014 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 97 million during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the prior year the decrease is due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of 285 million and a reduction in medical device excise tax of 25 million these declines were partially offset by expenses associated with our 2015 acquisitions and distributortodirect sales conversions of 114 million an increase in selling expenses of 54 million primarily related to higher sales commissions a reduction as compared to 2014 in the benefit resulting from the reversal of contingent consideration liabilities of 29 million and higher amortization expense of 26 million 

research and development 



comparison of 2016   and 2015 

the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2016 is primarily attributable to increased spending on new product development with respect to several of our segments 

comparison of 2015   and 2014 

the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 resulted from efficiencies realized through our integration of research and development projects commenced by certain businesses acquired in 2013 that were reflected in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 the decrease is also attributable to the late stage technology acquisitions made in 2015 which supplement our organic research and development initiatives 

restructuring and other impairment charges   



2016 restructuring charges 

for the year ended december 31 2016 the restructuring charges primarily related to the 2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan and to a lesser extent to other restructuring programs which are described below the restructuring charges recognized for the year ended december 31 2016 included termination benefits and contract termination costs of 132 million and 17 million respectively 

2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan 

on february 23 2016 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan involving the consolidation of operations and a related workforce reduction at certain of our facilities the 2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan we estimate that we will incur aggregate pretax charges in connection with these restructuring activities of approximately 34 million to 44 million of which we estimate 27 million to 31 million will result in future cash outlays additionally we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately 17 million to 19 million in connection with the 2016 manufacturing footprint realignment plan we currently expect to achieve annualized savings of 12 million to 16 million once the plan is fully implemented and currently expect to realize planrelated savings beginning in 2017 

2016 other restructuring programs 

during 2016 we committed to certain actions designed to further improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs these actions include the consolidation of global administrative functions and manufacturing operations these programs commenced in the second half of 2016 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2018 we estimate that we will record aggregate pretax charges of 38 million to 47 million related to these programs substantially all of which constitute termination benefits and lease termination costs that will result in future cash outlays additionally we expect to incur approximately 15 million of accelerated depreciation and other costs directly related to the programs which will be recognized in cost of goods sold we anticipate that approximately 06 million of this amount will result in future outlays we expect to achieve annualized pretax savings of 69 million to 85 million once this program has been fully implemented and anticipate that we will begin realizing savings related to the programs in 2017 

2015 restructuring charges 

for the year ended december 31 2015 the restructuring charges primarily related to restructuring programs that were initiated in conjunction with the reorganization of certain of our businesses and shared service center functions as well as the consolidation of certain of our facilities in north america the restructuring charges recognized for the year ended december 31 2015 included termination benefits and contract termination costs of 58 million and 14 million respectively 

2014 restructuring charges 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized restructuring charges related to several programs including the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan the 2014 european restructuring plan and other 2014 restructuring programs which are described below the restructuring charges recorded for the year ended december 31 2014 included termination benefits and contract termination costs of 169 million and 33 million respectively the restructuring charges were partially offset by a net credit of 32 million resulting from the reversal of contract termination costs due to the favorable settlement of a terminated distributor agreement related to the lma restructuring program which was initiated following our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma international nv the lma business in 2012 to integrate the lma business into our other businesses 

2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan 

in april 2014 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan involving the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain facilities and the relocation of manufacturing operations from certain highercost locations to existing lowercost locations these actions commenced in the second quarter 2014 and were initially expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2017 

to date we have completed the consolidation and relocation of a significant portion of the operations subject to the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan and achieved annualized savings of 17 million at december 31 2016 directly related to these actions with respect to the remaining actions to be taken under the plan we revised our savings expense and timing estimates during the third quarter 2016 to reflect the impact of changes we have implemented with respect to medication delivery devices included in certain kits primarily sold by our vascular north america operating segment and to a lesser extent certain kits primarily sold by our anesthesia north america operating segment as a result of these changes we have reduced our estimate with respect to the overall annualized savings we expect to realize under the plan from our prior estimate of 28 million to 35 million to a range of 23 million to 27 million we anticipate that this decrease in projected savings will be offset in large part by an expected increase in annual revenues resulting from improved pricing on the affected vascular kits directly related to the changes described above we anticipate that this projected increase in annual revenues taken together with the projected annualized savings we expect to realize under the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan should enable us to improve our pretax income on an annualized basis by approximately 28 million to 33 million once the plan has been completed 

as a result of the changes described above we also revised our estimates with respect to the charges we expect to incur in connection with the plan specifically we now estimate that we will incur 43 million to 48 million in aggregate pretax charges associated with the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan compared to our prior estimate of approximately 37 million to 44 million in addition we expect cash outlays associated with the plan to be in the range of 33 million to 38 million compared to our prior estimate of approximately 26 million to 31 million we continue to expect to incur 24 million to 30 million in aggregate capital expenditures under the plan 

we currently expect that the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan will be substantially complete by the end of the first half of 2020 rather than the end of 2017 which we previously anticipated 

we currently are evaluating the feasibility of alternative measures designed to mitigate the loss of expected savings and accelerate the currently estimated timetable for completion of the plan 

2014 european restructuring plan 

in 2014 we committed to a restructuring plan which impacts certain administrative functions in europe and involves the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at certain of our european facilities we expect future restructuring charges if any to be nominal and we expect to complete this plan in 2017 

other 2014 restructuring programs 

in june 2014 we initiated programs to consolidate locations in australia and terminate certain european distributor agreements in an effort to reduce costs we completed these programs in 2015 

other impairment charges 

iprd impairment charge

interest expense   



comparison of 2016 and 2015 

the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the repurchase through exchange transactions with holders of our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the convertible notes and conversions of the convertible notes each of which is described in more detail in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k resulting in lower average amounts of debt outstanding compared to the prior period the decrease was also the result of a lower average interest rate due to our june 1 2015 redemption of our 6875 senior subordinated notes due 2019 the 2019 notes which were replaced by borrowings under our revolving credit facility and subsequently by our issuance of 4875 senior notes due 2026 the “2026 notes” both the revolving credit facility and the 2026 notes carry interest rates that are lower than the 2019 notes the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by financing fees of 34 million incurred for the year ended december 31 2016 to secure the bridge financing commitments as described in more detail in liquidity and capital resources section below and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

comparison of 2015 and 2014

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding 

dividends taxes scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

of our 5438 million  of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016  5275 million  was held at foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and subject to cash payment of additional united states income taxes or foreign withholding taxes these funds could be repatriated if necessary any additional taxes could be offset at least in part by foreign tax credits the amount of any taxes required to be paid which could be significant and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense because taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested 

we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs however as discussed above in global economic conditions although there have been recent improvements in certain countries global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity consequently we continue to monitor our credit risk particularly with respect to customers in greece italy portugal and spain as well as consider other risk mitigation strategies in january 2017 we sold 161 million of receivables payable from publicly funded hospitals in italy for 160 million 

 as of december 31 2016  and 2015  our net trade receivables from publicly funded hospitals in greece italy portugal and spain were 292 million  and 374 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately 7  7  and 8  respectively of total net revenues and average days that current and longterm accounts receivable were outstanding were 182  204  and 223  days respectively as of december 31 2016  and 2015  net current and longterm accounts receivable from these countries were approximately 19  and 24  respectively of our consolidated net current and longterm accounts receivable if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries moreover if global economic conditions generally deteriorate we may experience further delays in customer payments reductions in our customers’ purchases and higher credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2017 and future years see critical accounting policies and estimates below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable 

on february 17 2017 we acquired vascular solutions for 10 billion in cash which we financed through a combination of borrowings under our increased revolving credit facility and a new senior secured term loan facility both of which were provided under our amended and restated credit agreement see financing arrangements below for additional information regarding these facilities however in december 2016 concurrent with our entry into the agreement to acquire vascular solutions we secured bridge financing commitments to ensure our ability to pay the purchase price for the vascular solutions acquisition and fees costs and expenses related to the acquisition in connection with the bridge commitments we incurred 55 million in financing costs of which 34 million was recognized as of december 31 2016 and the remainder was recognized in 2017 these financing costs were paid in february 2017 the bridge commitments terminated upon our execution of an amendment and restatement of our credit agreement

exercised their conversion rights under the convertible notes we funded the cash portion of the conversion obligation through borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of february 13 2017 the outstanding balance of the convertible notes after giving effect to january 2017 exchange transactions was 443 million our convertible notes are scheduled to mature in 2017 and we intend to repay the convertible notes with funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand 

we may at any time from time to time repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases or by tender at any price or in privately negotiated transactions exchange transactions or otherwise such purchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time

the net cash outflow from the other working capital items is primarily the result of cash outflows for inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a cash inflow for accounts receivable the net cash outflow for the purchase of inventories was 84 million in 2015 as compared to a 155 million net cash outflow in 2014 the reduction in the cash outflow is primarily due to service level improvements and the consolidation of distribution facilities associated with restructuring initiatives as well as fewer inventory builds in support of distributor to direct conversions the accounts payable and accrued expenses net cash outflow was 01 million in 2015 as compared to cash outflow of 98 million in 2014 the decrease in the cash outflow is primarily a result of the timing of vendor and employee related benefit payments as well as a 40 million decrease in interest payments yearoveryear the net cash inflow for accounts receivable was 04 million during 2015 as compared to a cash inflow of 94 million in 2014 which was primarily the result of increased collections in the emea region in 2014 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 1548 million during 2015 primarily due to net payments of 938 million for the businesses acquired in 2015 which included nostix llc a developer of catheter tip confirmation systems truphatek holdings limited and atsina surgical llc a developer of surgical clips among others and capital expenditures of 614 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 856 million during 2015 primarily resulting from repayments of outstanding debt totaling 3038 million including the redemption of the entire 250 million outstanding principal amount of the 2019 notes and the repayment of 50 million and 35 million under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility respectively additionally we paid 565 million in dividends and 80 million in contingent consideration related to our acquisition of minilap we also incurred 90 million of debt extinguishment issuance and amendment fees primarily as a result of a make whole payment in connection with the redemption of the 2019 notes these cash outflows were partially offset by 2881 million of proceeds from borrowings including 2460 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 421 million of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility in addition we realized net cash inflows of 50 million from sharebased compensation activity which included proceeds from the exercise and vesting of sharebased awards under our stock compensation plans and the related tax benefits partially offset by tax withholdings that we remitted on behalf of 

employees who have elected to have shares withheld by us to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise and vesting of their sharebased awards 

financing arrangements 

  

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 



fixed rate debt comprised 751  and 597  of total debt at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in fixed rate borrowings as of december 31 2016 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the issuance of the 2026 notes and the decrease in variable rate borrowings under our senior credit facility 

former senior credit facility 

at december 31 2016  we had 2100 million  in borrowings outstanding and approximately 32 million  in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 850 million revolving credit facility which was made available to us under a senior credit agreement this facility which was replaced with an increased revolving credit facility under the amended and restated credit agreement described below was used principally for working capital needs and at certain times to help fund acquisitions see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our former senior credit facility 

amended and restated senior credit facility 

on january 20 2017 the “effective date” we amended and restated our thenexisting senior credit agreement by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement “2017 credit agreement” the 2017 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear revolving credit facility of 10 billion and a term loan facility of 7500 million the term loan facility and borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance the acquisition of vascular solutions the obligations under the 2017 credit agreement are guaranteed subject to certain exceptions and limitations by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a lien on substantially all of our and each guarantors owned assets the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility will mature on january 20 2022 and february 17 2022 respectively 

the 2017 credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that among other things and subject to certain exceptions qualifications and thresholds place limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness create additional liens enter into a merger consolidation or amalgamation dispose of certain assets make certain investments or acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements additionally the 2017 credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio generally the ratio of consolidated total funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the 2017 credit agreement of not more than 450 to 1 a secured leverage ratio generally the ratio of consolidated senior secured funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the 2017 credit agreement of not 

more than 350 to 1 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense each as defined in the 2017 credit agreement of not less than 350 to 1 in each case for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or most recently ended prior to the determination date and calculated in accordance with the definitions and methodologies set forth in the 2017 credit agreement 

see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding this new credit facility 

2024 and 2026 notes 

as of december 31 2016 the outstanding principal of the 2024 notes and 2026 notes were 2500 million and 4000 million respectively the indenture governing the 2024 and 2026 notes contains covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions and pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock subject to specified conditions the obligations under the 2024 and 2026 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our existing and future 100 owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under our senior credit agreement and by certain of our other 100 owned domestic subsidiaries as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all of the terms of our 2024 and 2026 notes 

convertible notes 

our convertible notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method we must calculate the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the convertible notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period at the time we issued the convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together were designed to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes by in effect increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes from our economic standpoint to 7465 however under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap” since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is antidilutive we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 

under the treasury stock method changes in the price per share of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation although the impact of such potential changes has been substantially reduced as a result of our repurchase of 3109 million principal amount of convertible notes in the exchange transactions and aggregate conversions totaling 448 million principal amount of convertible notes through february 13 2017 as described below the following table illustrates how based on the 443 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding as of february 13 2017 changes in our stock price would affect i the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes ii the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants subject to the warrant agreements iii the number of additional shares deemed outstanding with respect to the convertible notes after applying the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share total treasury stock method incremental shares iv the number of shares of common stock deliverable to us upon settlement of the hedge agreements and v the number of shares issuable upon concurrent conversion of the convertible notes exercise of the warrants and settlement of the convertible note hedge agreements 



 

our convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including in any fiscal quarter following an immediately preceding fiscal quarter in which the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter exceeds 130 of the conversion price of the convertible notes approximately 7972 since the fourth quarter of 2013 and in all subsequent periods through december 31 2016  the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded the established 130 threshold moreover commencing on may 1 2017 and through july 28 2017 the convertible notes are convertible regardless of our stock price the convertible notes will mature in august 2017 in april 2016 and january 2017 as described above in this liquidity and capital resources section we exchanged cash and common stock for 3109 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes in the exchange transactions 

accounts receivable securitization 

we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 500 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2016  we borrowed the maximum amount available of 500 million  under this facility this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred as of december 31 2015  we had 433 million  of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

  

for additional information regarding our indebtedness see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

contractual obligations   

contractual obligations at december 31 2016  are as follows 



 2 purchase and other obligations are defined as an unconditional commitment to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including quantities to be purchased price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the amounts include commitments for inventory purchases and capital expenditures that do not exceed our projected requirements in the normal course of business penalties due upon cancellation of cancellable agreements and excludes operating lease obligations the table was amended in 2016 to include purchases orders open at december 31 2016 

we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 175 million  and 404 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made and as a result these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of 71 million  and 208 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively of which 06 million  and 73 million as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

see notes 10 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions 

  

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for trade accounts receivable based on the companys historical collection experience and expected collectability of accounts receivable considering the length of time an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy 

of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 86 million  and 80 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively which constituted 30  and 29  of gross trade accounts receivable at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

in light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years we have measures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customerbycustomer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts such measures include monthly credit control committee meetings at which customer credit risks are identified after review of among other things accounts that exceed specified credit limits payment delinquencies and other customer issues in addition with respect to certain of our nongovernment customers we have instituted measures designed to reduce our risk exposures including reducing credit limits and requiring that payments accompany orders with respect to government customers we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices some of our customers particularly in greece italy spain and portugal have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain additional allowances may be required in future periods 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

  

we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim distributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information when necessary we adjust the reserves with a corresponding adjustment to revenue to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 116 million  and 111 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively we expect amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31 2016  to be paid within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

inventory utilization 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage 

our inventory reserve was 364 million  and 365 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively which represents 103  and 100 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

accounting for longlived assets 

  

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable for example such an assessment may be initiated if as a result of a change in expectations we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of 

significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets include indefinitelived assets such as goodwill certain trade names and inprocess research and development iprd as well as finitelived intangibles such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives customer relationships intellectual property and distribution rights the costs of finitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily certain trade names are not amortized we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows which are key elements in determining fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

goodwill 

  

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment we have a total of ten reporting units nine of which have goodwill in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test described below alternatively we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the twostep quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis in the fourth quarter 2016 we performed a qualitative assessment on six of our reporting units and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not higher than its carrying value and therefore concluded that goodwill was not impaired for the three remaining reporting units whose assets included goodwill we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the twostep quantitative impairment test 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value in performing the first step we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which we determine in the second step of the twostep test the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 discount rates 

that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2016  as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in 2015 the discount rate was 100 for all reporting units a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting units carrying value to exceed its fair value while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline in this regard if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges moreover changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value in which case we also may incur material impairment charges 

no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2016  

other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test in the fourth quarter 2016  we performed a qualitative assessment on one of our indefinite lived assets and determined that its fair value was more likely than not higher than its carrying value for the remaining four indefinitelived intangible assets we elected to test impairment through the quantitative method 

in connection with the quantitative impairment test since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize several present value techniques to estimate fair value the fair value of trade names and iprd is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method a form of income approach that values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the value of the hypothetical royalty which is based on the estimated royalty rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management must estimate the volume of sales hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and terminal growth rate to estimate the hypothetical royalty associated with the asset 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the trade names during the fourth quarter 2016  are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill and we assumed a royalty rate of 4  discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the intangible asset assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trade names are being licensed in the marketplace 

no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual trade name impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2016  for the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized a pretax iprd impairment charge of 410 

million see restructuring and other impairment charges within the result of operations above as well as note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on this charge 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including under plans that provide pension and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

  



for additional information on assumptions pertaining to pension and other postretirement benefit plans refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

sharebased compensation 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option share based compensation expense for 2016  2015  and 2014  was 169 million  145 million  and 122 million  respectively 

accounting for contingent consideration liabilities 

  

in connection with an acquisition we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay the fair value of the contingent consideration liability at december 31 2016 is calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level 3 measurement we remeasure this liability each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilitys fair value in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income an increase or decrease in the fair value can result from changes in the estimated sales royalties and the discount rate as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we accrued 71 million  and 208 million  of contingent consideration respectively for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we recorded reductions to contingent consideration of 83 million  44 million  and 82 million  respectively resulting from changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory and sales milestones 

accounting for income taxes 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities management must among other things make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final united states and foreign tax settlements changes in tax law and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1045 million  and 1035 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment we are currently under examination by the canadian tax authorities with respect to our income tax returns for various tax years the ultimate outcome of the examination could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results 

see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions 

new accounting standards 

  

see note 2  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards including estimated effects if any of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt 

obligations variable interest rates on december 31 2016  were determined using a base rate of the onemonth libor rate plus the applicable spread 



a change of 10 in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately 16 million  based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2016  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we enter into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge the risk associated with these exposures these contracts generally involve the purchase or sale at designated future dates of specified amounts of a foreign currency while simultaneously committing to an opposite way sale or purchase of a specified amount of us dollars or euros based on the exchange rate at the time of entry into the contract the contracts we enter into to hedge transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies are designated as cash flow hedges the contracts to hedge monetary asset and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the accounting treatment of designated and nondesignated hedge contracts 

the following table provides information regarding our open foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2016  which mature during 2017  as of december 31 2016  the total notional amount for the designated and nondesignated contracts expressed in us dollars is 1018 million  and 734 million  respectively as of december 31 2015 the total notional amount for the designated and nondesignated contracts expressed in us dollars is 495 million and 691 million respectively forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies

business 

tableend teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we manufacture our products at 25  manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the united states 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth and improving our financial performance by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 

 our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to bring cost effective innovative products to market that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing these products for both existing and new therapeutic applications as well as enhancements to and line extensions of existing products we introduced 20  new products and line extensions during 2015  our portfolio of existing products and products under development consists primarily of class i and class ii devices which require 510k clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda for sale in the united states we believe that 510k clearance reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii devices see government regulation below 

our segments 

effective april 1 2015 we reorganized certain of our north american businesses to better leverage our resources as a result we realigned our operating segments specifically our anesthesiarespiratory north america operating segment was divided into two operating segments anesthesia north america and respiratory north america additionally the businesses comprising our former specialty operating segment which was not a reportable segment and therefore was included in the all other category in our presentation of segment information were transferred to the anesthesia north america vascular north america and respiratory north america operating segments

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we expanded and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

beginning in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our other businesses which served the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we became exclusively a medical device company 

we expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives in recent years we expanded our product portfolio through select acquisitions including our 2012 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma international nv a global provider of laryngeal masks whose products are used in anesthesia and emergency care which complements our anesthesia product portfolio and our 2013 acquisition of vidacare corporation vidacare a provider of intraosseous or inside the bone access devices which complements our vascular access and anesthesia product portfolios we continue to complete conversions from distributor sales to direct sales distributortodirect sales conversions in certain countries including australia korea and japan additionally we continue to execute restructuring programs to improve efficiencies in our sales and marketing and research and development structures and in our manufacturing and distribution facilities 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the united states 

all of our medical devices manufactured or sold in the united states are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” as implemented and enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling storage record keeping clearance approval advertising and promotion distribution postmarket surveillance import and export of our medical devices 

unless an exemption or preamendment grandfather status applies each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance as a class i or class ii device by submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval as a class iii device by filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed 510kcleared device or preamendment device for which fda has not called for pmas referred to as the predicate device substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has 

been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process the process for approval when no substantially equivalent device exists if the fda agrees it is a low to moderate risk device eligible for class i or class ii designation a device not eligible for 510k clearance or de novo clearance is categorized as class iii and must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k process it generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i and class ii devices that require 510k clearance in addition modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k clearance the sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s investigational device exemption “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board irb which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve require modifications in or disapprove research to protect the rights safety and welfare of the human research subject the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients an irb may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or may impose other conditions 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply those regulatory requirements include the following 

 in september 2013 the fda issued final regulations and draft guidance documents regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which will require manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers while the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it will require us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements having taken effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2020 

certain of our medical devices are sold in convenience kits that include a drug component such as lidocaine these types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the center for devices and radiological health under the device regulations because the device generates the primary mode of action of the kit although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices “cgmps” to the extent applicable to the drugcomponent repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cgmps as well as other regulatory requirements 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections to verify compliance with the qsr as well as other regulatory requirements if the fda were to find that 

we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

regulation of medical devices outside of the united states 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the united states in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the united states targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the united states that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

we are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry recent rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members the reported data is available to the public on the cms website failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the united state that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonunited states government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the united states we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the united states government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees distributors or other agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness our major competitors include c r bard inc medtronic plc and becton dickinson and company 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly aluminum steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and our efforts to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures our research and development expenditures were 521 million  610 million  and 650 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products historically we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors 

employees 

we employed approximately 12200  fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2015  of these employees approximately 2900  were employed in the united states and 9300  in countries other than the united states approximately 4  percent of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collectivebargaining arrangements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

environmental 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the united states our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes while we continue to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows further we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or stock price the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products due to among other things our inability to 

 in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement or the reduction in reimbursement levels for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly in some countries medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets regardless of the extent of their patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by reducing customers’ selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including facility consolidations organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce while we have realized some efficiencies from these actions we may not realize the benefits of these initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may be compelled to undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our other strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning or erp systems for example between 2012 and 2013 we migrated our arrow business from a separate erp system to our principal erp system to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives however as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern among other things the development design approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k or de novo clearance or approval of a premarket approval application or pma from the fda similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign governmental authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 

 16 

 we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated promoting a device for an offlabel use or making misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation which requires periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation in addition any facilities assembling convenience kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

 if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” imposed annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals our first report was submitted in 2014 and the reported information was made publicly available in a searchable format in september 2014 in addition device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california connecticut nevada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims as well as product recalls any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore as a medical device company our reputation may be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death in addition in connection with the divestitures of our former nonmedical businesses we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to those businesses which include among other things liability for products manufactured prior to the date on which we completed the sale of the business product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the related legal defense costs may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by regulatory authorities to participate in a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could harm our reputation decrease demand for our products lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets   combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred in recent years led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending resulting in reductions delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services and continues to cause disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

additionally our customers particularly in the european region have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided which has increased our focus on collectability with respect to our accounts receivable 

from these customers to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional operating needs however the ongoing uncertainty in the european financial markets combined with a continuation of constrained european credit markets creates a risk that some of our european customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity as of december 31 2015  and 2014  our net current and long term accounts receivable in italy spain portugal and greece were 623 million  and 762 million  respectively in 2015  2014  and 2013  net revenues from these countries were approximately 7  8  and 8  of total net revenues respectively and average days that accounts receivable from these countries were outstanding were 204  223  and 260  days respectively although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than we originally anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges and other issues that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including issues related to internal control over financial reporting regulatory compliance and shortterm effects of increased costs on results of operations although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the united states pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the affordable care act 

 19 

 in 2015  2014  and 2013 we recorded expenses of 102 million  127 million  and 115 million  respectively with respect to the medical device excise tax while the excise tax has been suspended in 2016 and 2017 unless the suspension is extended we will again be subject to the excise tax in 2018 we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonunited states operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the united states including canada belgium the czech republic france germany ireland malaysia mexico and singapore as of december 31 2015 76  of our fulltime and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states as of december 31 2015  2014 and 2013 approximately 43  45 and 37 respectively of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states in addition for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 47  50 and 50 respectively of our net revenues based on the teleflex facility generating the sale were derived from operations outside the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states including 

 in addition the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonunited states jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonunited states officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded united states corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees distributors or other agents in addition we may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we may acquire violations of antibribery laws or allegations of such violations could 

disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also could be subject to severe penalties including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in united states government contracts 

the risks relating to our foreign operations may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates products manufactured in and sold into foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonunited states currencies to united states dollars our reporting currency as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities as well as transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates which we refer to as nonfunctional currencies when the united states dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our united states dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum and steel increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers and thus adversely affect their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need in addition our borrowing costs could be adversely affected if interest rates increase any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortages unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors including 

 our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

research and development for some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development and use of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and as a result no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the united states we cannot assure that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their 

confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop knowhow and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be required to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business 

we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  we had total consolidated indebtedness of 1066 million  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

 if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

 23 

we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our revolving credit agreement and the indenture governing our 525 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to among other things 

 in addition our revolving credit agreement also contains financial covenants including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit agreement a breach of any covenants under any one or more of these debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

the contingent conversion features of our convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2010 we issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the “convertible notes” the convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including the attainment of a last reported sale price per share of our common stock equal to 130 of the conversion price approximately 7972 for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter because our closing stock price has exceeded the 130 threshold since the fourth quarter 2013 the convertible notes are currently convertible into shares of our common stock as a result the convertible notes are classified as a current liability which in turn has resulted in a material reduction of our net working capital as of february 15 2016 we have received conversion notices with respect to approximately 447 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes at this time we have elected the net settlement method to satisfy the conversion obligation under which we will settle the principal amount of the convertible notes converted in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amount due through a combination of our existing cash on hand amounts available under our credit facility and if necessary amounts provided through the capital markets our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the convertible notes 

the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may adversely affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with two counterparties which we refer to as the hedge counterparties the hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the convertible notes and are expected to reduce the dilution with respect to our common stock andor cash payments that we may be required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock with the hedge counterparties with an exercise price of 7465 subject to customary antidilution adjustments pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue shares of our common stock the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or if we so elect obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants in addition under applicable accounting guidance changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation with respect to the convertible notes and warrants which in turn could impact our reported financial results based on the average market price of our common stock during 2015  27 million  shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants were included in the total diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2015  for additional information see “financing arrangements” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k 

in connection with establishing their positions under the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates entered into various cashsettled overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the convertible notes the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates may in their sole discretion with or without notice modify their hedge positions from time to time and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to the conversion of the convertible notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution and we will be subject to the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of each hedge counterparty is not secured by any collateral if a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by a hedge counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes which could lower the price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2015  we had outstanding approximately 416 million  shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 14 million  shares of our common stock of which approximately 08 million  were vested as of that date restricted stock units covering approximately 03 million  shares of our common stock which are expected to vest over the next three years and approximately 14000  shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan as of december 31 2015  199 million  shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options upon conversion of the convertible notes and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore our issuance of shares following the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options and warrants the vested of restricted stock units and the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock including common stock issued as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants vesting of restricted stock units or conversion of the convertible notes could depress the price of our common stock 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur expenses or lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business 

in 2012 the sec promulgated rules under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and if so whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc or an adjoining country we filed conflict minerals report in june 2014 and june 2015 as discussed in the most recent report we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we have undertaken and continue to undertake efforts to identify where such minerals originated we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups due to among other things our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all moreover we may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting customer demands that we provide drc conflict free products we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 26 

these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2015  approximately 4  of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements in addition for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 7  of our net revenues were generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings compliance with debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our convertible notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the convertible notes and the indentures governing the convertible notes and the 2024 notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if an acquisition event constitutes a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash similarly if an acquisition event constitutes a “change of control” as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 notes holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in addition if an acquisition event constitutes a “makewhole fundamental change” as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes we may be required under certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such acquisition event in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible notes and the 2024 notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies 

we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives based on our evaluation we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that do not meet our objectives in addition we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position 

on february 23 2016 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan that involves the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce we estimate that we will incur aggregate pretax charges in connection with these restructuring activities of approximately 34 million to 44 million of which we expect approximately 21 million to 23 million to be incurred in 2016 and most of the balance will be incurred prior to the end of 2018 we estimate that 27 million to 31 million of the aggregate pretax charges will result in future cash outlays of which we expect approximately 6 million to 8 million will be made in 2016 and most of the balance will be made prior to the end of 2018 additionally we expect to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately 13 million to 17 million of which 3 million to 5 million will be made in 2016 we currently expect to achieve annualized savings of 12 million to 16 million once the plan is fully implemented and currently expect to realize planrelated savings beginning in 2017 see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

for a discussion of our ongoing restructuring programs see restructuring and other impairment charges under “results of operations” below 

during 2015 we completed several acquisitions of businesses that complement our anesthesia surgical and vascular product portfolios as well as our asia segment in 2014 we completed acquisitions of businesses to complement our asia segment and our surgical product portfolio the total fair value of consideration for the 2015 and 2014 acquisitions was 965 million  and 663 million respectively see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the acquisitions 

change in reporting segments 

effective april 1 2015 we reorganized certain of our businesses to better leverage our resources as a result we realigned our operating segments specifically the anesthesiarespiratory north america operating segment was divided into two operating segments anesthesia north america and respiratory north america additionally the businesses comprising the former specialty operating segment which was not a reportable segment and therefore was included in the all other category in the presentation of segment information were transferred to the anesthesia north america vascular north america and respiratory north america operating segments as a result of the operating segment changes described above we have the following six reportable operating segments vascular north america anesthesia north america surgical north america emea asia and oem in connection with the presentation of segment information we will continue to present certain operating segments which effective april 1 2015 include among others the respiratory north america operating segment in the “all other” category all prior comparative periods have been restated to reflect these changes additionally because this change affected our reporting units we performed goodwill impairment analyses as of the april 1 2015 effective date for the new reporting units by comparing the fair value of the reporting units including goodwill to their carrying values the impairment analyses performed included the reallocation of the goodwill balances among the reporting units to reflect the changes described above we did not record any goodwill impairment charges as a result of these analyses 

health care reform 

in 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the affordable care act was signed into law the legislation is farreaching and is intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality and reduce the costs of healthcare for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but the provisions of the legislation designed to contain the cost of healthcare could negatively affect pricing of our products and encourages patient outcome driven results the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage statistics patient outcomes and patient satisfaction 

in addition the affordable care act imposed a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices beginning in 2013 for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013 we recorded medical device excise taxes of 102 million  127 million  and 115 million  respectively which is included are selling general and administrative expenses as a result of the enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 the excise tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions in recent years have had adverse impacts on market activities including among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities although on a consolidated basis the consequences of economic conditions other than fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity 

in recent years hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures consequently hospitals took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending more recently the economic environment has improved somewhat but has not returned to prerecession levels and challenges persist particularly in some european countries as discussed below approximately 95  of our net revenues come from singleuse products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change conversely our sales volume could be positively impacted due to increases in the number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered 

europe continues to contend with considerable government debt and annual deficits high levels of unemployment and the risk of deflation these factors have resulted in austerity programs that have affected the healthcare sector in a number of european countries resulting in delays in elective surgeries it is likely that funding for publicly funded healthcare institutions will continue to be affected if governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which has resulted in a slowdown in payments to us the slowdown has continued to affect the timing of collections from these customers 

in asia governments are making additional efforts to manage the cost of healthcare as economic conditions weaken somewhat in the region as a result of slowing growth rates in china we are experiencing an increasing trend of government driven price management and reimbursement controls particularly in china japan and indonesia in china there is also a governmental initiative to help local manufacturers access a bigger share of the local market moreover many countries including china have become more proactive with respect to regulatory requirements and as a result we expect longer more costly and more complicated regulatory approval processes in these countries 

in latin america some highly regulated economies such as argentina and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices although latin america does not represent a significant portion of our business our operations in this region may be adversely affected by these factors 

results of operations 

as used in this discussion new products are products that we have sold for 36 months or less and “existing products” are products that we have sold for more than 36 months discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects for the first 12 months following the acquisition of a distributor the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from the elimination of the distributor from the sales channel to the extent an acquired distributor had preacquisition sales of products other than ours the impact of the postacquisition sales of those products on our results of operations is included within our discussion of the impact of acquired businesses 

certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis which may cause minor differences 

revenues 

  



comparison of 2015   and 2014 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased 16  or 301 million  compared to the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of 1291 million primarily in the emea and asia segments the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by a net increase in sales volumes of existing products in most of our segments of 519 million and a net increase in new product sales in most of our segments of 194 million in addition the decrease was further offset by sales by acquired businesses primarily human medics co ltd “human medics” a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the korean market minilap a developer of microlaparoscopic instrumentation mayo healthcare pty limited mayo healthcare a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the australian market n stenning  co pty ltd stenning a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the australian market and truphatek holdings 1993 limited truphatek a manufacturer of a broad range of disposable and reusable laryngoscope devices which generated 148 million and net price increases primarily in the asia and surgical north america segments which generated 128 million 

comparison of 2014   and 2013 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 85  or 1435 million  compared to the prior year the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to the businesses acquired during 2013 and 2014 including vidacare mayo healthcare and ultimate medical pty ltd and its affiliates collectively ultimate a supplier of airway management devices which generated net revenues of 986 million including 799 million 166 million and 22 million generated by vidacare mayo healthcare and ultimate respectively net revenues further benefited from price increases of 239 million primarily in the asia emea and surgical north america segments new product sales of 148 million across most of our segments and a net increase in sales volumes of existing products of 123 million primarily in the oem emea and vascular north america segments these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 62 million lower sales volumes in the asia segment as well as in certain of the operating segments included in the all other category and price reductions in the oem segment 

gross profit 



comparison of 2015 and 2014 

for the year ended december 31 2015 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 100 basis points or 20 compared to the prior year the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to the 70 basis point impact of a net increase in sales of higher margin products primarily in the surgical north america and oem segments the 60 basis point impact of a net increase in sales volumes of existing products primarily in the vascular north america emea and asia segments and the 30 basis point impact of net price increases primarily in the asia and surgical north america segments gross margin was negatively impacted by the 80 basis point impact of net unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and costs associated with product recalls and quality issues first identified during the second quarter 2015 partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from cost improvement initiatives   

comparison of 2014   and 2013 

for the year ended december 31 2014 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 170 basis points or 34 compared to the prior year the increase in gross margin is primarily due to increased sales from higher margin vidacare products margin increases in asia resulting from sales of mayo healthcare products price increases in asia emea and surgical north america and increased sales of higher margin products primarily in the emea and certain of the operating segments included in the all other category these improvements in gross profit were partially offset by costs associated with the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan an increase in logistics and distribution costs and the net unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

selling general and administrative 

  



comparison of 2015 and 2014 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 97 million during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the prior year the decrease is due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of 285 million and a reduction in medical device excise tax of 25 million these declines were partially offset by expenses associated with the 2015 acquisitions and distributorstodirect sales conversions of 114 million an increase in selling expenses of 54 million primarily related to higher sales commissions a reduction in the benefit resulting from contingent consideration liability reversals of 29 million and higher amortization expense of 26 million 

comparison of 2014 and 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 765 million  during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to 354 million of expenses associated with acquired businesses primarily vidacare mayo healthcare and ultimate 138 million of higher sales expense primarily related to an increase in sales commissions higher amortization expense of 105 million the majority of which relates to the amortization of vidacare intangibles 54 million of higher general and administrative costs primarily due to increases in employee related expenses higher depreciation expense of 22 million resulting from a reduction in the estimated useful life of an administrative building and certain related assets 17 million of higher it related costs primarily associated with the ongoing maintenance of enterprise resource planning software systems partially offset by the 32 

million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which caused a reduction of expenses in addition the benefit from contingent consideration reserve reductions for the year ended december 31 2014 was 49 million lower than the benefit realized in the year ended december 31 2013 

research and development 



comparison of 2015   and 2014 

the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2015 resulted from efficiencies realized through our integration of research and development projects commenced by certain businesses acquired in 2013 that were reflected in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 the decrease is also attributable to the late stage technology acquisitions made in 2015 which supplement our organic research and development initiatives 

comparison of 2014 and 2013 

the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 resulted from efficiencies realized through our integration of research and development projects commenced by certain businesses acquired in 2012 including lma international nv hotspur technologies and semprus biosciences corp that were reflected in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 

restructuring and other impairment charges

for the year ended december 31 2015 expenses related to the 2014 manufacturing footprint realignment plan decreased 30 million as compared to the prior year the decrease was attributable to lower restructuring costs primarily termination benefits of 76 million as shown above which was partially offset by an increase in charges recorded to cost of sales primarily for the transfer of manufacturing operations from the existing locations to the new locations of 46 million in addition for the year ended december 31 2015 we incurred 78 million of capital expenditures and had cash outlays of 106 million of which 27 million  related termination benefit payments associated with this plan as of december 31 2015  we had a reserve of 74 million in connection with this plan the majority of which is recorded as a current liability

interest expense   



  

the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the prior year reflects the benefit of the redemption on june 1 2015 of our 6875 senior subordinated notes due 2019 which had a fixed interest rate proceeds from our revolving credit facility which bear a lower variable interest rate were utilized to redeem the 2019 notes 

the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year was the result of an increase of 96 million in average outstanding debt and an increase of 18 basis points in the average interest rate on outstanding debt during 2014 

loss on extinguishment of debt   



  

on june 1 2015 we prepaid the 250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount under our 6875 senior subordinated notes due 2019 the “2019 notes” in addition to our prepayment of principal we paid to the holders of the 2019 notes an 86 million prepayment makewhole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest we recorded the prepayment makewhole amount and a 19 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends taxes scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

approximately 1474 million  of our 3034 million  of net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was generated in the united states and approximately 1186 million  of our 2902 million  of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was generated in the united states of our 3384 million  of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015 3160 million  was held at foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and subject to cash payment of additional united states income taxes or foreign withholding taxes these funds could be repatriated if necessary any additional taxes could be offset at least in part by foreign tax credits the amount of any taxes required to be paid which could be significant and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense because taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested 

we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated operating needs however as discussed above in global economic conditions although there have been recent improvements in certain countries global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity consequently we continue to monitor our credit risk particularly with respect to customers in europe as of december 31 2015  and 2014 our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in italy spain portugal and greece were 374 million  and 469 million  respectively for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  net revenues from customers in these countries were approximately 7  8  and 8  respectively of total net revenues and average days that current and longterm accounts receivable were outstanding were 204  223  and 260  days respectively as of december 31 2015  and 2014  net current and longterm accounts receivable from these countries were approximately 24  and 27  respectively of our consolidated net current and longterm accounts receivable if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries moreover if global economic conditions generally deteriorate we may experience further delays in customer payments reductions in our customers’ purchases and higher credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2016 and future years see critical accounting policies and estimates below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable 

the aggregate total fair value of consideration for the acquisitions we made in 2015 and 2014 was 965 million  and 663 million  respectively see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

during 2015 we prepaid the 250 million aggregate principal outstanding on our 6875 senior subordinated notes due 2019 the 2019 notes but increased the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and securitization program by 196 million and 386 million respectively during 2014 we issued 250 million of 525 

senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes and used the 2450 million net proceeds of the sale of the 2024 notes to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility we pay interest on the 2024 notes semiannually on june 15 and december 15 at a rate of 525 per year see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our borrowings 

we have no scheduled principal payments under our borrowings until 2017 we anticipate our aggregate domestic interest payments on our borrowings for 2016  will approximate 393 million we plan to utilize cash from operations generated from both in and outside of the united states and our revolving credit facility to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements 

our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the convertible notes are classified as a current liability because a conversion event related to the achievement of a specified market price threshold with respect to our common stock has occurred and is continuing 

we may at any time from time to time repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases or by tender at any price or in privately negotiated transactions exchange transactions or otherwise such purchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 3034 million  during 2015 compared to 2902 million  during 2014 the 132 million  increase is primarily due to improved operating results partially offset by an increase in contributions to pension plans of 33 million an increase in income tax payments net of refunds of 32 million an increase in payments associated with restructuring programs and other unfavorable working capital items 

the net cash outflow from the other working capital items is primarily the result of cash outflows for inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a cash inflow for accounts receivable the net cash outflow for the purchase of inventories was 84 million in 2015 as compared to a 155 million net cash outflow in 2014 the reduction in the cash outflow is primarily due to service level improvements and the consolidation of distribution facilities associated with restructuring initiatives as well as fewer inventory builds in support of distributor to direct conversions the accounts payable and accrued expenses net cash outflow was 01 million in 2015 as compared to cash outflow of 98 million in 2014 the decrease in the cash outflow is primarily a result of the timing

the factors contributing to the increase in net cash flow from operating activities discussed above were partially offset by increased inventories of 155 million during 2014 as compared to an increase of 89 million in 2013 primarily due to increased inventory purchases to support sales growth internationally and our distributortodirect sales conversions in several countries and an 89 million increase in tax payments net of refunds in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to timing of tax payments and improved operating results

financing arrangements 

  

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 



  

fixed rate borrowings comprised 597  and 815  of total borrowings at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the reduction in fixed rate borrowings as of december 31 2015 compared to the prior year is primarily due to our redemption of the 2019 notes and the increase in variable rate borrowings under our senior credit facility 

our senior credit agreement which relates to our 850 million revolving credit facility contains covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio generally the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not more than 401 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than 3501 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated in accordance with the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement and during the six month period prior to the maturity of our convertible notes a minimum liquidity of 4000 million at december 31 2015  our consolidated leverage ratio was 2431  and our interest coverage ratio was 9771  both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence the obligations under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed subject to certain exceptions by substantially all of the material domestic subsidiaries of the company and subject to certain exceptions and limitations secured by a pledge on substantially all of the equity interests owned by the company and each guarantor 

at december 31 2015  we had 3960 million  in borrowings outstanding and approximately 38 million  in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 850 million revolving credit facility this facility is used principally for working capital needs and at certain times to help fund acquisitions the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the 

covenants contained in our senior credit agreement moreover additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur notwithstanding these restrictions we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december 31 2015  we would have been permitted 6817 million  of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31 2015  moreover additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 

as of december 31 2015 the outstanding principal of the 2024 notes was 2500 million the indenture governing the 2024 notes contains covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions and pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock subject to specified conditions the obligations under the 2024 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our existing and future 100 owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under our senior credit agreement and by certain of our other 100 owned domestic subsidiaries 

as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior credit agreement and our 2024 notes 

our convertible notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method we must calculate the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the convertible notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period at the time we issued the convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes by in effect increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes from our economic standpoint to 7465 however under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap” since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is antidilutive we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 

under the treasury stock method changes in the price per share of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation the following table illustrates how changes in our stock price would affect i the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes ii the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants subject to the warrant agreements iii the number of additional shares deemed outstanding with respect to the convertible notes after applying the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share total treasury stock method incremental shares iv the number of shares of common stock deliverable to us upon settlement of the hedge agreements and v the number of shares issuable upon concurrent conversion of the convertible notes exercise of the warrants and settlement of the convertible note hedge agreements 



  

 

our convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including in any fiscal quarter following an immediately preceding fiscal quarter in which the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter exceeds 130 of the conversion price of the convertible notes approximately 7972 since the fourth quarter of 2013 and in all subsequent periods through december 31 2015 the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded the 130 threshold described above and accordingly the convertible notes are classified as a current liability as of december 31 2015  and 2014 the determination of whether or not the convertible notes are convertible under such circumstances is made each quarter until their maturity conversion or repurchase consequently the convertible notes may not be convertible in one or more future quarters if the common stock pricebased conversion contingency is not satisfied in such quarters in which case the convertible notes would again be classified as longterm debt unless another conversion event set forth in the convertible notes occurs as of february 15 2016 we have received conversion notices with respect to approximately 447 million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes we have elected a net settlement method to satisfy our conversion obligation under which we will settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facility our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity the classification of the convertible notes as a current liability had no impact on the financial covenants under our debt agreements 

in addition we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 500 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2015  the maximum amount available for borrowing under this facility was 67 million  this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility as of december 31 2015 we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had 433 million  and 47 million  respectively of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility

in effect on a particular date and the approximate timing of the transactions these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements 

we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 404 million  and 509 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments that will be required to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made and as a result these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

we recorded contingent consideration liabilities of 208 million  and 334 million  as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively of which 73 million  and 113 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively were recorded as the current portion of contingent consideration due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of future payments related to these liabilities these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 

in 2015  cash contributions to all of our defined benefit pension plans were 128 million  and we estimate the amount of required cash contributions in 2016  will be approximately 24 million  due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2016  and as a result these contributions are excluded from contractual obligations table shown above

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on the expected collectability of the accounts receivable considering our historical collection experience with respect to the customer length of time an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 80 million  and 88 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively which constituted 29  of gross accounts receivable at december 31 2015 and 2014 

in light of the volatility in global economic markets in recent years we have measures in place within countries where we have collectability concerns to facilitate customerbycustomer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts such measures include monthly credit control committee meetings at which customer credit risks are identified after review of among other things accounts that exceed specified credit limits payment delinquencies and other customer issues in addition with respect to certain of our nongovernment customers we have measures designed to reduce our risk exposures including reducing credit limits and requiring 

that payments accompany orders with respect to government customers we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices some of our customers particularly in europe have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers for the most part in greece italy spain and portugal if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain additional allowances may be required in future periods 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

  

we offer rebates to certain distributors and record a reserve with respect to the estimated amount of the rebates as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim distributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience and record the adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 111 million  and 104 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively we expect amounts subject to the reserve as of december 31 2015  to be paid within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

inventory utilization 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage 

our inventory reserve was 365 million  and 339 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively which represents 100  and 92 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

accounting for longlived assets 

  

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances which we refer to as triggering events indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable triggering events include a current expectation that more likely than not the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or an adverse change will occur in the business employing the related assets significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involves significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets include indefinitelived assets such as goodwill certain trade names or brands and inprocess research and development as well as finitelived intangibles such as trade names or brands that do not have indefinite 

lives customer relationships and intellectual property the costs of finitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets primarily certain trade names and trademarks are not amortized we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows which are key elements in determining fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

goodwill 

  

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment we have a total of ten reporting units nine of which have goodwill in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test described below alternatively we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the twostep impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis in the fourth quarter 2015 we performed a qualitative assessment on six of our reporting units and determined based on our assessment that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not higher than its carrying value and therefore concluded that goodwill was not impaired for the three remaining reporting units with goodwill we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and test each of those reporting units through the twostep quantitative impairment test 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its carrying value in performing the first step we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows dcf of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which we determine in the second step of the twostep test the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2015  as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in 2014 the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter of 2015  impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit the discount rate was 100 for all reporting units a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle under the income approach changes in assumptions could cause a reporting units carrying value to exceed its fair value while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline in this regard if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges 

no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2015 

other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of intellectual property customer relationships trade names and iprd management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test in the fourth quarter 2015 we performed a qualitative assessment on two of our indefinite lived assets and determined that their fair values were more likely than not higher than their carrying values for the remaining three indefinitelived intangible assets we elected to test impairment through the quantitative method 

in connection with the quantitative impairment test since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value the fair value of trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and terminal growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 

the fair value of iprd is estimated using a multiperiod excess earnings model which is a form of the income approach this model estimates fair value by using estimated cash flows to be derived from this technology the estimated cash flows are generated from a collection of assets including iprd but also including working capital fixed assets and other assets therefore the estimated cash flows generated by these other assets are deducted and the remaining amount the “excess earnings” are allocated to iprd key management judgments include making assumptions about the expected timing to complete the project future cash flows based on growth rates of revenue and expense expectations of erosion rates as a result of future replacement technology discount rates and working capital needs 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the trade names during the fourth quarter 2015  are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from the trade names ranged from 4  to 5  and a royalty rate of 4  was assumed the discount rate used to determine fair value of iprd was 165 discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the respective intangible assets assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trade names are being licensed in the marketplace 

no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual indefinitelived intangibles impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter 2015 for further details on the assessment of recoverability of finitelived intangible assets see accounting for longlived assets above 

in may 2012 we acquired semprus biosciences a biomedical research and development company that developed a polymer surface treatment technology intended to reduce thrombus related complications as previously disclosed we experienced difficulties with respect to the development of the semprus technology and were devoting further research and testing towards attempting to resolve the issue as a result of these efforts we believe we have resolved the issue and are focused on seeking regulatory approval and engaging in additional research and development efforts to achieve commercialization of this technology despite this progress significant challenges to commercialization of the semprus technology remain and we ultimately may find it necessary to recognize future impairment charges with respect to the related assets which could be material as of december 31 2015  we have recorded iprd intangible assets of 410 million  related to semprus 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors that are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

  



effective december 31 2015 the company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its pension and other postretirement benefits to provide a more precise estimate based on the spot rates that comprise the yield curve as of december 31 2015 the change in method is expected to result in a decrease in the service and interest cost components for 2016 when compared to the estimates determined using the prior methodology 

  

for additional information on assumptions pertaining to pension and other postretirement benefit plans refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

sharebased compensation 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option share based compensation expense for 2015  2014  and 2013  was 145 million  122 million  and 119 million  respectively 

      accounting for contingent consideration liabilities 

  

in connection with an acquisition we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay the fair value of the contingent consideration is calculated based on a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow analysis we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record the change in the liabilitys fair value in our consolidated statement of income an increase or decrease in the fair value can result from changes in the discount rate timing estimated probability of achievement of the specified objectives and revenue estimates among other factors as of december 31 2015  the range of undiscounted amounts the company could be required to pay under contingent consideration arrangements is between 70 million  and 438 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we accrued 208 million  and 334 million  of contingent consideration respectively for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we recorded reductions to contingent consideration of 44 million  82 million  and 123 million  respectively resulting from changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory and sales milestones 

accounting for income taxes 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final united states and foreign tax settlements changes in tax law and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 1035 million  and 991 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment we are currently under examination by the austrian canadian german and united states tax authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years the ultimate outcomes of the examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates on december 31 2015 were determined using a base rate of the onemonth libor rate plus the applicable spread 

  



  

 

a change of 10 in variable interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately 28 million  based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2015  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions as well as monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we enter into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge the risk associated with these exposures which are primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar or the euro the contracts entered into to hedge transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies are designated as cash flow hedges the contracts to hedge monetary asset and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are not designated as cash flow fair value or net investment hedges 

  the following table provides information regarding our open foreign currency forward contracts at december 31 2015 which mature during 2016  as of december 31 2015 the total notional amount for the designated and nondesignated contracts expressed in us dollars is 495 million  and 691 million  respectively forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies

latin america 

our latin america business generally engages in the same type of operations and serves the same type of end markets as the emea segment 

our markets 

we generally serve three endmarkets hospitals and healthcare providers medical device manufacturers and home care these markets are influenced by a number of factors including demographics utilization and reimbursement patterns the following charts depict the percentage of net revenues for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  derived from each of our end markets 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we have grown and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

beginning in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our other businesses which served the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets following the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we became exclusively a medical device company 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the united states 

all of our medical devices manufactured or sold in the united states are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” as implemented and enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling storage record keeping clearance approval advertising and promotion distribution postmarket surveillance import and export of our medical devices 

unless an exemption or preamendment grandfather status applies each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance as a class i or class ii device by submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval as a class iii device by filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed 510kcleared device or preamendment device for which fda has not called for pmas referred to as the predicate device substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process the process for approval when no substantially equivalent device exists if the fda agrees it is a low to moderate risk device eligible for class i or class ii designation a device not eligible for 510k clearance or de novo clearance is categorized as class iii and must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k process it generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i and class ii devices that require 510k clearance in addition modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k the sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s investigational device exemption “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board or irb which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve require modifications in or disapprove research to protect the rights safety and welfare of the human research subject the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients an irb may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or may impose other conditions 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply those regulatory requirements include the following 

 in september 2013 the fda issued final regulations and draft guidance documents regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which will require manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers while the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it will require us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements having taken effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2020 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections to verify compliance with the qsr as well as other regulatory requirements for example in march 2014 we received a warning letter from the fda alleging certain violations of the quality system regulation observed during a september 2013 inspection of our arlington heights illinois manufacturing facility fda’s concerns relate to failure to appropriately establish and maintain certain manufacturing corrective and preventive action and process validation procedures in may 2014 the fda returned to the arlington heights facility and reissued its inspectional observations from the march 2014 warning letter and also required that we report to the fda a field corrective action we took with respect to a product manufactured at our arlington heights facility which we did we have provided detailed responses and updates to the fda as to our corrective actions and continue to work to address the issues identified by the fda until the violations are corrected and those corrective actions are accepted and verified by fda’ s reinspection we may be subject to additional enforcement action by the fda additionally the warning letter states that requests for certificates to foreign governments related to products manufactured at the arlington heights facility will not be granted until the violations have been corrected 

certain of our medical devices are sold in convenience kits that include a drug component such as lidocaine these types of kits are generally regulated as combination products within the center for devices and radiological health under the device regulations because the device generates the primary mode of action of the kit although the kit as a whole is regulated as a medical device it may be subject to certain drug requirements such as current good manufacturing practices “cgmps” to the extent applicable to the drugcomponent repackaging activities and subject to inspection to verify compliance with cgmps as well as other regulatory requirements 

if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

regulation of medical devices outside of the united states 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the united states in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the united states targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the united states that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

we are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry recent rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members the reported data is available to the public on the cms website failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the united state that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonunited states government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the united states we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the united states government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees distributors or other agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness our major competitors include c r bard inc medtronic and carefusion 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces through independent representatives and through independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of revenues to be anticipated in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly aluminum steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and our efforts to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures our research and development expenditures were 610 million  650 million  and 563 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products historically we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors 

employees 

we employed approximately 11700  fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2014  of these employees approximately 3100  were employed in the united states and 8600  in countries other than the united states approximately 8  percent of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collectivebargaining arrangements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

environmental 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the united states our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes while we continue to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows further we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or stock price the risks below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as our inability to 

 in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement or the reduction in reimbursement levels for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly in some countries medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets regardless of the extent of their patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by reducing customers’ selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including the realignment of our north american organizational structure facility consolidations and reductions in our workforce while we have realized some efficiencies from these actions we may not realize the benefits of these initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may be compelled to undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our other strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning or erp systems for example between 2012 and 2013 we migrated our arrow business onto our principal erp system to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives however as we continue our efforts to further consolidate our erp systems we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern among other things the development design approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k or de novo clearance or approval of a premarket approval application or pma from the fda similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign governmental authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application 

failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 

 we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses promoting a device for an offlabel use could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation which requires periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation for example in march 2014 we received a warning letter from the fda with respect to our arlington heights illinois manufacturing facility for information regarding the warning letter see business  government regulation in item 1 of this report in addition any facilities assembling convenience kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

 if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “affordable care act” imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers our first report was submitted in 2014 and the reported information was made publicly available in a searchable format in september 2014 in addition device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california connecticut nevada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims as well as product recalls any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore as a medical device company our reputation may be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death in addition in connection with the divestitures of our former nonmedical businesses we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to those businesses which include among other things liability for products manufactured prior to the date on which we completed the sale of the business product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the related legal defense costs may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by regulatory authorities to participate in a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could harm our reputation decrease demand for our products lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets   combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred in recent years led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending resulting in reductions delays or canceled purchases of our products and services while recent economic indicators suggest improvement in the global economy we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors if the improvement in economic conditions does not continue our customers may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us 

additionally our customers particularly in the european region have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided which has increased our focus on collectability with respect to our accounts receivable from these customers to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional operating needs however in light of the ongoing volatility in the european financial markets combined with a continuation of constrained european credit markets there is a risk that our european customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity as of december 31 2014  and 2013  our net current and long term accounts receivable in italy spain portugal and greece were 762 million  and 979 million  respectively in 2014  2013  and 2012  net revenues from these countries were approximately 8  8  and 9  of total net revenues respectively and average days that accounts receivable from these countries were outstanding were 223  260  and 288  days respectively although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than we originally anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges and other issues that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including issues related to internal control over financial reporting regulatory compliance and shortterm effects of increased costs on results of operations although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the united states pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the affordable care act 

 in 2014  and 2013  we paid 127 million  and 115 million  respectively with respect to the medical device excise tax however we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonunited states operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the united states including canada belgium the czech republic france germany ireland malaysia mexico and singapore as of december 31 2014 73  of our fulltime and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states as of december 31 2014  2013 and 2012 approximately 45  37 and 39 respectively of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states in addition for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 approximately 50  50 and 49 respectively of our net revenues based on the teleflex facility generating the sale were derived from operations outside the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states including 

 in addition the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonunited states jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonunited states officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded united states corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with government entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees distributors or other agents in addition we may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we may acquire violations of antibribery laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also could be subject to severe penalties including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in united states government contracts 

the risks relating to our foreign operations may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates products manufactured in and sold into foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonunited states currencies to united states dollars our reporting currency as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies when the united states dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our united states dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum and steel increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers and thus adversely affect their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need in addition our borrowing costs could be adversely affected if interest rates increase any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect our results 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortages unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors including 

 our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

research and development for some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development and use of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the united states there is no guarantee that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be required to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business 

we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2014  we had total consolidated indebtedness of 1068 million  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

 if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

 we may not be able to affect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our 525 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes and our 6875 senior subordinated notes due 2019 the 2019 notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to among other things 

 25 

 in addition our revolving credit agreement also contains financial covenants including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit agreement a breach of any covenants under any one or more of these debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debts in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

the contingent conversion features of our convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2010 we issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the “convertible notes” the convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including the attainment of a last reported sale price per share of our common stock equal to 130 of the conversion price approximately 7972 for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter because our closing stock price has exceeded the 130 threshold in the fourth quarter of 2014 the convertible notes are currently convertible into shares of our common stock as a result the convertible notes are classified as a current liability which in turn has resulted in a material reduction of our net working capital at this time we have elected the net settlement method to satisfy the conversion obligation under which we will settle the principal amount of the convertible notes converted in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amount due through a combination of our existing cash on hand amounts available under our credit facility and if necessary amounts provided through the capital markets our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the convertible notes 

the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may adversely affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with two counterparties which we refer to as the hedge counterparties the hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the convertible notes and are expected to reduce the dilution with respect to our common stock andor cash payments that we may be required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock with the hedge counterparties with a strike price of 74648 subject to customary antidilution adjustments pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue shares of our common stock the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or if we so elect obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants in addition under applicable accounting guidance changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation with respect to the convertible notes and warrants which in turn could impact our reported financial results based on the average market price of our common stock during 2014  19 million  shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants were included in the total diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2014  for additional information see “financing arrangements” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k 

in connection with establishing their positions under the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates entered into various cashsettled overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the convertible notes the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates may in their sole discretion with or without notice modify their hedge positions from time to time and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to the conversion of the convertible notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution and we will be subject to the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of each hedge counterparty is not secured by any collateral if a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by a hedge counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes which could lower the price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2014  we had outstanding approximately 414 million  shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 12 million  shares of our common stock of which approximately 06 million  were vested as of that date approximately 03 million  of restricted stock awards which are expected to vest over the next three years and approximately 20000  shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan in addition as of december 31 2014  204 million  shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options upon conversion of the convertible notes and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options and warrants and the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock issuable upon any exercise of stock options or warrants or conversion of the convertible notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the issuance and sale including through exercise of stock options and warrants of substantial amounts of common stock or conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur expenses or lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business 

the sec has promulgated rules under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufactured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these rules require that we undertake due diligence efforts to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance armed conflict in the drc we filed our first conflict minerals report in june 2014 as discussed in the report we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we are in the process of attempting to identify where such minerals originated we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products in addition these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups due to among other things our inability to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or if we are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands we also may face reputational challenges if our due diligence efforts do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time in 2014  our costs related to compliance with or liabilities under these laws totaled 13 million  we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2014  approximately 8  of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collectivebargaining arrangements in addition for the fiscal year ended december 31 2014  approximately 7  of our net revenues were generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings compliance with debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our convertible notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the convertible notes and the indentures governing the convertible notes the 2024 notes and the 2019 notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if an acquisition event constitutes a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash similarly if an acquisition event constitutes a “change of control” as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 notes and the 2019 notes holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in addition if an acquisition event constitutes a “makewhole fundamental change” as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes we may be required under certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such acquisition event in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible notes the 2024 notes and the 2019 notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure 

effective january 1 2014 we realigned our operating segments due to changes in our internal financial reporting structure the north american vascular anesthesiarespiratory and surgical businesses which previously comprised much of the americas operating segment are now separate reportable segments as a result we now conduct our operations through six reportable segments vascular north america anesthesiarespiratory north america surgical north america emea asia and oem certain operating segments are not material and are therefore included in the all other line item in tabular presentations of segment information additionally we made changes to the allocation methodology for certain costs including manufacturing variances and research and development costs among the businesses to improve accountability which resulted in changes to the previously reported segment profitability all prior comparative periods have been restated to reflect these changes 

since we became exclusively a medical device company in 2011 we have continued to expand our presence in the medical technology industry through strategic acquisitions the following is a listing of the more significant acquisitions we completed in 2014 and 2013 

during 2014 we acquired 



during 2013 we acquired 





we may be required to pay contingent consideration in connection with some of the acquisitions listed above the amount of contingent consideration we ultimately will pay will be based upon the achievement of specified objectives including regulatory approvals sales targets and the passage of time for additional information on these acquisitions and the related contingent consideration arrangements see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

health care reform 

on march 23 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended the affordable care act was signed into law this legislation significantly impacts our business for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare which could negatively affect pricing of our products the overall impact of the affordable care act on our business is yet to be determined mainly due to uncertainties around future customer behaviors which we believe will be affected by reimbursement factors such as insurance coverage statistics patient outcomes and patient satisfaction 

in addition the affordable care act imposed a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices beginning in 2013 for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we paid medical device excise taxes of 127 million  and 115 million  respectively which is included in selling general and administrative expenses 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions in recent years have had adverse impacts on market activities including among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity reduced demand for products and services and significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities although on a consolidated basis the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last several years the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility particularly the euro could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our liquidity 

hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures consequently hospitals took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending more recently the economic environment has improved somewhat but has not returned to prerecession levels and challenges persist particularly in some european countries as discussed below approximately 94  of our net revenues come from singleuse products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change as a result of continuing higher than normal unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers conversely our sales volume could be positively impacted due to increases in the number of insured individuals as a result of the affordable care act which has had the effect of facilitating medical insurance coverage for many persons who previously were not covered 

europe continues to contend with considerable government debt and annual deficits high levels of unemployment and the risk of deflation these factors have resulted in austerity programs that have affected the healthcare sector in european countries these austerity programs have resulted in delays in elective surgeries in a number of countries and reductions in health budgets it is likely that funding for publicly funded healthcare institutions will continue to be affected if governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which has resulted in a slowdown in payments to us the slowdown has continued to affect the timing of collections from these customers 

in asia recovery from the global recession has varied by country china announced plans for major healthcare investment directed to second tier cities newer cities resulting from chinas urbanization of the north and west regions of the country and hospitals which may provide future growth opportunities for us despite these growth opportunities distributor sales to third parties slowed in 2014 particularly in china which could have an impact on this future growth additionally slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan is expected to limit growth in that market 

in latin america some highly regulated economies such as argentina and venezuela have experienced unusually high inflation rates and weakening currencies this has impacted the budgets of the public healthcare systems resulting in delays in the importation of medical devices although not a significant portion of our business our operations in this region may be impacted by these factors 

results of operations 

the following comparisons exclude the impact of discontinued operations see note 18  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for discussion of discontinued operations certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis which may cause minor differences 

revenues 

  



comparison of 2014   and 2013 

net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 increased 85  to 18398 million  from 16963 million  in the twelve months ended december 31 2013 the 1435 million  increase in net revenues is largely due to the businesses acquired during 2013 and 2014 which generated net revenues of 986 million including 799 million 166 million and 22 million generated by vidacare mayo healthcare and ultimate respectively net revenues further benefited from price increases of 239 million primarily in the asia emea and surgical north america segments new product sales of 148 million primarily in the emea anesthesiarespiratory north america vascular north america and asia segments and higher sales volume of 123 million primarily in the oem and emea segments these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 62 million lower sales volumes in anesthesiarespiratory north america and asia segments and price reductions in the oem segment 

comparison of 2013   and 2012 

net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 increased 94  to 16963 million  from 15510 million  in the twelve months ended december 31 2012 the 1453 million  increase in net revenues is largely due to the businesses acquired during 2012 and 2013 which generated net revenues of approximately 1211 million in 2013 including approximately 1103 million generated by the assets we acquired in 2012 from lma international nv referred to below as lma or the lma business net revenues further benefited from new products of 192 million primarily in the vascular north america anesthesiarespiratory north america emea and oem segments price increases of 152 million in the surgical north america vascular north america emea and asia segments higher sales volume of 93 million and 13 million in asia and emea respectively and the 57 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates these increases were partly offset by aggregate lower sales volume of 147 million primarily in anesthesiarespiratory north america surgical north america and vascular north america and lower oem sales volumes of 118 million primarily due to lower sales of catheters and performance fibers 

gross profit 

  



comparison of 2014   and 2013 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 170 basis points compared to the corresponding prior year period the increase is primarily due to increased sales from higher margin vidacare products margin increases in asia resulting from sales of mayo healthcare products price increases in asia emea and surgical north america and increased sales of higher margin new products primarily in the emea vascular north america and anesthesiarespiratory north america segments these improvements in gross profit were partially offset by higher raw materials and manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

comparison of 2013   and 2012 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 130 basis points compared to the corresponding prior year period the increase is principally due to the inclusion of higher margin sales from the lma and vidacare businesses price increases in surgical north america vascular north america emea and asia new products in vascular north america anesthesiarespiratory north america surgical north america emea and oem manufacturing efficiencies in emea and oem and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates these benefits were partly offset by higher warehousing and freight costs in vascular north america emea and asia and lower sales volumes in anesthesiarespiratory north america surgical north america vascular north america and oem in addition gross profit in the 2012 period was adversely affected by inventory writeoffs for excess slow moving and damaged product in asia 

selling general and administrative 

  



comparison of 2014 and 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 765 million  during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2013 the increase is primarily due to 354 million of expenses associated with acquired businesses primarily vidacare mayo healthcare and ultimate 138 million of higher sales expense primarily related to an increase in sales commissions higher amortization expense of 105 million the majority of which relates to the amortization of vidacare intangibles 54 million of higher general and administrative costs primarily due to increases in employee related expenses higher depreciation expense of 22 million resulting from a reduction in the estimated useful life of an administrative building and certain related assets 17 million of higher it related costs primarily associated with the ongoing maintenance of enterprise resource planning software systems partially offset by the 32 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which caused a reduction of expenses in addition the benefit from contingent consideration reserve reductions for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 was 49 million lower than the benefit realized in the twelve months ended december 31 2013 

comparison of 2013 and 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 477 million  during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012 the increase is largely due to 364 million of expenses associated with acquired businesses including 296 million in expenses associated with the lma business 115 million in excise taxes on the sale of medical devices imposed by the affordable care act higher employee related expenses 42 million in increased costs associated with the conversion of several of our locations to a new erp system acquisition costs of 32 million primarily related to the acquisition of vidacare 58 million of higher legal costs due to the accrual for loss contingencies to reflect litigation developments including a verdict against us with respect to a nonoperating joint venture and professional fees and a 11 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates the increases were partly offset by an aggregate of 123 million in reversals of contingent consideration related to the acquisitions of hotspur technologies inc hotspur 85 million semprus biosciences corp “semprus” 24 million and the assets of axiom technology partners llp “axiom” 14 million after determining that conditions for the payment of certain contingent consideration would not be satisfied selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 also reflected the loss of 76 million from foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into in connection with the acquisition of the lma business 

research and development 



comparison of 2014   and 2013 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 research and development expenses decreased 62 compared to the corresponding prior year period the decrease is primarily due to higher research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 resulting from new activity with respect to businesses acquired in 2012 as well as efficiencies obtained through integrating certain projects into our existing structure 

comparison of 2013 and 2012 

the increase in research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 as compared to the corresponding prior year period is primarily due to the new activity with respect to businesses acquired in 2012 

goodwill impairment 

in the first quarter of 2012 we changed our former north america reporting unit structure from a single reporting unit to five reporting units comprised of vascular anesthesiarespiratory cardiac surgical and specialty we allocated the assets and liabilities of our former north america segment among the new reporting units based on their respective operating activities and then allocated goodwill among the reporting units using a relative fair value approach as required by fasb accounting standards codification “asc” topic 350 

following this allocation we performed goodwill impairment tests on these new reporting units as a result of these tests we determined that three of the reporting units in our former north america segment were impaired and in the first quarter of 2012 we recorded aggregate goodwill impairment charges of 332 million consisting of 220 million in our vascular reporting unit 107 million in our anesthesiarespiratory reporting unit and 5 million in our cardiac reporting unit in the first quarter of 2012 

we did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends taxes scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 

to date we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs however as discussed above in global economic conditions although there have been recent improvements in certain countries global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity consequently we continue to monitor our credit risk particularly related to customers in europe as of december 31 2014  our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in italy spain portugal and greece were 469 million  compared to 631 million  as of december 31 2013  for the twelve months ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  net revenues from customers in these countries was approximately 8  8  and 9  respectively of total net revenues and average days that current and longterm accounts receivable were outstanding were 223  260  and 288  days respectively as of december 31 2014  and 2013  net current and longterm accounts receivables from these countries were approximately 27  and 31  respectively of our consolidated net current and longterm accounts receivables if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries moreover if global economic conditions generally deteriorate we may experience further delays in customer payments reductions in our customers’ purchases and higher credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2015 and future years see critical accounting estimates below for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable 

during 2014 we acquired mayo healthcare pty limited a distributor of medical devices and supplies primarily in the australian market which provides distribution for our asia segment additionally the acquisition of the assets of minilap technologies inc a developer of microlaparoscopic instrumentation provides new products for our surgical north america segment the aggregate total fair value of consideration for these acquisitions is estimated at 663 million  see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

during 2013 we completed the acquisitions of vidacare corporation and ultimate medical pty ltd whose products complement our vascular anesthesia and specialty product portfolios and eon surgical ltd whose technology complements the surgical product portfolio the aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions was 3070 million we funded these acquisitions through borrowings under our senior credit facility see note 3  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

during 2014 we issued 250 million of 525 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes and used the 2450 million net proceeds of the sale of the 2024 notes to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility we pay interest on the 2024 notes semiannually on june 15 and december 15 at a rate of 525 per year we incurred transaction fees of approximately 45 million including underwriters discounts and commissions in connection with the offering of the 2024 notes see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the notes 

during 2013 we refinanced our senior credit facility replacing our 3750 million term loan and 4000 million revolving credit facility with an 8500 million dollar revolving credit facility we used borrowings under the new revolving credit facility to pay down the 375 million principal on the term loan and to fund the related refinancing costs of 64 million the new 850 million senior credit facility bears interest at an applicable rate elected by us equal to either the “base rate” the greater of either the federal funds effective rate plus 05 the prime rate or one month libor plus 10 plus an applicable margin of 025 to 100 or a “libor rate” for the period corresponding to the applicable interest period of the borrowings plus an applicable margin of 125 to 200 as of december 31 2014  the interest rate on the 850 million senior credit facility was 192  comprised of the libor rate of 017 plus a spread of 175 

approximately 1186 million  of our 2902 million  of net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was generated in the united states and approximately 941 million of our 2313 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was generated in the united states of our 3032 million  of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2014 2746 million  was held at foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and subject to cash payment of additional united states income taxes or foreign withholding taxes these funds could be repatriated if necessary any additional taxes could be offset at least in part by foreign tax credits the amount of any taxes required to be paid which could be significant and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense as taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested 

we repatriated approximately 2371 million  and 670 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements 

we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until 2018 we anticipate our aggregate domestic interest payments under our senior credit facility our 2024 notes our 6875 senior subordinates notes due 2019 the 2019 notes and our accounts receivable securitization facility for 2015  will be approximately 518 million  we plan to utilize cash from operations generated from both in and outside of the united states and our revolving credit facility to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements

cash flows 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 



comparison of 2014  and 2013 

  

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 2902 million  during 2014 compared to 2313 million  during 2013 the 589 million  increase is primarily due to improved operating results and favorable net changes in working capital items principally reflecting changes in accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses and prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as an 80 million decrease in contributions to domestic pension plans accounts receivable decreased 94 million during 2014 as compared to a 13 million increase during 2013 primarily due to increased collections from the spanish and portuguese government and spanish regional health authorities in 2014 and increased collections in italy and greece due to government financing additionally there was an overall improvement in days receivables outstanding in 2014 accounts payable and accrued expenses increased 98 million in 2014 compared to an increase of 20 million in 2013 primarily due to timing of vendor and employee related benefit payments and increased compensation accruals in 2014 prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased 14 million in 2014 compared to an increase of 59 million in 2013 due to timing of payments of and reductions in insurance premiums as well as fewer insurance deposits and maintenance contract payments in 2014 

these favorable impacts to net cash flow from operating activities were partially offset by increased inventories of 155 million during 2014 as compared to an increase of 89 million in 2013 primarily due to increased inventory purchases to support sales growth internationally and our distributortodirect sales conversions in several countries and an 89 million increase in tax payments net of refunds in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to timing of tax payments and improved operating results

cash flow from financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was 2312 million  during 2013 during 2013 we refinanced our senior credit facility which was comprised of a 3750 million term loan and 4000 million revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new 8500 million senior credit facility consisting solely of a revolving credit facility we used borrowings under the new facility to repay the outstanding 3750 million term loan and to pay costs of 64 million associated with the refinancing during 2013 we borrowed an additional 2980 million under the revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of vidacare in addition net cash used in financing activities included dividend payments of 559 million contingent consideration payments of 170 million related to our acquisitions of vasonova inc “vasonova” axiom lma hotspur and the guided imaging business of mepy benelux bvba and payments to noncontrolling interest shareholders of 07 million these outflows were partially offset by 62 million net inflows resulting from share based compensation activity which included proceeds from the exercise and vesting of sharebased awards issued under our stock compensation plans and the related excess tax benefits partially offset by tax withholdings remitted by the company on behalf of employees who elect to have shares withheld by the company to satisfy their minimum tax withholding obligations arising from the exercise and vesting of their sharebased awards 

financing arrangements 

  

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 



  

fixed rate borrowings comprised 81  and 49  of total borrowings at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in fixed rate borrowings as of december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 is primarily due to the issuance of the 2024 notes in 2014 and the 2450 million repayment of variable rate borrowings under our senior credit facility 

our senior credit agreement contains covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio generally the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not more than 401 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than 3501 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated in accordance with the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement and during the six month period prior to the maturity of our convertible notes a minimum liquidity of 4000 million at december 31 2014  our consolidated leverage ratio was 2711  and our interest coverage ratio was 8311  both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence the obligations under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed subject to certain exceptions by substantially all of the material domestic subsidiaries of the company and subject to certain exceptions and limitations secured by a pledge on substantially all of the equity interests owned by the company and each guarantor 

  

at december 31 2014  we had 2000 million  in borrowings outstanding and approximately 60 million  in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 8500 million revolving credit facility this facility is used principally for working capital needs and at certain times to help fund acquisitions the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in our senior credit agreement moreover additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur notwithstanding these restrictions we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december 31 2014  we would have been permitted 5331 million  of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31 2014  moreover additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 

  

as of december 31 2014 the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 2019 notes and 2024 notes was 5000 million the indentures governing the 2019 notes and 2024 notes contain negative covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions and pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock subject to specified conditions the obligations under the 2019 notes and 2024 notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our existing and future 100 owned domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor or other obligor under our senior credit agreement and by certain of our other 100 owned domestic subsidiaries 

as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior credit agreement and our 2019 notes and 2024 notes 

  

in addition we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 500 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2014  the maximum amount available for borrowing under this facility was 453 million  this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had 47 million  of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

our convertible notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method we must calculate the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the convertible notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period at the time we issued the convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes by in effect increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes from our economic standpoint to 7465 however under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap” since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is antidilutive we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 

under the treasury stock method changes in the price per share of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation the following table illustrates how changes in our stock price would affect i the number of shares issuable issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes ii the number of additional shares deemed outstanding with respect to the convertible notes after applying the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share total treasury stock method incremental shares and iii the number of shares issuable upon concurrent settlement of the convertible notes the warrant and the convertible note hedge incremental shares issued by teleflex upon conversion 



  

 

our convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including in any fiscal quarter following an immediately preceding fiscal quarter in which the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter exceeds 130 of the conversion price of the convertible notes approximately 7972 since the fourth quarter of 2013 and in all subsequent periods through december 31 2014 the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeded the 130 threshold described above and accordingly the convertible notes are classified as a current liability as of december 31 2014  and 2013 the determination of whether or not the convertible notes are convertible under such circumstances is made each quarter until their maturity conversion or repurchase consequently the convertible notes may not be convertible in one or more future quarters if the common stock pricebased conversion contingency is not satisfied in such quarters in which case the convertible notes would again be classified as longterm debt unless another conversion contingency set forth in the convertible notes has been satisfied we have elected a net settlement method to satisfy our conversion obligation under which we will settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facility our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity the classification of the convertible notes as a current liability had no impact on our financial covenants 

  

for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

stock repurchase programs 

in 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million  of outstanding our common stock repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generation from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition under our senior credit agreements we are subject to certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase shares in the event our consolidated leverage ratio generally the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement exceeds certain levels which may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization through december 31 2014  no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 

contractual obligations   

contractual obligations at december 31 2014  are as follows 

  



  

 

we recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 509 million  and 552 million  as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 

  

in 2014  cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were 95 million  and we estimate the amount of required cash contributions in 2015  will be approximately 29 million  due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2015  and as a result these contributions have been excluded from contractual obligations shown above 

  

see notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

  

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable considering the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 

in light of the volatility in global economic markets during the past several years we instituted enhanced measures to facilitate customerbycustomer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts such measures included monthly credit control committee meetings at which customer credit risks are identified after review of among other things accounts that exceed specified credit limits payment delinquencies and other customer issues in addition with respect to certain of our nongovernment customers we instituted measures designed to reduce our risk exposures including issuing dunning letters reducing credit limits requiring that payments accompany orders and instituting legal action with respect to delinquent accounts with respect to government customers we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with any limitations on the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices 

some of our customers particularly in europe have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided resulting in potential collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers for the most part in greece italy spain and portugal at december 31 2014  these countries accounted for 273  of our total net current and longterm accounts receivable net longterm receivables of 113 million  and 176 million  are included in other assets on the balance sheet at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate to the extent that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain additional allowances may be required in future periods our allowance for doubtful accounts was 88 million  and 107 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively which was 29  and 33  of gross accounts receivable at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

  

we offer rebates to certain distributors and reserve an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim distributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience and record the adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 104 million  and 78 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we expect the reserve as of december 31 2014  to be paid within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

  

inventory utilization 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 

our inventory reserve was 339 million  and 324 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively which equaled 92 and 89 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

accounting for longlived assets 

  

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involves significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

  

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets include indefinitelived assets such as goodwill and certain trade names or brands as well as finitelived intangibles such as trade names or brands that do not have indefinite lives customer relationships patents and other technologies the costs of finitelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets primarily certain trade names and trademarks are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the impairment analysis including evaluating the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and estimating future cash flows which are key elements in determining fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

goodwill 

  

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment we have a total of ten reporting units eight of whose assets include goodwill in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test described below alternatively we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the twostep impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis in the fourth quarter 2014 we performed a qualitative assessment on five of our reporting units whose assets include goodwill and determined based on our assessment that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not higher than its carrying value and therefore that their goodwill is not impaired for the three remaining reporting units whose assets include goodwill we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and test each of those reporting units through the twostep quantitative impairment test 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its carrying value in performing the first step we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows dcf of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which we determine in the second step of the twostep test the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2014  as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter of 2014  impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit the discount rate was 100 for all reporting units a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units 

we determined that no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units had occurred based on our assessment of their respective fair values in the fourth quarter 2014 using the methodology described above 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle under the income approach changes in assumptions could cause a reporting units carrying value to exceed its fair value for example an increase of over 20 in the discount rate or a decrease of over 25 percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would indicate impairment for the reporting units while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value may decline if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges 

other intangible assets 

  

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology customer relationships and trade names management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing the qualitative assessment we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amounts alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test in the fourth quarter 2014 we performed a qualitative assessment on all of our indefinite lived assets except for two trade names and determined based on the assessment that their fair values were more likely than not higher than their carrying values for the remaining two trade names we elected to test impairment through the quantitative method 

in connection with the quantitative impairment test since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value the fair value of trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and terminal growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the trade names during the fourth quarter of 2014  are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from the trade names ranged from 2  to 5  and a royalty rate of 4  was assumed discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated from the respective intangible assets assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trade names are being licensed in the marketplace 

we determined that no impairment in the carrying value of our indefinitelived intangible assets had occurred based on our assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above 

we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for finitelived intangible assets eg customer relationships for further details on the assessment of recoverability of finitelived intangible assets see accounting for longlived assets 

in may 2012 we acquired semprus biosciences a biomedical research and development company that developed a polymer surface treatment technology intended to reduce thrombus related complications as previously disclosed we experienced difficulties with respect to the development of the semprus technology and were devoting further research and testing towards attempting to resolve the issue as a result of these efforts we believe we have resolved the issue and are focused on seeking regulatory approval and engaging in additional research and development efforts to achieve commercialization of this technology despite this progress significant challenges to commercialization of the semprus technology remain and we ultimately may find it necessary to recognize future impairment charges with respect to the related assets which could be material as of december 31 2014  we have recorded iprd intangible assets of approximately 410 million  related to semprus 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

  



for additional information on assumptions pertaining to pension and other postretirement benefit plans refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

sharebased compensation 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option share based compensation expense for 2014  2013  and 2012  was 122 million  119 million  and 86 million  respectively 

      accounting for contingent consideration liabilities 

  

in connection with an acquisition we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives such as receipt of regulatory approval commercialization of a product achievement of sales targets or the passage of time as of the acquisition date we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay the fair value of the contingent consideration is calculated based on a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow analysis we remeasure this liability each reporting period and record the change in the liabilitys fair value in our consolidated statement of income loss an increase or decrease in the fair value can result from changes in the discount rate timing estimated probability of achievement of the specified objectives and revenue estimates among other factors as of december 31 2014  the range of undiscounted amounts the company could be required to pay under contingent consideration arrangements is between 150 million  and 830 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we accrued 334 million  and 203 million  of contingent consideration respectively for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 and 2013  we recorded reductions to contingent consideration of 82 million and 123 million  respectively these reductions were the result of changes in estimated probabilities associated with certain regulatory sales milestones 

accounting for income taxes 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final united states and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 991 million  and 865 million  at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that necessitate an adjustment become known specifically we are currently in the midst of examinations by the austrian canadian german and the united states taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results

teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we market and sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers in more than 150 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure we manufacture our products at 27 manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the united states 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 











our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to consistently bring cost effective innovative products to market that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing new innovative products for existing and new therapeutic applications as well as enhancements to and line extensions of existing products we introduced 27 new products and line extensions during 2013 our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i and class ii devices which require 510k clearance by the united states food and drug administration or fda for sale in the united states we believe that 510k clearance reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii devices 

we also continue to broaden our product portfolio with select acquisitions during 2013 we acquired 







similarly in 2012 we broadened our product portfolio through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma international nv lma a global provider of laryngeal masks whose products are used in anesthesia and emergency care this acquisition enhanced our anesthesia product portfolio in addition consistent with our strategy to invest in new technologies and research and development to support our future growth we completed four latestage technology acquisit ions during 2012

critical care 

we are a leading provider of specialty products for critical care which is predominantly comprised of singleuse products our critical care products are used in a wide range of procedures for vascular access anesthesia and airway management respiratory therapy treatment of urologic conditions and other specialty procedures the large majority of our critical care products are sold to the hospitals and healthcare providers with a smaller percentage sold to alternate sites such as home care emergency medical services ems long term care centers primary care centers hospice and animal health facilities our c ritical care product group is our largest product group representing 70 percent of net revenues in 2013  

vascular access 

our vascular access products which accounted for 33 percent of our critical care net revenues in 2013 facilitate a variety of critical care therapies including the administration of intravenous medications and other therapies and the measurement of blood pressure and taking of blood samples through a single puncture site 

our vascular access catheters and related devices consist principally of t he following 













 



the large majority of our cvcs are treated with the arrowgard or arrowgard blue plus antimicrobial surface treatments to reduce the risk of catheter related bloodstream infection arrowgard blue plus provides antimicrobial treatment of the interior lumens and hubs of each catheter the chloragard technology an option on our picc catheters provides both antimicrobial and anti thrombogenic protection for up to 30 days these surface treatments help reduce healthcare acquired conditions such as catheter related blood stream infection crbsi potentially saving the hospitals significant cost under the new pay for performance standards 

we also offer many of our vascular access catheters in a maximal barrier precautions tray the tray is available for cvcs piccs and multi access catheters mac and includes a full body drape coated or noncoated catheter and other accessories these kits are designed to assist healthcare providers in complying with guidelines for reducing catheterrelated bloodstream infections that have been established by a variety of health regulatory agencies such as the centers for disease control and prevention and the joint commission on the accreditation of healthcare organizations our newer ergopack system provides components which are packaged in the tray in the order in which they will be needed during the procedure and incorporates features intended to enhance ease of use and patient and provider safety 

we believe that our vascular product portfolio offer s the opportunity to reduce injuries to the healthcare provider expedite placement of a central venous catheter reduce patient exposure to xrays expedite infusion of medication and reduce the risk of catheter related infection and thrombosis for the patient moreover we believe our products can help hospitals achieve reduced costs improved quality and patient outcomes and increased patient satisfaction 

anesthesia 

our anesthesia products described below include airway and pain management products and accounted for 31 percent of our critical care product net revenues in 2013 

airway management 

our airway management products marketed under the lma ® and rusch ® brands are designed to help eliminate airway related complications and improve procedural efficiencies for patients in surgical critical care and emergency settings 

the lma laryngeal mask products are used in anesthesia and emergency care the rusch brand of products includes reusable and disposable laryngoscope blades and handles endotracheal tubes endobronchial tubes oral and nasal airways endobronchial blockers and other accessories 

as a result of our acquisition of the ultimate medical business in 2013 we now offer ultimate medicals broad range of laryngeal mask airways including the cuff pilot™ an integrated cuff pressure indicator for singleuse airway management devices the cuff pilot is a singleuse device that provides constant insidethecuff pressure indication enabling ataglance clinical assessments the cuff pilot technology is currently used with our ultimate medical portfolio of laryngeal masks and has potential application for use with lma tm laryngeal masks and rusch endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes 

in 2013 we introduced the rusch trulite™ laryngoscope system a disposable laryngoscope blade and handle system for single patient use rusch single use laryngoscope eliminates the potential risk of patient crosscontamination and the cost of maintaining reusable laryngoscopes 

in 2012 we acquired the ezblocker endobronchial blocker which is designed to provide an improved alternative to double lumen endobronchial tubes and single balloon bronchial blockers to achieve lung isolation the ezblocker endobronchial blockers yshaped distal end enables effective placement of the balloons in the right or left bronchus when performing thoracic surgical procedures while also enabling secure placement at the carina this placement minimizes the need to manipulate the catheter after placement reducing the potential of cuffs becoming dislodged 

 

pain management 

our portfolio of pain management products are marketed under the arrow brand and are designed to provide pain relief during a broad range of surgical and obstetric procedures thereby helping clinicians better manage each patient’s individual pain while reducing complications and associated costs our pain management products include epidural catheters and trays spinal needles and trays and peripheral nerve block needles catheters trays and ambulatory pain pumps 

in 2013 we expanded our pain management portfolio by adding the arrow autofuser ® disposable pain pump the autofuser pump is designed to provide an accurate and flexible method to deliver analgesic medication for continuous peripheral nerve block or sitespecific applications helping physicians to take control of patients postoperative pain to promote faster recovery and reduce overall length of stay autofuser pain pumps are available in three different sizes with a selection of fixed or variable basal infusion rates allowing physicians to customize their patients pain protocol the parallel bolus feature enables patients to administer a controlled amount of additional anesthetic to the target site without interrupting the continuous infusion of medication providing an effective method to manage pain which is a common postoperative challenge 

this autofuser pain pump can be used in conjunction with the recently introduced arrow flexblock™ continuous peripheral nerve block catheter the flexblock catheter features an echogenic coilreinforced design that offers a combination of ultrasound visibility flexibility and excellent kink resistance 

we offer a variety of single shot nerve block needles including the arrow ultraquik™ stimuquik® and stimuquik echo providing solutions to clinicians performing peripheral nerve blocks whether they use ultrasound only nerve stimulation only or a combined approach we commenced sales of arrow ultraquik peripheral nerve block needles in 2013 these echogenic needles are designed to help increase ov erall block success for clinicians who use ultrasoundguidance when performing singleinjection peripheral nerve blocks ultraquik needles maintain many of the same features as the arrow stimuquik echo needles including five grooved rings at the distal tip of the needle to help clinicians identify the needle tip under ultrasound 

respiratory care 

our respiratory care products accounted for 15 percent of our critical care product net revenues in 2013 our hudson rci brand has been a leader in respiratory care for more than 65 years providing innovative products designed to help clinicians improve patient outcomes while reducing costs our respiratory products are used in a variety of care settings and include oxygen therapy products including oxygen masks cannulas humidifiers and tubing aerosol therapy products including small and large volume nebulizers peak flow meters and aerosol chambers spirometry products including incentive breathing exercisers and ventilation management products including ventilator circuits humidification devices and bacteriavirus filters 

in 2013 for the second c onsecutive year we were among the six companies to receive the zenith award awarded by the american association for respiratory care aarc in recognition of the quality products programs and support provided to the respiratory community 

in 2013 we received fda 510k clearance for our isogard ® mask with clearair ™ technology  a new product that helps to reduce clinician exposure to hazardous waste anesthetic gases wag which are commonly used in surgical procedures globally when patients are recovering in the post anesthesia care unit pacu of a hospital they typically exhale these gases into the nurses’ breathing zone and work environment the occupational safety and health administration osha has noted of several potential adverse health effects from wag exposure including nausea dizziness headaches and fatigue 

the isogard mask is designed to reduce wag within a nurse’s breathing zone to minimize the cumulative effect of lowlevel exposure to these hazardous gases in the pacu the multipurpose mask collects and removes or scavenges wag while simultaneously delivering oxygen to the patient the patentpending clearair technology creates a unidirectional flow of oxygen through the nasaloral area of the patient for inhalation while negative pressure or suction is applied to the port in the lower portion of the mask to scavenge the patient’s exhalation by providing a means to reduce the amount of wag within the breathing zone of the caregiver hospitals can better comply with osha and the national institute for occupational safety and health’s recommendations for workplace safety 

 

specialty 

our specialty products accounted for 21 percent of our critical care product net revenues in 2013 specialty products include interventional access products as well as products provided to specialty market customers interventional access products focus on dialysis oncology and critical care at hospitals products sold to specialty market customers including home care prehospital and other alternative channels of care focus on urology respiratory and anesthesia products 

our specialty product line of urology products provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and individuals in the home care markets the product portfolio consists principally of a wide range of catheters including foley intermittent external and suprapubic urine collectors catheterization accessories and products for operative endourology marketed under the rusch brand name 

the gibeck® trachvent® hme family of products are designed to provide humidification for spontaneously breathing tracheostomized patients in november 2012 we introduced the gibeck trach vent t with 5mm collar this hme heat and moisture exchanger provides optimal moisture via gibeck microwell paper while accommodating all patient sizes 

over the past few years we have continued to expand our specialty product offerings to include a wider range of intermittent catheters catheter insertion kits and accessories used mainly for people with spinal cord injury spina bifida and multiple sclerosis many of these products are designed to support user safety and infection prevention efforts for example an intermittent catheter with hydrophilic coating an ergothan tip protective sleeve and sterile saline solution is marketed in our emea region in the united states we recently expanded our hydrophilic coated intermittent catheter line to include female lengths coudés for difficult catheterizations as well as complete sterile insertion kits for both standard male and female lengths the uncoated intermittent catheter line in the united states was also expanded recently to include a full range of female length catheters and a complete offering of sterile insertion kits for the standard male coudé and female styles 

sales of our specialty intermittent catheters in the united states have benefited from a change in reimbursement policy home care markets are subject to local and regional reimbursement regulations that can impact volumes and pricing in the united states reimbursement regulations were implemented in 2008 that permit reimbursement for up to 200 catheters per month replacing the previous limit of four catheters per month the change promoted a shift from reuseable catheters with their inherent risk of infections to singleuse intermittent catheters 

our interventional access products are used in a wide range of applications including dialysis oncology and critical care dialysis products include the arrow branded long term hemodialysis catheters antimicrobial acute hemodialysis catheters and the arrowtrerotola™ percutaneous thrombectomy device our long term hemodialysis catheter portfolio offers both antegrade and retrograde insertion options for both split and step tip configurations the most recent addition of the nextstep® retrograde femoral length catheter completed the product portfolio in june 2013 after fda 510k clearance the arrow acute hemodialysis catheters are available with arrowgard antimicrobial technology which reduces the risk catheter related bacteremia 

in addition our recent acquisition of vidacare expanded our specialty products portfolio by adding the vidacare ezio intraosseous vascular access oncontrol® bone marrow and oncontrol bone access systems to the products we offer to our interventional access and specialty markets customers as previously described the vidacare ezio intraosseous vascular access system provides immediate vascular access via the intraosseous route enabling emergency care providers to quickly administer critical medications and fluids particularly when traditional vascular access is difficult or impossible vidacare’s oncontrol bone marrow system enables rapid and safe access for hematology and oncology diagnostic practices the vidacare oncontrol bone access system provides rapid and safe access for surgical bone applications such as vertebroplasty and the biopsy of the vertebral body and bone lesions 

the arrow polysite® low profile hybrid port received fda 510k clearance in december 2013 available with or without pressure injection capability the hybrid design combines a lightweight plastic body for patient comfort and a strong titanium reservoir for durability 

interventional access products also include several arrow branded products for critical care applications including diagnostic and drainage kits embolectomy balloons and reinforced percutaneous sheath introducers 

 

surgical care 

our surgical care products sales represented 18 percent of our net revenues in 2013 our surgical products which are predominantly comprised of singleuse products include ligation and closure products including appliers clips and sutures used in a variety of surgical procedures access ports used in minimally invasive surgical procedures  including robotic surgery and fluid management products used for chest drainage our surgical products also include reusable handheld instruments for general and specialty surgical procedures we market our surgical products under the deknatel pilling pleurevac taut and weck brand names 

in 2013 we added a microlaparoscopic product line to the surgical portfolio designed to enhance surgeons’ ability to perform scarless surgery while producing better patient outcomes microlaparoscopy unlike notes natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery or single incision surgery provides surgeons a mechanism for performing minimally invasive procedures without significant changes in technique the technology may be utilized for an entire procedure or as an adjunct to existing approaches that require additional access without adding to larger incisions and the associated risks this product line is expected to generate revenues in late 2014 

in 2012 we launched the weck efx tm endo fascial closure system a port site closure device used in laparoscopic surgical procedures the weck efx system encompasses a design for port site closure that enables reproducible fascial closure in varying body types with a controlled suture delivery this approach to port site closure is designed to minimize complications and costs associated with portsite herniation 

hemolok a significant part of the weck portfolio is a unique locking polymer ligation clip that combines the security of a suture with the speed of a metal clip for open and laparoscopic surgery  hemolok clips have special applications in robotic laparoscopic and cardiovascular surgery 

cardiac care 

cardiac care products accounted for approximately 4 percent of net revenues in 2013 products in this category include diagnostic catheters and capital equipment our diagnostic catheters include thermodilution and wedge pressure catheters specialized angiographic catheters such as berman and reverse berman catheters therapeutic delivery catheters such as temporary pacing catheters sheaths for femoral and transradial aortic access used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and intraaortic balloon or iab catheters capital equipment includes our intraaortic balloon pump or iabp consoles iabp products are used to augment oxygen delivery to the cardiac muscle and reduce the oxygen demand after cardiac surgery serious heart attack or interventional procedures we market our cardiac care products under the arrow brand name 

the iab and iabp product lines feature the autocat 2 wave console and the fiberoptix catheter which together utilize fiber optic technology for arterial pressure signal acquisition and enable the patented wave timing algorithm to support the broadest range of patient heart rhyth ms including severely arrhythmic patients 

oem and development services 

product development and production services marketed to original equipment manufacturers or oems represented 8 percent of our net revenues in 2013 our oem division which includes the tfx oem ® and deknatel ® oem nameplates provides customengineered extrusions diagnostic and interventional catheters sheathdilator sets introducers and kits sutures performance fibers and bioresorbable resins and fibers we offer an extensive portfolio of integrated capabilities including engineering material selection regulatory affairs prototyping testing and validation manufacturing assembly and packing 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we have grown and evolved through entries into new businesses development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and through acquisitions of companies throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

over the past several years we have significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets the most significant of these transactions occurred in 2007 with our acquisition of arrow 

 

international a leading global supplier of catheterbased medical technology products used for vascular access and cardiac care and the divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses our acquisition of arrow significantly expanded our singleuse product offerings for critical care enhanced our global footprint and added to our research and development capabilities with the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we became exclusively a medical device company 

we expect to continue to increase the size of our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth initiatives from time to time we explore and engage in discussions regarding acquisitions that would augment our existing medical device platform 

government regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the united states relating to the development manufacture sale and distribution of our products 

regulation of medical devices in the united states 

all of our medical devices manufactured or sold in the united states are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” as implemented and enforced by the fda the fda and in some cases other government agencies administer requirements for the design testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling storage record keeping clearance approval advertising and promotion distribution postmarket surveillance import and export of our medical devices 

unless an exemption applies each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance by submitting a premarket notification “510k” or approval by filing a premarket approval application “pma” from the fda pursuant to the fdc act to obtain 510k clearance a manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device referred to as the predicate dev ice substantial equivalence is established by the applicant showing that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device the fda’s 510k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months but it can last longer a device that is not eligible for the 510k process because there is no predicate device may be reviewed through the de novo process a device not eligible for 510k clearance must follow the pma approval pathway which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda’s satisfaction the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly lengthy and uncertain than the 510k process it generally takes from one to three years or even longer our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i and class ii devices that require 510k clearance in addition modifications made to devices after they receive clearance or approval may require a new 510k clearance or approval of a pma or pma supplement we cannot be sure that 510k clearance or pma approval will be obtained for any device that we propose to market 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k the sponsor of a clinical study must comply with and conduct the study in accordance with the applicable federal regulations including fda’s investigational device exemption “ide” requirements and good clinical practice “gcp” clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board or irb  which is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve require modifications in or disapprove research to protect the rights safety and welfare of the human research subject the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients an irb may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted for failure to comply with the irb’s requirements or may impose other conditions 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply those regulatory requirements include the following 









 











in september 2013 the fda issued final regulations and draft guidance documents regarding the unique device identification “udi” system which will require manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers while the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety it will require us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling which could increase our costs the udi system is being implemented in stages based on device risk with the first requirements taking effect in september 2014 and the last taking effect in september 2020 

our manufacturing facilities as well as those of certain of our suppliers are subject to periodic and forcause inspections to verify compliance with the qsr as well as other regulatory requirements 

if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from issuance of a warning or untitled letter to more severe sanctions such as product recalls or seizures civil penalties consent decrees injunctions criminal prosecution operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production refusal to permit importation or exportation refusal to grant or delays in granting clearances or approvals or withdrawal or suspension of existing clearances or approvals the fda also has the authority to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 

regulation of medical devices outside of the united states 

medical device laws also are in effect in many of the markets outside of the united states in which we do business these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications inspection of and controls over manufacturing as well as monitoring of devicerelated adverse events are components of most of these regulatory systems 

healthcare laws 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the united states targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry these laws prohibit us from among other things soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration to induce the referral or use of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federally or state financed healthcare programs violations of these laws are punishable by imprisonment criminal fines civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition we are subject to federal and state false claims laws in the united states that prohibit the submission of false payment claims under medicare medicaid or other federally or state funded programs certain marketing practices such as offlabel promotion and violations of federal antikickback laws may also constitute violations of these laws 

we are also subject to various federal and state reporting and disclosure requirements related to the healthcare industry recent rules issued by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms require us to collect and beginning in march 2014 report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members the reported da ta will be posted in searchable form on a public website beginning september 30 2014 failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties in addition several states now require medical device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of device products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states other states prohibit various other marketingrelated activities the federal government and still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

 

other regulatory requirements 

we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar antibribery laws applicable in jurisdictions outside the united state that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to nonunited states government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of governmentsponsored healthcare systems around the world most of our customer relationships outside of the united state s are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in the sale delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the united states we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations including those administered by the department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security “bis” which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries andor with certain individuals identified by the united states government despite our global trade and compliance program our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and imprisonment 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness our major competitors include c r bard inc covidien and carefusion 

sales and marketing 

our product sales are made directly to hospitals healthcare providers  distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces and through independent representatives and through independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers  therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularl y steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass these cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and our efforts to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures our research and development expenditures were 650 million  563 million and 487 million for the yearsended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011  respectively 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products historically we have experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of these factors 

employees 

we employed approximately 11400 fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2013 of these employees approximately 3000 were employed in the united states and 8400 in countries other than the united states approximately 5 percent of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collectivebargaining arrangements we believe we have good relationships with our employees 

environmental 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the united states our operations like those of other medical device companies involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes while we continue to make capital and operational expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection health and safety laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows further we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

investor information 

we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” therefore we file reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec copies of such reports proxy statements and other information may be obtained by visiting the public reference room of the sec at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 or by calling the sec at 1800sec0330 in addition the sec maintains a website httpwwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks include but are not limited to the following 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and mar keting resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as our inability to 







 



in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that provide better features clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do busi ness even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the extent of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by reducing potential customers’ selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay 

in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our existing products and potential new products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including the realignment of our north american organizational structure facility consolidations and reductions in our workforce while we have realized some efficiencies from these actions we may not realize the benefits of these initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such benefi ts may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we began in 2012 and are continuing to transition our businesses to a single enterprise resource planning or erp system in the third quarter of 2013 we completed the initial phase of this transition without experiencing any significant disruptions to our business or operations however in the event we encounter any problems with future phases of this transition we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of the erp system could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern the development design approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover 

 

these regulations are subject to future change failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business which could include 

























 

we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business fina ncial condition and results of operations 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k clearance or approval of a premarket approval or pma application from the fda in order for us to obtain 510k clearance the fda must determine that our proposed product is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device  to establish substantial equivalence the applicant must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device and it either has the same technological characteristics or it has been shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device obtaining pma approval is more difficult requiring us to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based in part on data obtained in human clinical trials similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign governmental authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application violations of fda requirements for medical devices could result in fda enforceme nt actions including 















 



medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses promoting a device for an offlabel use could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation which requires periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above moreover issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims that may be brought against us and recalls which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore as a medical device company we face an inherent risk of d amage to our reputation if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the cost to defend against these lawsuits may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by regulatory authorities to participate in a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may experience lost sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could reduce market acceptance of our products harm our reputation decrease demand for our products result in the loss of customers lead to product withdrawals or harm our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the futureproduct liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions including the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets in recent years the credit and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years leading to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending these recessionary conditions have cause d customers to reduce delay or cancel purchases of our products and services while recent economic indicators suggest improvement in the united states and global economy we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more normalized spending behaviors if the recessionary conditions worsen our customers may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us 

adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause them to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us such as shortening the required payment period for our accounts payable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us these types of actions could significantly affect our liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally our customers particularly in the european region have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided which may lead to collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our c ustomers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our foreseeable additional operating needs however in light of the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets there is a risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity as of december 31 2013 and 2012 our aggregate net receivables in italy spain portugal and greece were 979 million and 1010 million 

 

respectively in 2013 2012 and 2011 net revenues from these countries were approximately 8 9 and 9 of total net revenues respectively and average days that accounts receivable were outstanding were 260 288 and 318 days respectively although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our operating results moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income 

our strategic initiatives include making significant investments that are designed to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns even if we are successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than we originally anticipated we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisitionrelated charges amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges and other issues that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business including issues related to internal control over financial reporting regulatory or compliance issues and potential adverse shortterm effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all the manufacture of our products is also highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements problems in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures defective raw materials and environmental factors could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including 













our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 









if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our busines s and our financial results the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “healthcare reform act” imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers our first report is due march 30 2014 and the reported information will be made publicly available in a searchable format beginning september 30 2014 in addition device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california connecticut n evada and massachusetts mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance andor reporting requirements among a 

 

number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare reform act substantially changes the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services  and significantly impacts the united states pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the healthcare reform act 









in 2013 we paid 115 million with respect to the medical device excise tax however we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the healthcare reform act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we are subject to risks associated with our non united states operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the united states including canada belgium the czech republic france germany ireland malaysia mexico and singapore as of december 31 2013 approximately 37 of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states and 74 of our fulltime and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states in addition in 2013 approximately 50 of our net revenues based on teleflex location were derived from operations outside the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states including 

























in addition the united states foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonunited states jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonunited states officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded united states corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments 

 

and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents and may be exposed to liability due to preacquisition conduct of employees or agents of businesses or operations we may acquire violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also could be subject to severe penalties including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in united states government contracts 

the risks relating to our foreign operations may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenues from products manufactured in and sold into nonunited states markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonunited states currencies to united states dollars our reporting currency when the united states dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our united states dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currency in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers and thus adversely affect their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect our results 

as a company with significant operations outside of the united states we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

in addition unfavorable results of tax audits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

research and development for some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development and use of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and pu blic speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous united states and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states there is no guarantee that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information or copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be required to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages and to cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may lead us to incur significant costs and have an adverse effect on our business 

we also are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significa nt expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2013 we had total consolidated indebtedness of  1286 million 

 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 













if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 









we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

our revolving credit agreement and the indenture governing our 6875 senior subordinated notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to 



















 

in addition our revolving credit agreement also contains financial covenants a breach of any covenants under any one or more of these debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debts in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

the contingent conversion features of our convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2010 we issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 which we refer to as the “convertible notes” the convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including the attainment of a closing price per share of our common stock equal to 130 of the conversion price approximately 7972 for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter because our closing stock price during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on december 31 2013 exceeded 130 of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days the convertible notes are currently convertible into shares of our common stock as a result the convertible notes are classified as a current liability which in turn has resulted in a material reduction of our net working capital at this time we have elected the net settlement method to satisfy the conversion obligation under which we may settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares while we believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand and accessing our credit facility as well as raising money in the capital markets if necessary our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the convertible notes 

the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with third parties which we refer to as the hedge counterparties the hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the convertible notes and are expected to reduce our exposure to potential dilution wi th respect to our common stock andor reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that may be required to be made by us upon conversion of the convertible notes separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock with the hedge counterparties with a strike price of 74648 subject to customary antidilution adjustments pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue shares of our common stock the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or if we so elect obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants in addition under applicable accounting guidance changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation with respect to the convertible notes and warrants which in turn could impact our reported financial results based on the average market price of our common stock during 2013 06 million shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants were included in the total diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2013 for additional information see “financing arrangements” under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10k 

in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates entered into various cashsettled overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the convertible notes the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates may in their sole discretion with or without notice modify their hedge positions from time to time and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to the conversion of the convertible notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution and we will be subject to the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to 

 

the credit risk of each hedge counterparty will not be secured by any collateral if a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock market price and in volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by a hedge counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes which could lower the price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2013 we had outstanding approximately 412 million shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 13 million shares of our common stock of which approximately 07 million were vested as of that date approximately 04 million of restricted stock awards which are expected to vest over the next three years and approximately 20000 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan in addition as of december 31 2013 171 million shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options upon conversion of the convertible notes and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options and warrants and the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock issuable upon any exercise of stock options or warrants or conversion of the convertible notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the issuance and sale including through exercise of stock options and warrants of substantial amounts of common stock or conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships 

we rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations we also rely on our technology infrastructure among other functions to interact with customers and suppliers fulfill orders and bill collect and make payments ship products provide support to customers fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business our internal information technology systems as well as those systems maintained by thirdparty providers may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks any of which if successful could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation and financial results if we fail to monitor maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems we could among other things lose existing customers have difficulty preventing fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other health care professionals be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties incur expenses or lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business 

the sec has promulgated final rules pursuant to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act regarding disclosure of the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold known as conflict minerals included in components of products either manufact ured by public companies or for which public companies have contracted to manufacture these new rules require due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the “drc” or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the drc the first conflict minerals report required by the new rules is due by may 31 2014 and annually thereafter at this time we have determined that certain of our products contain the specified minerals and we have developed a process to enable us to identify where such minerals originated we expect to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products in 

 

addition the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products our customers may require our products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues and margins may be harmed if we are unable to provide assurances to our customers that our products are “drc conflict free” generally the product does not contain conflict minerals originating in the drc or an adjoining country that directly or indirectly finance or benefit specified armed groups or to procure conflict free minerals at a reasonable price or at all or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting these demands we also may face reputational challenges if the due diligence procedures we implement do not enable us to verify the origins of all conflict minerals or to determine that any conflict minerals used in products we manufacture or in products manufactured by others for us are drc conflictfree 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 







these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time in 2013 our cost s related to compliance with or liabilities under these laws totaled 09 million we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 5 percent of our employees in the united states and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collectivebargaining arrangements  in addition for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 approximately 1 of our net revenues were generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings compliance with debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our convertible notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conver sion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

 

certain provisions in the convertible notes and the indenture governing the convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if an acquisition event constitutes a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in addition if an acquisition event constitutes a “makewhole fundamental change” as defined in the indenture we may b e required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such acquisition event in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock

overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers in more than 150 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure 

we categorize our products into four groups critical care surgical care cardiac care and original equipment manufacturer and development services “oem” critical care representing our largest product group includes medical devices used in vascular access anesthesia respiratory care and specialty markets surgical care includes surgical instruments and devices and cardiac care includes cardiac assist devices and equipment oem designs and manufactures instruments and devices for other medical device manufacturers 

effective january 1 2014 we realigned our operating segments the vascular anesthesiarespiratory and surgical businesses which previously comprised much of the americas operating segment are now separate operating segments additionally the company made changes to the allocation methodology of certain costs including manufacturing variances and research and development costs among the businesses to improve accountability because the change in segment reporting structure became effective in the first quarter of 2014 the segment information presented in this document does not reflect this change 

through an extensive acquisition and divestiture program we have significantly expanded our presence in the medical technology industry while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace automotive industrial and marine markets the following is a listing of our more significant acquisitions and divestitures that have occurred since the beginning of 2011 with respect to divested businesses listed below we have reported results of operations cash flows and gains losses on the disposition of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our significant divestitures 

medical device business transactions 

 



 

we may be required to pay contingent consideration in connection with some of the acquisitions listed above the amount of contingent consideration we ultimately will pay will be based upon the achievement of specified objectives including regulatory approvals and sales targets for additional information on the contingent consideration see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

former aerospace segment divestiture 

in december 2011 we sold the cargo systems and container businesses for approximately 280 mill ion and realized a gain of 1268 million net of tax 

former commercial segment divestiture 

in march 2011 we sold the marine businesses that were engaged in the design manufacture and distribution of steering and throttle controls and engine and drive assemblies for the recreational marine market heaters for commercial vehicles and burner units for military field feeding appliances for 1231 million consisting of 1016 million in cash net of 15 million of cash included in the marine business as part of the net assets sold plus a subordinated promissory note in the amount of 45 million which has subsequently been repaid in full and the assumption by the buyer of approximately 155 million in liabilities related to the marine business we realized a gain of 573 million net of tax benefits in connection with the sale 

looking ahead our strategy is to continue to be opportunistic and focus our attention on adding a combination of technology and strategic acquisitions to further strengthe n our existing product portfolio within the medical technology industry additionally we will continue to identify opportunities to expand our margins by evaluating our existing product portfolio and shedding product lines that do not meet our financial criteria as well as optimizing our overall facility footprint to further reduce our cost base 

health care reform 

on march 23 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law t his legislation will have a significant impact on our business for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare which could negatively affect pricing of our products in addition commencing in 2013 the legislation imposes a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices for the year ended december 31 2013 we paid medical device excise taxes of 115 million which is included in selling general and administrative expenses 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions have had adverse impacts on market activities including among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity and reduced demand for products and services i n response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities and we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies in our operations and the consolidation of facilities although on a consolidated basis the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last three years the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit and public sector austerity measures in response to growing public budget deficits could adversely affect our operations and our liquidity 

hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending  distributors in the supply chain generally have reduced inventory levels and have not replenished inventories to prerecession levels the impact of these actions is most pronounced in capital goods markets which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses more recently the economic environment has improved somewhat but has not returned to prerecession levels and challenges persist particularly in some european countries as discussed below approximately 92 percent of our net revenues come from singleuse products primarily used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix change as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers conversely our sales volume could be positively impacted if there are additional insured individuals resulting from the patient protection and affordable care act 

 

in europe some countries have taken austerity measures due to the current economic climate elective surgeries have been delayed and hospital budgets have been reduced in certain countries mainly germany we have seen changes in the local reimbursement to home care patients and pricing impacts on business awarded through the tendering process these markets have introduced more buying groups and group purchasing organizations or gpos resulting in reductions in commodity product pricing it is possible that funding for publically funded healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which has resulted in a slowdown in payments to us we believe this situation will continue and may worsen unless and until these countries are able to find alternative means of funding their respective public healthcare sectors 

in asia recovery from the global recession has varied by country china has announced plans for major healthcare investment targeted at second tier cities and hospitals which may provide future growth opportunities for us while slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan is expected to limit growth in that market

gross profit 

 



comparison of 2013 and 2012 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 130 basis points compared to the corresponding prior year period the increase is principally due to the inclusion of higher margin sales from the lma and vidacare businesses price increases in the americas emea and asia new products in the americas emea and oem manufacturing efficiencies in emea and oem and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates in addition gross profit in the 2012 period was adversely affected by inventory writeoffs for excess slow moving and damaged product in asia these benefits were partly offset by higher warehousing and freight costs in the americas emea and asia lower volumes in the americas and oem and higher product costs in the americas and asia 

comparison of 2012 and 2011 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 70 basis points compared to the corresponding prior year period the increase is primarily due to price increases in all segments and lower manufacturing costs in north america in addition 2011 gross profit reflected charges related to a stock keeping unit “sku” rationalization program we implemented to eliminate skus that provided low sales volume or insufficient margins to help improve future profitability the increases were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates higher manufacturing costs in emea and inventory writeoffs for excess and slow moving product and damaged product in asia 

selling general and administrative 

 



 

comparison of 2013 and 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 4 77 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012 the increase is largely due to expenses associated with the businesses acquired 364 million including 296 million in expenses associated with the lma business the excise tax associated with the patient protection and affordable care act 115 million higher employee related expenses increased costs associated with the conversion of several of our locations to a new enterprise resource planning system 42 million acquisition costs 32 million primarily related to the acquisition of vidacare in the fourth quarter 2013 higher legal costs 58 million due to increases in the legal reserve resulting from new developments during the year related to certain ongoing litigation including a verdict against us with respect to a nonoperating joint venture and professional fees and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 11 million the increases were partly offset by 123 million reversals of contingent consideration related to the acquisitions of hotspur technologies inc hotspur 85 million semprus biosciences corp “semprus” 24 million and the assets of axiom technology partners llp “axiom” 14 million after determining that certain conditions for the payment of certain contingent consideration would not be satisfied selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 also reflected the loss of 76 million from foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into in anticipation of the acquisition of the lma business 

comparison of 201 2 and 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 306 million in 2012 the increase is primarily due to higher general and administrative costs across all segments principall y with respect to higher employee related costs 151 million incremental operating expenses associated with the businesses acquired 147 million a 76 million loss on foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into in anticipation of the acquisition of the lma business acquisition related costs 72 million and higher selling costs 48 million generated by increased revenue and support of new products these increases were partly offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rates 111 million in addition 2011 expenses included increases in the valuation allowance with respect to the greek government bonds that we received in 2011 in settlement of trade receivables due to us from sales to the public hospital system in greece 45 million approximately 22 million of net separation costs for our former ceo comprised of 55 million of payments under his employment agreement less approximately 33 million of stock option and restricted share forfeitures and increases in litigation reserves 17 million 

during the third quarter of 2012 we entered into forward exchange contracts for singapore dollars and us dollars in anticipation of the acquisition of the lma business  in accordance with fasb guidance a forecasted transaction is not eligible for hedge accounting if the forecasted transaction involves a business combination therefo re gains and losses relating to this arrangement were recognized as incurred we realized a pretax loss of 76 million upon settlement of the forward exchange contracts 

research and development 

 



comparison of 2013 and 2012 

the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to the businesses acquired in 2012 

comparison of 2012 and 2011 

the increase in research and development expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 principally reflects continued investment in the new technologies obtained in the second quarter of 2012 through acquisitions and increased investments related to vascular products in north america 

goodwill impairment 

in the first quarter 2012 we changed our north america reporting unit structure from a single reporting unit to five reporting units comprised of vascular anesthesiarespiratory cardiac surgical and specialty we allocated the assets and liabilities of our north america segment among the new reporting units based on their respective operating activities 

 

and then allocated goodwill among the reporting units using a relative fair value approach as required by fasb accounting standards codification “asc” topic 350 

following this allocation we performed goodwill impairment tests on these new reporting units as a result of these tests we determined that three of the reporting units in our north america segment were impaired and in the first quarter of 2012 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 220 million in our vascular reporting unit 107 million in our anesthesiarespiratory reporting unit and 5 million in our cardiac reporting unit in the first quarter of 2012

oem segment operating profit increased 2 82 in 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 the increase reflects the higher net revenues and lower manufacturing costs partly offset by higher general and administrative costs 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liq uidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets 

we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months to date we have not experienced significant payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs however as discussed above in global economic conditions although there have been recent improvements the domestic and global financial markets remain volatile and the global credit markets are constrained which creates risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity consequently we continue to monitor our credit risk particularly related to countries in europe as of december 31 2013 our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in italy spain portugal and greece were 631 million compared to 706 million as of december 31 2012 for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 net revenues from these countries was approximately 8 9 and 9 respectively of total net revenues and average days that current and longterm accounts receivables were outstanding were 260 288 and 318 days respectively as of december 31 2013 and 2012 net current and longterm accounts receivables from these countries were approximately 31 and 34 respectively of consolidated net current and longterm accounts receivables if economic conditions in these countries deteriorate we may experience significant credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries moreover if global economic conditions generally deteriorate we may experience further delays in customer payments reductions in our customers’ purchases and higher credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2014 and beyond see critical accounting estimates for additional information regarding the critical accounting estimates related to our accounts receivable 

 

during 2013 we completed the acquisitions of vidacare corporation and ultimate medical pty ltd whose products complement the product portfolios in our critical care product group and eon surgical ltd whose technology complements the product portfolio in our surgical care product group the aggregate fair value of the consideration paid for these acquisitions was 3070 million we allocated the fair value of the 3070 million consideration paid to assets acquired of 4012 million less liabilities assumed of 942 million the assets acquired included intangibles for intellectual property inprocess research and development customer lists tradenames and goodwill aggregating approximately 3788 million see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions  

during 2013 we also refinanced our senior credit facility replacing our existing 3750 million term loan and our existing 4000 million revolving credit facility with an 8500 million dollar revolving credit facility we used borrowings under the new revolving credit facility to pay down the 375 million principal on the term loan and to fund the related refinancing costs of 64 million the new 850 million senior credit facility bears interest at an applicable rate elected by us equal to either the “base rate” the greater of either the federal funds effective rate plus 05 the prime rate or one month libor plus 10 plus an applicable margin of 025 to 100 or a “libor rate” for the period corresponding to the applicable interest period of the borrowings plus an applicable margin of 125 to 200 as of december 31 2013 the interest rate on the 850 million senior credit facility was 192 comprised of the libor rate of 017 plus a spread of 175 

in 2012 we completed four latestage technology acquisitions and expanded our anesthesia product portfolio through the acquisition of all of the assets of lma international nv the aggregate fair value of the consideration paid was approximately 4222 million which includes initial consideration of approximately 3679 million contingent consideration arrangements related to the businesses acquired which were valued at 558 million and a subsequent 15 million favorable working capital adjustment as of december 31 2013 the maximum aggregate amount of remaining actual contingent consideration that we could be required to pay is 62 million we allocated the fair value of the 4222 million consideration paid to assets acquired of 4705 million net of liabilities assumed of 483 million the assets acquired included intangibles for technology inprocess research and development customer lists tradenames and goodwill aggregating approximately 3805 million 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis of our 4320 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2013 3743 million was held at foreign subsidiaries we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and subject to cash payment of additional united states income taxes or foreign withholding taxes these funds could be repatriated if necessary any additional taxes could be offset at least in part by foreign tax credits the amount of any taxes required to be paid which could be significant and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense as taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested 

in addition to the net cash provided by united statesbased operating activities w e have foreign sources of cash available to help fund our debt service requirements in the united states accordingly we repatriated approximately 67 million and 56 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements these cash distributions are subject to tax in the united states at the corporate tax rate reduced by applicable foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid on distributed earnings approximately 927 million of our 2299 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 was generated in the united states and approximately 461 million of our 1939 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was generated in the united states 

we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until 2018 we anticipate our domestic interest payments for 2014 will be approximately 463 million we plan to utilize cash from operations both from united states as well as foreign based operations and our revolving credit facility to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements 

our convertible notes were reclassified to a current liability because a contingent conversion feature was triggered relating to our stock price refer to the “financing arrangements” section below for additional details 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future see financial arrangements for further information relating to our debt obligations including our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes 

 

cash flows 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 

 



comparison of 2013 and 2012 

 

cash flow from operating activities 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of 2299 million during 2013 compared to 1939 million during 2012 the 360 million increase is primarily due to improved operations yearoveryear partially offset by net unfavorable yearoveryear changes in working capital items primarily inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets inventories increased 89 million during 2013 as compared to a 20 million increase during 2012 the increase was due to sales volume growth primarily in asia prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 59 million during 2013 as compared to a 96 million decrease during 2012 primarily due to the collection of outstanding vat claims in 2012 

 

cash flow from investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 3726 million during 2013 reflecting net payments for businesses acquired of 3090 million and capital expenditures of 636 million the net payments for businesses acquired includes the acquisitions of vidacare eon surgical ltd and ultimate medical pty ltd for an aggregate amount of approximately 3070 million and an asset purchase of 34 million for inprocess research and development related to the eon surgical technology partly offset by a 15 million working capital adjustment with respect to the consideration paid in connection with the lma acquisition 

 

cash flow from financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 2326 million during 2013 on july 16 2013 we refinanced our senior credit facility which was comprised of a 375 million term loan and 4000 million revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new 8500 million senior credit facility consisting solely of a revolving credit facility we used borrowings under the new facility to repay the outstanding 3750 million term loan and to pay costs of 64 million associated with the refinancing during the fourth quarter of 2013 we borrowed an additional 2980 million under the revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of vidacare in addition net cash used in financing activities included dividend payments of 559 million contingent consideration payments of 170 million related to our acquisitions of vasonova inc “vasonova” axiom lma hotspur and the guided imaging business of mepy benelux bvba and payments to noncontrolling interest shareholders of 07 million partly offset by 76 million in proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options issued under our stock compensation plans 

comparison of 2012 and 2011 

 

cash flow from operating activities 

 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately 1939 million during 2012 compared to 944 million during 2011 the 995 million increase is primarily due to favorable yearoveryear changes in working capital items primarily accounts receivable favorable yearoveryear by 406 million inventory favorable yearoveryear by 318 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets favorable yearoveryear by 181 million the yearoveryear improvement in working capital from accounts receivable reflects a significant collection of receivables 

 

from the spanish government approximately 175 million during the second quarter of 2012 largely offset by higher net revenues in 2012 in the americas and emea the comparatively unfavorable change in accounts receivable in 2011 reflected the effect of the termination of a factoring agreement in italy approximately 304 million and a slowdown in collections particularly in italy spain and greece approximately 181 million the yearoveryear improvement in working capital related to inventories reflects a 2012 reduction in the buildup of inventory in 2011 and inventory writeoffs of excess slow moving and damaged product in asia in 2012 the 2011 increase in inventory reflected a planned worldwide buildup of inventory primarily to improve service levels by accelerating fulfillment of customer orders the inventory increases in 2011 also included a 71 million increase in the asia pacific region to stock a new distribution facility in singapore the yearoveryear improvement in working capital from prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily reflects the collection of outstanding 2011 vat claims in 2012 these favorable yearoveryear comparisons were partly offset by a reduction in deferred tax liability associated with potential future repatriation of nonpermanently reinvested foreign earnings in 2012 

 

cash flow from investing activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was  3683 million during 2012 reflecting payments for businesses acquired of 3694 million which includes the aggregate initial consideration we paid in connection with the acquisitions principally lma and capital expenditures of 654 million partly offset by the proceeds from sales of businesses and assets of 667 million the proceeds from sales of businesses and assets include 451 million from the sale of our orthopedic business 168 million that we received as a working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of the agreement related to the sale of the cargo systems and container businesses of our former aerospace segment 45 million from the payment of a subordinated promissory note related to the sale of the marine business of our former commercial segment and proceeds of 03 million from the sale of a building 

 

cash flow from financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 649 million in 2012 primarily due to dividend payments of 556 million and approximately 176 million for contingent consideration payments related to our 2011 acquisition of vasonova and our 2012 acquisitions of semprus the assets of axiom and the ez blocker product line  partly offset by 90 million in proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options issued under our stock compensation plans 

 

financing arrangements 

 

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

  



  

the increase in percentage of net debt to total capital in 2013 compared to 2012 was largely due to the increase in total debt partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents the increase in total debt was a result of additional borrowings made during the year to fund acquisitions and the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily a result of improved operations 

 

fixed rate borrowings comprised 49 and 63 of total borrowings at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

 

 

our senior credit agreement and the indenture under which we issued our 6875 senior subordinated notes due 2019 the 2019 notes contain covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 401 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than 3501 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement at december 31 2013 our consolidated leverage ratio was 3601 and our interest coverage ratio was 8801 both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence the obligations under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed subject to certain exceptions by substantially all of the material domestic subsidiaries of the company and subject to certain exceptions and limitations secured by a pledge on substantially all of the equity interests owned by the company and each guarantor 

 

at december 31 2013  we had 6800 million in borrowings outstanding and approximately 59 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 8500 million revolving credit facility this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs and at certain times to help fund acquisitions the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in our senior credit agreement moreover additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur notwithstanding these restrictions we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december 31 2013 we would have been permitted 1467 million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31 2013 moreover additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 

 

as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior credit agreement and our 2019 notes and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements including the leverage and interest coverage ratios under our senior credit agreement throughout 2014 

 

in addition we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 50 0 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2013 the maximum amount available for borrowing under this facility was 439 million this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had 47 million of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

 

our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the “convertible notes” are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method we must calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period at the time we sold our convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the notes by in effect increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes from our economic standpoint to 7465 however under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap” since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is antidilutive we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 

 

 

under the treasury stock method changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation the following table provides examples of how changes in our stock price would impact the number of additional shares included in the denominator of the fully diluted earnings per share calculation total treasury stock method incremental shares the table also reflects the impact on the number of shares we could expect to issue upon concurrent settlement of the convertible notes the warrant and the convertible note hedge incremental shares issued by teleflex upon conversion 

 



 





 

our 3875 convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including in any fiscal quarter following an immediately preceding fiscal quarter in which the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter exceeds 130 of the conversion price of the notes approximately 7972 during the fourth quarter of 2013 the company’s closing stock price exceeded the 130 threshold described above and accordingly the convertible notes have been classified as a current liability as of december 31 2013 the determination of whether or not the convertible notes are convertible under such circumstances is made each quarter until maturity or conversion consequently the convertible notes may not be convertible in one or more future quarters if the common stock pricebased contingent conversion threshold is not met in such quarters in which case the convertible notes would again be classified as longterm debt unless another conversion event set forth in the convertible notes has occurred the company has elected a net settlement method to satisfy its conversion obligation under which the company may settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares while the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand and accessing our credit facility our use of these funds could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity the classification of the convertible notes as a current liability had no impact on our financial covenants 

 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

stock repurchase programs 

 

on june 14 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of our outstanding common stock repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generated from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition our senior credit facility and our 2019 notes limit our ability to repurchase shares and make other restricted payments accordingly these provisions may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization through december 31 2013 no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 

 

 

contractual obligations   

contractual obligations at december 31 2013 are as follows 

  



 



  

we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 552 million and 620 million as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 

 

in 2013 cash contributions to all defined benefit pen sion plans were 177 million and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be approximately 93 million in 2014 due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2014 

 

see notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

 

accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable  considering the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 

in light of the volatility in global economic markets during the past several years we instituted enhanced measures to facilitate customerbycustomer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts such measures included among others monthly credit control committee meetings at which customer credit risks are identified after review of among other things accounts that exceed specified credit limits payment delinquencies and other customer problems in addition for some of our nongovernment customers we instituted measures designed to reduce our risk exposures including issuing dunning letters reducing credit limits requiring that payments accompany orders and instituting legal action with respect to delinquent accounts with respect to government customers we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices 

some of our customers particularly in europe have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers for the most part in greece italy spain and portugal is the primary cause for the increase in the allowance at december 31 2013 these countries accounted for 31 of our total net current and longterm accounts receivable longterm receivables of 176 million are included in other assets on the balance sheet at december 31 2013 if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries deteriorate such that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain additional allowances may be required in future periods our allowance for doubtful accounts was 107 million at december 31 2013 and 78 million at december 31 2012 which was 33 and 24 respectively of gross accounts receivable 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could ma terially adversely affect our operating results moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

 

distributor rebates 

 

we offer rebates to certain distributors and reserve an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale in estimating rebates we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor’s rebate claim dis tributorspecific trend analyses contractual commitments including stated rebate rates historical experience and other relevant information we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future the reserve for estimated rebates was 78 million and 195 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease in accrued rebates in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to our continued migration to a common global erp platform specifically the integration of our lma and arrow businesses which resulted in reduced processing lag time from monthly to daily payments in many instances there were no significant changes in estimates recorded during the year we expect the reserve as of december 31 2013 to be paid within 90 days subsequent to yearend 

 

inventory utilization 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market w e maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory that reduces the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessiv e quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 

 

our inventory reserve was 324 million and 317 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively which equaled 89 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

  

accounting for longlived assets and investments 

  

we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections which involves significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

 

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

inta ngible assets may represent indefinitelived assets eg certain trademarks or brands determinablelived intangibles eg certain other trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies or goodwill of these only the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles assets primarily certain trademarks and brand names are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level  our reporting units are generally businesses one level below the respective operating segment we have a total of ten reporting units eight of which carry goodwill on their balance sheets in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing the qualitative assessment it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test alternatively we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the twostep impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis in the fourth quarter 2013 we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and test each of our reporting units whose assets include goodwill through the twostep quantitative impairment test as discussed below 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its carrying value in performing the first step we calculate fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows dcf of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar businesses in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed initially were being determined 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the income approach include 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry and 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future 

 

cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach were 1 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value and 2 the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2013 as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter 2013 impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit the discount rate was 100 for all reporting units a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units  

in addition our current stock market capitalization was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units plus a control premium to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately 32 which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 

no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above in the fourth quarter 2013 impairment test 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the go odwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle under the income approach significant changes in assumptions would be required for a reporting unit to fail the step one test for example an increase of over 10 in the discount rate or a decrease of over 10 percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required to indicate impairment for the reporting units nevertheless while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable and achievable the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected and as a result the estimated fair value may decline if our strategy andor new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges 

 

other intangible assets 

 

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology customer relationships and trade names the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method the excess earnings method measures economic benefit of an asset indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to the asset after appropriate returns are paid with respect to complementary or contributory assets the residual profit is taxeffected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream 

management test s indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing such qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amounts  alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test in the fourth quarter 2013 we performed a quantitative impairment test on all of our indefinitelived tradenames 

in connection with the quantitative impairment test management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value common among such approache s is the relief from royalty methodology described above under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible 

 

asset management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and terminal growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the trade names during the fourth quarter 2013 are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from the trade names ranged from 7 to 12 and a royalty rate of 4 was assumed discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 

no impairment in the carrying value of our indefinitelived intangible asset was evident as a result of the assessment of its respective fair value as determined under the methodology described above 

we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets eg customer relationships in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and reassessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finitelived assets by among other things assessing customer attrition rates 

 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

 

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits  several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

the weighted average assumptions for united states and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows 

 



 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

 



 

sharebased compensation 

 

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense related to stock options is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes 

 

into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final united states and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets  based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 865 million and 695 million at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the norma l course of business we are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that necessitate an adjustment become known specifically we are currently in the midst of examinations by the canadian german czech republic and austrian taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results

market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates shown below are the weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on interest rates in effect on december 31 2013 

 



 

a change of 10 in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately 44 million for the year ended december 31 2014 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we had no open forward contracts as of december 31 2013 in january 2014 we entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures these are primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the united states dollar or the euro the following table provides information regarding our open forward currency contracts entered into in january 2014 which mature during 2014 forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately 894 million 

 

forward currency contracts 



 

a strengthening of 10 in the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies would on a combined basis adversely impact the translation of our nonus subsidiary net earnings and transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries by approximately 215 million for the year ended december 31 2014

 item 1 business tableend teleflex incorporated is referred to herein as “we” “us” “our” “teleflex” and the “company” 

the company 

teleflex is a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers in more than 140 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies through 

 

  

  

  

  

 our research and development capabilities commitment to engineering excellence and focus on lowcost manufacturing enable us to consistently bring cost effective innovative products to market that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare our research and development initiatives focus on developing new innovative products for existing and new therapeutic applications as well as enhancements to and line extensions of existing products we introduced 20 new products and line extensions during 2012 our portfolio of existing products and pipeline of potential new products consist primarily of class i and class ii devices which require 510k clearance by the fda for sale in the united states we believe that 510k clearance reduces our research and development costs and risks and typically results in a shorter timetable for new product introductions as compared to the premarket approval or pma process that would be required for class iii devices 

over the past several years we have evolved into a pureplay medical technology company through an extensive acquisition and divestiture program we have significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical technology industry while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace and commercial markets 

during 2012 we continued to expand our presence in the anesthesia market through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma international nv “lma” a global market leader in laryngeal masks with a portfolio of innovative products used extensively in anesthesia and emergency care in addition consistent with our strategy to invest in new technologies and research and development to support our future growth we completed four latestage technology acquisitions in 2012 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the acquisitions 

  

during 2012 we sold the orthopedics business line of our oem segment see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the disposition 

our business 

we provide a broadbased platform of products which we categorize into four groups critical care surgical care cardiac care and oem and development services 

net revenues 

the following table sets forth our net revenues for 2012 2011 and 2010 by product category 

 

 our products generally serve three endmarkets hospitals and healthcare providers medical device manufacturers and home care these markets are influenced by a number of factors including demographics utilization and reimbursement patterns the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues for 2012 2011 and 2010 by end market 

 

 we sell and market our products in over 140 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues based on business unit location for 2012 2011 and 2010 derived from the major geographic areas we serve 

 

 additional geographic information is presented in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

we operate 25 manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in the czech republic malaysia mexico and the united states 

critical care 

we are a leading provider of specialty products for critical care which is predominantly comprised of singleuse products the large majority of our sales for singleuse products are made to the hospitalhealthcare provider market with a smaller percentage sold to alternate sites 

critical care is our largest product group representing 67 of net revenues in 2012 our products are used in a wide range of critical care procedures for vascular access anesthesia and airway management respiratory therapy treatment of urologic conditions and other specialty procedures 

  

vascular access products 

our vascular access products which accounted for 36 percent of our critical care net revenues in 2012 are generally catheterbased products used in a variety of clinical procedures to facilitate a variety of critical care therapies including the administration of intravenous medications and other therapies and the measurement of blood pressure and taking of blood samples through a single puncture site 

our vascular access catheters and related devices consist principally of central venous access catheters such as the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 many of our vascular access catheters are treated with the arrowgard or arrowgard blue plus antimicrobial surface treatments to reduce the risk of catheter related bloodstream infection arrowgard blue plus provides antimicrobial treatment of the interior lumens and hubs of each catheter 

we also provide a range of peripherally inserted central catheters or piccs which are soft flexible catheters inserted in the upper arm and advanced into the superior vena cava that are used to administer various types of intravenous medications and therapies our offerings include a pressure injectable peripherally inserted catheter which addresses the therapeutic need for a catheter that can withstand the higher pressures required by the injection of contrast media for ct scans the two newest additions to the picc portfolio in the united states include 

 

  

 as part of our ongoing efforts to meet physicians’ needs for safety and management of risk of infection in the hospital setting we offer many of our vascular access catheters in a maximal barrier precautions tray the tray is available for central venous cvc multi access mac and peripheral venous access picc and includes a full body drape coated or noncoated catheter and other accessories these kits were created to assist healthcare providers in complying with guidelines for reducing catheterrelated bloodstream infections that have been established by a variety of health regulatory agencies such as the centers for disease control and prevention and the joint commission on the accreditation of healthcare organizations 

  

our newest offering is the ergopack system designed to support consistent compliance with established guidelines for infection prevention and safety measures during catheter insertion the system provides components which are packaged in the tray in the order in which they will be needed during the procedure and incorporates features intended to enhance ease of use and patient and provider safety the ergopack system is offered for cvc picc mac and acute hemodialysis product offerings 

these advanced ergopack systems are designed to reduce procedural time and the risk of catheterrelated blood stream infection combined with the arrow vps™ system which has been approved by the fda as a replacement for chest xray following the insertion of a central venous catheter these products collectively offer the opportunity to reduce injuries to the healthcare provider expedite placement of a central venous catheter reduce patient exposure to xray expedite infusion of medication and reduce the risk of catheter related infection and thrombosis for the patient the intended net result is a more costeffective and safer approach to management of the insertion and use of central venous catheter 

anesthesia 

our anesthesia portfolio which includes airway and pain management products accounted for 23 percent of our critical care product net revenues in 2012 teleflex airway management products are used to maintain a patent airway for patients in surgical critical care and emergency settings these products are primarily marketed under the rusch ® brand and include endotracheal tubes tracheostomy tubes oral and nasal airways laryngoscopes face masks and anesthesia circuits 

in 2012 teleflex expanded our anesthesia franchise with the acquisition of lma international nv “lma” lma ® is a global market leader in laryngeal masks with a portfolio of innovative products used extensively in anesthesia and emergency care the addition of this business significantly strengthens and expands our global anesthesia product portfolio providing opportunities with respect to key clinical us and international call points while also further strengthening our group purchasing organizations gpo relationships 

teleflex also acquired and commercialized a latestage airway management technology in 2012 the rusch ® ezblocker™ disposable catheter is an innovative technology that improves teleflex’s competitive position the ezblocker catheter is used in lung isolation procedures to achieve onelung ventilation and is designed to provide benefits that overcome the significant drawbacks of currently used products the design of the ezblocker catheter allows for use in combination with a standard endotracheal tube and enables positioning over the carina we acquired the device in may of 2012 

our pain management or regional anesthesia products include epidural catheters and trays spinal needles and trays and peripheral nerve block needles catheters and trays teleflex’s comprehensive portfolio of pain management products are marketed under the arrow ® brand and are designed to provide pain relief during a broad range of surgical and obstetric procedures to help clinicians better manage each patient’s individual pain while reducing complications and associated costs 

in 2012 we strengthened our pain management portfolio with the launch of the arrow ® flextip ® plus multiport catheter an epidural catheter that uses the same technology as our arrow ® flextip plus open tip singleport catheter which has been proven to significantly reduce complications such as vein cannulations and paresthesia the unique polyurethane flextip plus multiport catheter provides a solution for clinicians who believe a better block is achieved with a multiorifice catheter rather than with a singlehole open tip catheter 

in late 2012 the anesthesia business also launched the arrow ® flexblock™ continuous peripheral nerve block catheter which is intended for clinicians who use ultrasoundguidance when placing continuous peripheral nerve block catheters the flexblock catheter’s coilreinforced polyurethane body is designed to help improve continuous nerve blocking by providing clinicians with 

  

an echogenic catheter the coil reinforcement also makes flexblock kink resistant to better maintain patency even in some situations that might cause ordinary nylon catheters to fail the unique tuohy introducer needles are designed to enable clinicians to retract the catheter back into the needle if necessary without withdrawing the needle and resticking the patient 

respiratory care 

teleflex’s respiratory products accounted for 16 percent of our critical care product net revenues in 2012 our hudson rci brand has been a leader in respiratory care for more than 65 years providing innovative products that are designed to help clinicians improve patient outcomes while reducing costs our comprehensive portfolio is used in a variety of care settings and includes 

 

  

  

  

 in 2012 we launched several new products to complement the popular conchatherm ® neptune ® heated humidifier the conchatherm neptune enables clinicians to optimize humidification to improve patient outcomes featuring adjustable temperature and gradient control the conchatherm ® neptune ® supports clinical practice guidelines for humidification delivery during invasive and noninvasive ventilation because of the conchatherm ® neptune ® ’s flexibility in operation therapists can easily adjust the humidifier after routine clinical assessments 

launched in late 2012 isogard ® circuit technology is used in conjunction with the conchatherm neptune this disposable circuit promotes a closed system ventilation approach by integrating reservoirs into the breathing circuit that collect excess condensate or secretions which can be easily emptied with a suction wand this closed system minimizes circuit breaks which reduces the risk of cross contamination and eliminates the need to interrupt ventilation as a result the isogard circuit technology helps to reduce both patient and clinician exposure to mucosal secretions and supports strategies for reducing the risk of ventilatorassociated pneumonia in acute care hospitals 

in 2012 teleflex also launched the softech ® plus line of adult pediatric infant and neonatal oxygen cannulas that feature a new material blend resulting in softness that provides optimal patient comfort with an ideal fit the softech plus’ nondehp construction helps customers comply with evolving patient safety standards 

specialty markets 

teleflex’s specialty products accounted for 25 percent of our critical care product net revenues in 2012 our specialty markets business sells respiratory anesthesia interventional access and urology products into the homecare and other alternative channels of care 

our line of urology products provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and home care markets our product portfolio consists principally of a wide range of catheters including foley intermittent external and suprapubic urine collectors catheterization accessories and products for operative endurology marketed under the rusch ® brand name 

our urology business serves home care markets and patient care outside of the hospital over the past few years we have expanded our offerings for these markets to include a wider range of intermittent catheters catheter insertion kits and accessories used by quadriplegic and paraplegic people many of these products are designed to support patient safety and infection prevention 

  

efforts for example we market an intermittent catheter with hydrophilic coating an ergothan tip protective sleeve and saline solution in our emea region in the united states we recently expanded our hydrophilic coated intermittent catheter line to include female lengths as well as complete sterile insertion kits for both standard male and female lengths the uncoated intermittent catheter line in the united states was also expanded recently to include a full range of female length catheters and a complete offering of sterile insertion kits for the standard male coudé and female styles 

home care markets are subject to local and regional reimbursement regulations that can impact volumes and pricing for example in the united states reimbursement regulations were implemented in 2008 that permit reimbursement for up to 200 catheters per month replacing the previous limit of four catheters per month the change promoted a shift from reuseable catheters with their inherent risk of infections to singleuse intermittent catheters sales of our intermittent catheters in the united states have benefited from this change in reimbursement policy 

the gibeck ® trachvent ® hme heat  moisture exchanger family of products are designed to provide excellent humidification for spontaneously breathing tracheostomized patients in november 2012 we introduced the gibeck ® trach vent t with 5mm collar this hme provides optimal moisture via gibeck microwell paper while accommodating all patient sizes 

interventional access products include tunneled hemodialysis catheters acute hemodialysis catheters percutaneous transluminal angioplasty pta balloons embolectomy balloons a mechanical thrombectomy device reinforced percutaneous sheath introducers and diagnostic and drainage kits 

the line of tunneled dialysis catheters offers antegrade and retrograde catheters in the split tipped arrow edge catheter and the arrow cannon ii plus catheter in the step tip catheter the antegrade and retrograde nextstep catheter is offered with a reverse port configuration the acute hemodialysis catheters are treated with the arrowgard antimicrobial surface treatments to reduce the risk of catheter related bloodstream infection in may of 2012 we acquired semprus biosciences a biomedical company that developed sustain™ a longlasting covalently bonded nonleaching polymer designed to reduce infections and thrombus related complications our tunneled hemodialysis catheters will be treated with sustain™ in order to reduce the attachment of platelets and blood proteins at the device surface 

in connection with the acquisition of hotspur technologies a developer of catheterbased technologies designed to restore blood flow in patients with obstructed vessels we obtained the visiovalve™ injection system a patented technology that is the basis for a portfolio of multifunction catheters such as the gpscath balloon dilitation catheter the gpscath is a specialty twoinone device intended for dialysis access and peripheral vascular interventions that enables physicians to conduct angioplasty and inject fluid while maintaining guidewire position 

surgical care 

surgical care which is predominantly comprised of singleuse products represented 19 percent of net revenues in 2012 our surgical products include ligation and closure products including appliers clips and sutures used in a variety of surgical procedures access ports used in minimally invasive surgical procedures including robotic surgery and fluid management products used for chest drainage our surgical products also include reusable handheld instruments for general and specialty surgical procedures we market surgical products under the deknatel pilling pleurevac taut and weck brand names in april 2012 we expanded our surgical product offerings through acquisition of technology enabling us to launch the weck efx tm endo fascial closure system a port site closure device used in laparoscopic surgical procedures 

hemolok a significant part of the weck portfolio is a unique locking polymer ligation clip that combines the security of a suture with the speed of a metal clip for open and laparoscopic surgery hemolok clips have special applications in robotic laparoscopic and cardiovascular surgery 

  

in addition to the launch of the weck efx tm endo fascial closure system recently introduced products include a new comprehensive line of bladeless laparoscopic access ports under the weck brand featuring optical trocars universal balloons and a line of sustainable reusable obturators and deklene maxx a line of high performing polypropylene sutures utilized extensively in cardiovascular surgery 

cardiac care 

cardiac care products accounted for approximately 5 percent of net revenues in 2012 products in this category include diagnostic catheters and capital equipment our diagnostic catheters include thermodilution and wedge pressure catheters specialized angiographic catheters such as berman and reverse berman catheters therapeutic delivery catheters such as temporary pacing catheters sheaths for femoral and transradial aortic access used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and intraaortic balloon or iab catheters capital equipment includes our intraaortic balloon pump or iabp consoles iabp products are used to augment oxygen delivery to the cardiac muscle and reduce the oxygen demand after cardiac surgery serious heart attack or interventional procedures 

the iab and iabp product lines feature the autocat 2 wave console and the fiberoptix catheter which together utilize fiber optic technology for arterial pressure signal acquisition and enable the patented wave timing algorithm to support the broadest range of patient heart rhythms including severely arrhythmic patients 

oem and development services 

customized extrusion performance fibers and devices sold to original equipment manufacturers or oems represented 9 percent of our net revenues in 2012 teleflex medical oem designs and delivers products that have applications for a wide variety of organs and systems in the human body we offer comprehensive product development and outsourcing services which include design engineering regulatory affairs prototyping manufacturing assembly and packaging 

our oem products which are marketed under the tfx oem brand name include custommanufactured extrusions catheters introducers dilators and other devices oem also markets specialty sutures resins and yarns for cardiovascular and orthopedic applications under the deknatel brand 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we have grown through an active program of development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and through acquisitions of companies with related market technology or industry expertise throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

over the past several years we have significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace and commercial markets the most significant of these transactions occurred in 2007 with our acquisition of arrow international a leading global supplier of catheterbased medical technology products used for vascular access and cardiac care and the divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses our acquisition of arrow significantly expanded our singleuse product offerings for critical care enhanced our global footprint and added to our research and development capabilities with the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we have become exclusively a medical device company 

we expect to continue to increase the relative composition of our business through a combination of portfolio management and organic growth initiatives from time to time we explore and engage in discussions regarding acquisitions that would augment our existing technology platform 

  

change in reporting segments and business unit structure 

effective january 1 2012 we changed our segment reporting from a single reportable segment to four reportable segments as initially changed our reportable segments included three geographicallybased segments north america emea representing our operations in europe the middle east and africa and ajla representing our asian and latin american operations and a fourth reportable segment comprised of our oem business in addition in the first quarter of 2012 we changed the number of our reporting units previously we had six reporting units comprised of north america emea oem japan asia pacific and latin america in 2012 in addition to establishing a new north america segment we established five reporting units within that segment vascular anesthesiarespiratory cardiac surgical and specialty due to the change in the reporting unit structure in north america we were required to conduct a goodwill impairment test with respect to each of the north american reporting units in the first quarter of 2012 and determined that the goodwill of three of the reporting units was impaired as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 332 million in the first quarter of 2012 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the goodwill impairment 

during the third quarter of 2012 due to changes in our management and internal reporting structure our latin america operations were moved from the ajla segment into the north america segment as a result of this change the north america segment is now referred to as the americas segment and the ajla segment is now referred to as the asia segment the change did not affect our reporting unit structure all prior comparative periods have been restated to reflect this change see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the segments 

government regulation 

government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products and the products sold by our customers that incorporate our products the us food and drug administration and government agencies in other countries regulate the approval manufacturing sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products for more information see “we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition” appearing in item 1a “risk factors” of this report 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us and have access to significantly greater financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness our competitors include c r bard inc covidien and carefusion 

sales and marketing 

our products are sold directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces and through independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

  

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass these cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and our efforts to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks include but are not limited to the following 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us have a broad range of competitive products participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as our inability to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that are more effective than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements and the failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursements for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse 

  

our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the extent of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected 

we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursements to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursements could harm our business by reducing potential customers’ selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursements for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our existing products and potential new products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims that may be brought against us and recalls which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore as a medical device company we face an inherent risk of damage to our reputation if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the cost to defend against these lawsuits may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by regulatory authorities to participate in a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may experience lost sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover our reputation could be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern the development design approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to manufacturing shutdowns product shortages delays in product manufacturing product seizures recalls operating restrictions withdrawal or suspension of required licenses and prohibitions against exporting of products to or importing 

  

products from countries outside the united states we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we generally must first receive either 510k clearance or approval of a premarket approval or pma application from the fda in order for us to obtain 510k clearance the fda must determine that our proposed product is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness obtaining pma approval is more difficult requiring us to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based in part on data obtained in human clinical trials similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda or a foreign governmental authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future product clearances or approvals the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application violations of fda requirements for medical devices could result in fda enforcement actions including warning letters fines delays in obtaining new regulatory clearances product seizures or recalls injunctions advisories or other field actions andor operating restrictions medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses promoting a device for an offlabel use could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign government authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the fda’s quality system regulation which requires periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures as well as complaint evaluations and investigation the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and may require the reporting of recalls or other field safety corrective actions issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in warning letters manufacturing shutdowns product shortages product seizures or recalls fines and delays in product manufacturing and may require significant resources to resolve 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring facility consolidations realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including the realignment of our north american organizational structure facility consolidations and reductions in our workforce while we have realized some efficiencies from these actions we may not realize the benefits of these initiatives to the extent we anticipated further such 

  

benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we commenced efforts in 2012 to transition our businesses to a single enterprise resource planning or erp system in the event we encounter any problems with this transition we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of the erp system could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our strategic initiatives including acquisitions may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income 

our strategies include making significant investments to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations technologies services and products and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute the relevant products at previous levels or at all in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all furthermore our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to attract train develop and retain key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in 

  

part on our ability to attract train develop and retain other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our inability to attract train develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets including the european sovereign debt crisis combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions including the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets in recent years in particular the european sovereign debt crisis and its collateral effects on global financial markets may have a negative impact on our business the credit and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years leading to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending these recessionary conditions have caused customers to reduce delay or cancel purchases of our products and services while recent economic indicators suggest improvement in the united states and global economy we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more normalized spending behaviors if the recessionary conditions worsen our customers may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us 

adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause them to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us such as shortening the required payment period for our accounts payable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us these types of actions could significantly affect our liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally our customers particularly in the european region have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided which may lead to collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs however in light of the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets including the european sovereign debt crisis combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets there is a risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 our aggregate net receivables in italy spain portugal and greece were 1010 million and 1085 million respectively in 2012 2011 and 2010 net revenues from these countries was approximately 9 of total net revenues in each of the years and average days that accounts receivable were outstanding were 288 318 and 217 days respectively although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful 

  

accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our operating results moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

 

  

  

  

 if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “healthcare reform act” imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers effective march 30 2013 such information will be made publicly available in a searchable format beginning september 30 2013 in addition device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california massachusetts and vermont mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation 

  

for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements and may result in increased compliance costs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare reform act enacted in march 2010 substantially changes the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the healthcare reform act 

 

  

  

  

 based on our current product portfolio and sales volumes we currently estimate the impact of the 23 deductible excise tax to be approximately 150 million annually however we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the healthcare reform act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

research and development for some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development and use of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations outside the united states in a number of countries including canada belgium the czech republic france germany ireland malaysia mexico and singapore as of december 31 2012 approximately 39 of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states and 73 of our fulltime and temporary employees were employed in countries outside of the united states in addition in 2012 approximately 49 of our net revenues based on business unit location were derived from operations outside the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which among other things are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments and to prevent the establishment of “off the books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws however despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents or employees or agents of businesses or operations we may acquire violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also could be subject to severe penalties including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines and the disgorgement of profits the imposition of a courtappointed monitor the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in us government contracts 

the risks relating to our foreign operations may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

  

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenue from products manufactured in and sold into nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our us dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currency in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers and thus adversely affect their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect our results 

as a company with significant operations outside of the united states we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate our effective tax rate may however differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in addition unfavorable results of tax audits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous us and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states there is no guarantee that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information or copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without 

  

authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be required to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages and to cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may lead us to incur significant costs and have an adverse effect on our business 

we also are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 

  

  

 these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover we may become subject to additional environmental claims which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our past present or future business activities which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 approximately 5 of our net revenues were generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining 

  

agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2012 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 9700 million 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs we may be forced to 

 

  

  

  

 we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

the credit agreement governing our credit facilities and the indenture governing our 6875 senior subordinated notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the credit agreement governing our credit facilities also contains financial covenants a breach of any covenants under any one or more of these debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debts in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings compliance with debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

the contingent conversion features of our convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2010 we issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 which we refer to as the “convertible notes” the convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including the attainment of 130 of the conversion price approximately 7972 of the company’s closing stock price during a certain number of days at the end of a fiscal quarter the company’s closing stock price has recently approached this amount which increases the possibility that the convertible notes could become convertible in the near future at which point the convertible notes would be classified as a current liability and would result in a material reduction of our net working capital the company has elected a net settlement method to satisfy its conversion obligation under which the company may settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares the company believes that it has the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand accessing our credit facility or raising money in the capital markets however doing so could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity see “convertible notes” under note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the convertible notes 

the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with third parties which we refer to as the hedge counterparties the hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the convertible notes and are expected to reduce our exposure to potential dilution with respect to our common stock andor reduce our exposure to potential cash 

  

payments that may be required to be made by us upon conversion of the convertible notes separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock with the hedge counterparties with a strike price of 74648 subject to customary antidilution adjustments pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue shares of our common stock the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or if we so elect obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants 

in connection with establishing its initial hedges of the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates entered into various cashsettled overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the convertible notes the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates may in their sole discretion with or without notice modify their hedge positions from time to time and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to the conversion of the convertible notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution and we will be subject to the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of each hedge counterparty will not be secured by any collateral if a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock market price and in volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by a hedge counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes which could lower the price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2012 we had outstanding approximately 410 million shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 11 million shares of our common stock of which approximately 06 million were vested as of that date approximately 04 million of restricted stock awards which are expected to vest over the next three years and approximately 20000 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan in addition a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options upon conversion of the convertible notes and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock issuable upon any conversion of the convertible notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the anticipated issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or 

  

conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents delaware law and our convertible notes could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in the convertible notes and the indenture governing the convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if an acquisition event constitutes a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in addition if an acquisition event constitutes a “makewhole fundamental change” as defined in the indenture we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such acquisition event in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers in more than 140 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures we are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure 

we categorize our products into four groups critical care surgical care cardiac care and original equipment manufacturer and development services “oem” critical care representing our largest product group includes medical devices used in vascular access anesthesia urology and respiratory care applications surgical care includes surgical instruments and devices and cardiac care includes cardiac assist devices and equipment oem designs and manufactures instruments and devices for other medical device manufacturers 

over the past several years we have evolved into a pureplay medical technology company through an extensive acquisition and divestiture program we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical technology industry while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace and commercial markets the following is a listing of our more significant acquisitions and divestitures that have occurred since 2010 with respect to divested businesses listed below we have reported results of operations cash flows and gains losses on the disposition of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our significant divestitures

 change in reporting segments and business unit structure 

effective january 1 2012 we changed our segment reporting from a single reportable segment to four reportable segments three of which are geographically based as initially changed the three geographic segments were north america emea representing our operations in europe the middle east and africa and ajla representing our asian and latin american operations the fourth reportable segment is comprised of our oem business in addition in the first quarter of 2012 we changed the number of our reporting units in 2011 we had six reporting units comprised of north america emea oem japan asia pacific and latin america in 2012 in addition to establishing a new north america segment we established five reporting units in that segment vascular anesthesiarespiratory cardiac surgical and specialty due to the change in the reporting unit structure in north america we were required to conduct a goodwill impairment test with respect to each of the north american reporting units in the first quarter of 2012 and determined that the goodwill of three of the reporting units vascular anesthesiarespiratory and cardiac was impaired as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 332 million in the first quarter of 2012 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the goodwill impairment 

the impairment charge does not reflect any significant business change or any change in our expectations regarding the future operating results or liquidity of the north american segment rather it is attributable to the creation of five new reporting units out of the north american reporting unit in 

  

the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined the fair value of the north american reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus there was no further analysis to determine if there was an impairment of goodwill in the first quarter of 2012 we determined the relative fair values of each reporting unit and allocated the goodwill assigned to the north american reporting unit to each of the new reporting units based on relative fair value we subsequently allocated all assets and liabilities other than goodwill to the reporting unit based on specific identification and the reporting unit’s respective operating activities the resulting allocation of the carrying amounts was different from the allocation of the relative fair value accordingly while there was very little change between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 in the total fair value and carrying value of the sum of the five reporting units compared to the north american reporting unit the relative values were different for each of the five new reporting units for some reporting units the fair value exceeded the carrying value and in other situations the carrying value exceeded fair value of the reporting unit which resulted in further analysis to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and the resulting impairment charge this charge was primarily attributable to the fact that the fair value of assets other than goodwill increased which results in a decrease in the assumed fair value of goodwill 

in the third quarter of 2012 due to changes in our management and internal reporting structure our latin america operations were moved from the ajla segment into the north america segment as a result of this change the north america segment is now referred to as the americas segment and the ajla segment is now referred to as the asia segment the change did not affect our reporting unit structure segment disclosures for all prior comparative periods have been restated to reflect this change see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the segments 

health care reform 

on march 23 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law this legislation will have a significant impact on our business for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare which could negatively affect pricing of our products in addition commencing in 2013 the legislation imposes a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices as implementation of this tax begins and as the taxing authorities clarify aspects of the application of the tax relevant to us we will be in a better position to ascertain its impact on our business we currently estimate the impact of the medical device excise tax will be approximately 15 million annually beginning in 2013 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions have had adverse impacts on market activities including among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity and reduced demand for products and services in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities and we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies and the consolidation of facilities although on a consolidated basis the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last three years the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit and public sector austerity measures in response to growing public budget deficits could adversely affect our operations in the future as described below the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below 

hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels 

  

and generally have not replenished inventories to prerecession levels the impact of these actions is most pronounced in capital goods markets which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses more recently the economic environment has improved somewhat but has not returned to prerecession levels and challenges persist particularly in some european countries as discussed below approximately 91 percent of our net revenues come from singleuse products used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers 

in europe some countries have taken austerity measures due to the current economic climate elective surgeries have been delayed and hospital budgets have been reduced in certain countries mainly germany we have seen changes in the local reimbursement to home care patients and pricing impacts on business awarded through the tendering process these markets have introduced more buying groups and group purchasing organizations or gpos resulting in reductions in commodity product pricing it is possible that funding for publically funded healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which has resulted in a slowdown in payments to us we believe this situation will continue and may worsen unless and until these countries are able to find alternative means of funding their respective public healthcare sectors 

in asia recovery from the global recession has varied by country china has announced plans for major healthcare investment targeted at second tier cities and hospitals which may provide future growth opportunities for us while slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan is expected to limit growth in that market 

results of operations

revenues 

information regarding net revenues by product group is provided in the following table 

 

   

  

the following table presents the percentage increases or decreases in product group net revenues during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 compared to the respective prior years on a constant currency basis the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on those revenues and the total increase or decrease in net revenues for the periods presented taking into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as defined in note 1 below 

 

  

 

 comparison of 2012 and 2011 

net revenues increased 39 in 2012 to 15510 million from 14925 million in 2011 the 585 million increase in net revenues was largely due to higher volume approximately 397 million reflecting core growth in all segments acquisitions approximately 253 million primarily from our acquisition of lma approximately 244 million price increases approximately 186 million across all segments and new products approximately 175 million in north america and emea these increases were partly offset by the 423 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2012 

critical care net revenues increased 37 in 2012 to 10405 million from 10038 million in 2011 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates net revenues increased 66 over the corresponding prior year period the increase in net revenues was due to higher sales of vascular access anesthesia urology and respiratory products 

surgical care net revenues increased 50 in 2012 to 2911 million from 2774 million in 2011 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates net revenues increased 78 over the corresponding prior year period the increase in net revenues was due to higher sales of ligation general surgical instruments and closure products 

cardiac care net revenues decreased 17 in 2012 to 786 million from 799 million in 2011 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates net revenues increased 22 over the corresponding prior year period the increase in net revenues was due to higher sales of intraaortic pumps and catheters 

  

oem net revenues increased 82 in 2012 to 1403 million from 1296 million in 2011 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates net revenues increased 95 over the corresponding prior year period the increase in net revenues was due to higher sales of specialty suture and catheter fabrication products 

comparison of 2011 and 2010 

net revenues increased 68 in 2011 to 14925 million from 13977 million in 2010 the 948 million increase in net revenues was largely due to higher volumes in all segments and favorable foreign currency rates approximately 327 million in addition net revenues in 2010 were lower by approximately 168 million due to the recall of custom iv tubing during the first quarter of 2010 

critical care net revenues increased 64 in 2011 to 10038 million from 9434 million in 2010 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates net revenues increased 41 primarily due to higher sales of vascular access and anesthesia products in north america europe and asialatin america respiratory products in north america europe and asia and urology products in europe and latin america in addition net revenues in 2010 were lower by approximately 168 million due to the recall of custom iv tubing during the first quarter of 2010 

surgical care net revenues increased 56 in 2011 to 2774 million from 2627 million in 2010 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates net revenues increased 30 principally due to higher sales of ligation products in each of our regions 

cardiac care net revenues increased 133 in 2011 to 799 million from 706 million in 2010 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates net revenues increased 100 largely attributable to higher sales of intraaortic balloon pump catheters in each of our regions 

oem net revenues increased 95 in 2011 to 1296 million from 1184 million in 2010 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates net revenues increased 86 due to higher sales of specialty suture and catheter fabrication products 

gross profit 

 

 comparison of 2012 and 2011 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased 07 in 2012 to 482 from 475 in 2011 the increase is primarily due to price increases in all segments and lower manufacturing costs in north america in addition 2011 included charges related to stock keeping unit “sku” rationalization to eliminate skus based on low sales volume or insufficient margins to help improve future profitability the increases were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates higher manufacturing costs in emea and inventory writeoffs for excess and slow moving product and damaged product in asia approximately 49 million 

comparison of 2011 and 2010 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased 11 in 2011 to 475 from 486 in 2010 the decrease was primarily related to higher manufacturing raw material and fuelrelated freight costs and a 20 million pretax charge to cost of goods sold attributable to the sku rationalization implemented at the end of 2011 our ability to increase prices to offset the impact of higher commodity costs has been mixed as price increases in asia latin america and north america were offset by price erosion in europe during 2011 

  

selling general and administrative 

 

 comparison of 2012 and 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 306 million in 2012 the increase is primarily due to higher general and administrative costs across all segments principally on higher employee related costs 151 million incremental operating expenses associated with the businesses acquired 147 million a 76 million loss on foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into in anticipation of the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma acquisition related costs 72 million and higher selling costs 48 million driven by the increased revenue volumes and support of new products these increases were partly offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rates 111 million in addition 2011 expenses included increases in the valuation allowance with respect to the greek government bonds that we received in 2011 in settlement of trade receivables due to us from sales to the public hospital system in greece 45 million approximately 22 million of net separation costs for our former ceo comprised of 55 million of payments under his employment agreement less approximately 33 million of stock option and restricted share forfeitures and increases in litigation reserves 17 million for additional information on the greek government bonds see note 11 “fair value measurement” to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

during the third quarter of 2012 we entered into forward exchange contracts for singapore dollars and us dollars in anticipation of the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma in accordance with fasb guidance a forecasted transaction is not eligible for hedge accounting if the forecasted transaction involves a business combination therefore gains and losses relating to this arrangement were recognized as incurred we realized a pretax loss of 76 million upon settlement of the forward exchange contracts for additional information regarding the acquisition of lma and the forward exchange contracts see note 3 and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

comparison of 2011 and 2010 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 284 in 2011 compared to 289 in 2010 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2011 as compared with 2010 was primarily attributable to increased spending related to sales marketing and clinical education initiatives of 185 million and a 45 million loss pertaining to our zerocoupon greek government bonds in addition increases in litigation reserves during 2011 increased selling general and administrative expenses by approximately 17 million the above increases were partially offset by the fact that the 2010 period included approximately 100 million of costs associated with the product recall and remediation activities of our custom iv tubing product 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2011 also include approximately 22 million of net separation costs for our former chief executive officer comprised of 55 million of payments under his employment agreement less approximately 33 million of stock option and restricted share forfeitures 

the overall increase in selling general and administrative expenses for 2011 also included 49 million of costs related to vasonova a company we acquired in january 2011 

  

research and development 

 

 comparison of 2012 and 2011 

the increase in research and development expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 principally reflects continued investment in the new technologies obtained in the second quarter of 2012 through acquisitions and increased investments related to vascular products in north america 

comparison of 2011 and 2010 

the increase in research and development expenses during 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflect increased investments related to catheter tip positioning technologies 

interest income and expense 

 

 interest expense decreased 07 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower average interest rates partially offset by approximately 15 million higher average outstanding debt 

interest expense decreased 95 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a reduction of approximately 156 million in average outstanding debt and lower average interest rates 

loss on extinguishments of debt 

 

 during 2011 we recorded losses on the extinguishment of debt of 154 million as a result of the prepayment in the first quarter of 2011 of the remaining outstanding principal amount of our senior notes issued in 2004 the “2004 notes” and the 125 million repayment in the second quarter of 2011 of term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility in connection with the prepayment of our 2004 notes we recognized debt extinguishment costs of approximately 146 million related to the prepayment “makewhole” amount of 139 million paid to the holders of the 2004 notes and the writeoff of 07 million of unamortized debt issuance costs that we incurred prior to the prepayment of the 2004 notes during the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a 08 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the 125 million repayment of term loan borrowings 

in 2010 we recognized losses on the extinguishment of debt of 466 million as a result of our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 and prepayment of notes in the fourth quarter of 2010 in connection with our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 we prepaid our senior notes issued in 2007 the “2007 notes” and together with the 2004 notes the “senior notes” and recognized debt extinguishment costs of approximately 288 million comprised of a prepayment makewhole fee of 281 million the writeoff of 06 million of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions and related legal fees also in connection with our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 we prepaid 200 million of our senior credit facility and recognized additional losses on the extinguishment of debt of 16 million related to the writeoff of 

  

unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions in the fourth quarter of 2010 we prepaid 1658 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2004 notes and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 163 million comprised of a prepayment makewhole fee of 155 million the writeoff of 07 million of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions and related legal fees see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

taxes on income from continuing operations 

 

 the effective income tax rate in 2012 was 99 compared to 178 in 2011 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2012 was 164 million compared to 258 million in 2011 the decrease in the effective tax rate was impacted by the company’s ability to deduct only 45 million of the 332 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2012 accordingly the reduction in the tax rate reflects the company’s ability to realize only a limited tax benefit related to this charge 

the effective tax rate in 2011 was 178 compared to 162 in 2010 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2011 was 258 million compared to 169 million in 2010 the increase in the effective tax rate reflects lower beneficial discrete charges offset by a tax benefit with respect to foreign earnings 

restructuring and other impairment charges 

 

 lma restructuring program 

in connection with the acquisition of lma we formulated a plan related to the future integration of lma and our businesses the integration plan focuses on the closure of lma corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing sales marketing and distribution functions in north america europe and asia we estimate that an aggregate of up to approximately 16 million will be charged to restructuring and other impairment charges over the term of this restructuring program of this amount 5 million relates to employee termination costs 10 million relates to termination of certain distributor agreements and 1 million relates to facility closure costs and other actions during 2012 we incurred restructuring charges of 25 million under this program primarily related to employee severance costs we expect to realize annual pretax savings in the range of 1520 million by the end of 2015 when these restructuring actions are complete 

2012 restructuring charges 

we regularly evaluate opportunities to consolidate facilities lower costs and optimize operating efficiencies in 2012 we identified opportunities to improve our supply chain strategy by consolidating three of our north american warehouses into one centralized warehouse and lower costs and improve operating efficiencies through the termination of certain distributor agreements in europe the closure of certain north american facilities and workforce reductions these projects will entail costs related to reductions in force contract terminations related to distributor agreements and leases and facility 

  

closure and other costs during 2012 we incurred restructuring charges of 24 million and as of december 31 2012 we had recorded a reserve 22 million related to these projects we expect to complete the projects over a one year period we anticipate future payments of 59 million and incurring additional charges of 37 million related to these initiatives 

2011 restructuring program 

in 2011 we initiated a restructuring program at three facilities to consolidate operations and reduce costs in connection with this program we recorded contract termination costs of approximately 26 million associated with a lease termination as we vacated 50 of the premises during 2011 in addition we recorded approximately 04 million for employee termination benefits in connection with workforce consolidations we expect to incur additional contract termination costs of approximately 27 million when we have completely exited a leased facility the payment of the lease contract termination costs will continue until 2015 

2007 arrow integration program 

in connection with our acquisition of arrow international inc “arrow” in 2007 we formulated a plan to integrate arrow and our other businesses costs related to actions that affected employees and facilities of teleflex were charged to earnings and included in restructuring and other impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations in 2012 we reversed approximately 20 million of contract termination costs related to a settlement of a dispute involving the termination of a european distributor agreement that was established in connection with our acquisition of arrow as of december 31 2012 we expect future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the arrow integration plan if any will be nominal 

impairment charges 

during 2011 we recognized net impairment charges of 25 million related to the decline in value of our investments in affiliates that are considered to be other than temporary in making this determination we considered multiple factors including our intent and ability to hold investments operating losses of investees that demonstrate an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments the investee’s liquidity and cash position and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services 

for additional information regarding our restructuring programs and impairment charges see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

goodwill impairment 

in the first quarter of 2012 we changed our north america reporting unit structure from a single reporting unit to five reporting units comprised of vascular anesthesiarespiratory cardiac surgical and specialty we allocated the assets and liabilities of our north america segment among the new reporting units based on their respective operating activities and then allocated goodwill among the reporting units using a relative fair value approach as required by fasb accounting standards codification “asc” topic 350 

following this allocation we performed goodwill impairment tests on these new reporting units in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of these tests we determined that three of the reporting units in our north america segment were impaired and we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 220 million in our vascular reporting unit 107 million in our anesthesiarespiratory reporting unit and 5 million in our cardiac reporting unit in the first quarter of 2012

americas segment operating profit increased 25 in 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 the increase reflects the favorable impact of higher net revenues and lower manufacturing costs these increases were partly offset by higher selling general and administrative expenses 285 million and higher research and development expenses 76 million the increase in selling general and administrative expenses is largely due to employee related costs operating expenses and acquisition costs associated with the businesses acquired in 2012 117 million and higher sales and marketing expenses approximately 40 million primarily in support of new products the increase in research and development expenses is due to costs associated with the new technologies obtained in the second quarter of 2012 through acquisitions 56 million in addition 2011 included a sku rationalization charge approximately 13 million to eliminate skus based on low sales volumes or insufficient margins 

  

emea 

emea net revenues decreased 29 in 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 the decrease reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates approximately 391 million the foreign currency exchange rate impact was partly offset by higher volume of approximately 131 million primarily in urology surgical and anesthesia products partly offset by a decline in cardiac products 2012 acquisitions 56 million primarily lma new product sales 35 million and price increases 18 million 

emea segment operating profit decreased 259 in 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 the decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 133 million operating expenses and acquisition costs associated with 2012 acquisitions 87 million a loss on foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into in anticipation of the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of lma 76 million and higher manufacturing costs partly offset by higher revenues in addition emea segment operating profit in 2011 included an increase in the valuation allowance related to the greek government bonds 45 million 

asia 

asia net revenues increased 161 in 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 the increase was due to higher volume of approximately 155 million mostly due to sales growth in the asia pacific region particularly in china 51 million related to acquisitions in 2012 primarily lma and 41 million related to price increases 

asia segment operating profit increased 242 in 2012 compared to the corresponding period in 2011 the increase is due to the increase in revenues partly offset by inventory writeoffs for excess slow moving and damaged product approximately 49 million and operating expenses and acquisitions costs associated with acquisitions we completed in 2012 14 million

comparison of 2011 and 2010 

americas 

americas net revenues increased 28 in 2011 compared to the corresponding period in 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher sales of vascular access and anesthesia and respiratory products in addition net revenues in 2010 were approximately 168 million lower due to the recall of custom iv tubing during the first quarter of 2010 

americas segment operating profit decreased 111 in 2011 compared to the corresponding period in 2010 the decrease was due to higher manufacturing raw material and fuel related freight costs the sku rationalization charge approximately 13 million increased spending related to marketing and clinical education approximately 68 million and higher research and development expenses 55 million primarily related to catheter tip positioning technologies in addition 2010 segment operating profit reflected approximately 44 million of costs associated with the product recall and remediation activities related to our custom iv tubing product

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets 

we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs however as discussed above in global economic conditions the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets including the european sovereign debt crisis combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets there is a risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity consequently we continue to monitor our credit risk related to countries in europe as of december 31 2012 our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in italy spain portugal and greece were 706 million compared to 788 million as of december 31 2011 in 2012 2011 and 2010 net revenues from these countries was approximately 9 of total net revenues in each of the years and average days that accounts receivable were outstanding were 288 318 and 217 days respectively as of december 31 2012 and 

  

december 31 2011 net trade receivables from these countries were approximately 34 and 38 respectively of consolidated accounts receivable net if global economic conditions deteriorate we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our customers’ purchases from us also we may incur higher credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2013 and beyond 

we completed four latestage technology acquisitions and expanded our presence in the anesthesia market through the acquisition of all of the assets of lma international nv during 2012 the aggregate fair value of the consideration paid was approximately 4222 million which includes initial consideration of approximately 3679 million contingent consideration arrangements related to the businesses acquired which were valued at 558 million and a 15 million favorable working capital adjustment related to the lma acquisition as of december 31 2012 the aggregate amount of actual contingent consideration could be up to 74 million we allocated the fair value of the 4222 million consideration paid to assets acquired of 4763 million net of liabilities assumed of 541 million the assets acquired included intangibles for technology inprocess research and development customer lists tradenames and goodwill aggregating approximately 3915 million see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis at december 31 2012 of our 3370 million of cash and cash equivalents 2640 million was held at foreign subsidiaries we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and subject to cash payment of additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes these funds could be repatriated if necessary any additional taxes could be offset at least in part by foreign tax credits the amount of any cash taxes which could be significant and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense as taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested 

we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of our debt service requirements substantially all of which relate to united states indebtedness because the net cash provided by usbased operating activities alone is not sufficient accordingly we repatriated approximately 56 million and 70 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements these cash distributions are subject to tax in the us at the corporate tax rate reduced by applicable foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid on distributed earnings approximately 461 million of our 1939 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was generated in the us and approximately 98 million of our 944 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was generated in the us 

we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until 2014 we anticipate our domestic interest payments for 2013 will be approximately 604 million to the extent we cannot or choose not to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements our revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner 

during 2011 we received 96 million of zerocoupon greek government bonds the “greek bonds” in settlement of trade receivables due us from sales to the public hospital system in greece for 2007 2008 and 2009 at december 31 2010 we had an allowance of 22 million on receivables to be settled by the bonds during 2011 we recorded additional losses of 45 million and received 23 million in proceeds from the sale of approximately 54 million in principal amount of these greek bonds at december 31 2011 we had approximately 09 million of the greek bonds remaining on our balance sheet which were sold in january of 2012 the 09 million fair value of the bonds at december 31 2011 reflected the final value received from the january 2012 sale of the remaining 

  

bonds for additional information regarding the fair value of the greek bonds see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

during 2011 we completed a series of transactions that significantly restructured our debt obligations and borrowing capacity 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

cash flows 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 

 

 comparison of 2012 and 2011 

cash flow from operating activities 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately 1939 million during 2012 compared to 944 million during 2011 the 995 million increase is primarily due to favorable yearoveryear changes in working capital items primarily accounts receivable favorable yearoveryear by 406 million inventory favorable yearoveryear by 318 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets favorable yearoveryear by 181 million the yearoveryear improvement in working capital from accounts receivable reflects a significant collection of receivables from the spanish government approximately 175 million during the second quarter of 2012 largely offset by higher net revenues in 2012 in the americas and emea the comparatively unfavorable change in accounts receivable in 2011 reflected the effect of the termination of a factoring agreement in italy approximately 304 million and a slowdown in collections particularly in italy spain and greece approximately 181 million the yearoveryear improvement in working capital related to inventories reflects a 2012 reduction in the buildup of inventory in 2011 and inventory writeoffs of excess slow moving and damaged product in asia in 2012 the 2011 increase in inventory reflected a planned worldwide buildup of inventory primarily to improve service levels by accelerating fulfillment of customer orders the inventory increases in 2011 also included a 71 million increase in the asia pacific region to stock a new distribution facility in singapore the yearoveryear improvement in working capital from prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily reflects the collection of outstanding 2011 vat claims in 2012 these favorable yearoveryear comparisons were partly offset by a reduction in deferred tax liability associated with potential future repatriation of nonpermanently reinvested foreign earnings in 2012 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was 3859 million during 2012 reflecting payments for businesses acquired of 3870 million principally lma and capital expenditures of 654 million partly offset by the proceeds from sales of businesses and assets of 667 million the payments for businesses acquired includes the aggregate initial consideration we paid in connection with the acquisitions and approximately 177 million for contingent consideration payments related to our acquisitions of vasonova inc “vasonova” acquired in 2011 semprus biosciences axiom technology partners llc and the ez blocker product line acquired in 2012 the proceeds from sales of businesses and assets include 451 million from the sale of the orthopedic business 168 million that we received as a working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of the agreement related to the sale of the cargo systems and container businesses of our former aerospace segment 45 million from the payment of a subordinated promissory note related to the sale of the marine business of our former commercial segment and proceeds of 03 million from the sale of a building 

  

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was 473 million in 2012 primarily due to dividend payments of 556 million partly offset by 90 million in proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options issued under our stock compensation plans compared to net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations of 52 million in 2011 

comparison of 2011 and 2010 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled 944 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 compared to 1438 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 the decrease primarily reflects the fact that we received a significant tax refund of 595 million in 2010 which favorably affected cash flow in the 2010 period in addition the 2011 decrease reflects a 338 million increase in worldwide inventory levels which was 124 million greater than the 214 million increase in inventory during the 2010 period we increased our inventory levels in 2011 principally to improve our service levels by accelerating fulfillment of customer orders the inventory increase also included a 71 million increase in the asia pacific region to stock a new distribution facility in singapore these operating cash flow decreases as compared to the prior period were somewhat offset by a modestly smaller increase in accounts receivable during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 as compared to the prior year period the accounts receivable increase in the 2011 period was 436 million 65 million less than the increase during the same period in 2010 however 397 million of the increase in 2010 resulted from a change in accounting guidance that caused trade receivables under our asset securitization program to be included as accounts receivable on our balance sheet prior to the change in accounting guidance the trade receivables were treated as sold and were not included in our balance sheet the increase in accounts receivable during the twelve months of 2011 reflects higher accounts receivable in europe of 499 million primarily due to the termination of a factoring agreement in italy approximately 304 million and a slowdown in payments particularly in italy and spain approximately 181 million 

during 2011 we recognized additional litigation reserves of 171 million associated with retained liabilities related to businesses that have been divested of the 171 million recorded 75 million was associated with recall costs related to defective products which was a subject of pending litigation related to our former commercial segment during the third quarter of 2011 we settled the litigation as it related to the recall costs and as part of the settlement paid 76 million in september 2011 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations totaled 3007 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 compared to 1521 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations during 2011 includes 3721 million in proceeds net of cash and closing costs associated with the sale of the marine and aerospace businesses plus 39 million related to the sale of a building that was previously held for sale partly offset by cash paid of 306 million for the acquisition of vasonova and capital expenditures of 446 million the 306 million paid for the acquisition of vasonova includes the initial payment of 249 million plus a 60 million contingent payment made to the former vasonova security holders upon receiving 510k clearance from the us food and drug administration less a hold back fee and cash in the business obtained in the acquisition 

cash flow from financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations totaled 52 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 which included proceeds from additional borrowings of 5150 million including the issuance of our 2019 notes this additional indebtedness was partially 

  

offset by repayments of outstanding debt totaling 4558 million including the prepayment of the 2004 notes totaling 1658 million and the repayment of 1250 million under our senior credit facility we incurred costs of 185 million associated with the repayments of these amounts including the related make whole amounts paid to the holders of the 2004 notes and related fees and our additional borrowings we also paid 250 million against our securitization program made dividend payments of 551 million and recognized proceeds of 340 million from the exercise of outstanding stock options issued under our stock compensation plans 

financing arrangements 

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

 

 the increase in percentage of net debt to total capital in 2012 compared to 2011 was largely due to reductions in cash and cash equivalents and shareholders’ equity the decrease in cash was primarily a result of the purchase of lma in october of 2012 the decrease in shareholders’ equity was primarily a result of the 332 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2012 

fixed rate borrowings comprised 63 of total borrowings at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 

our senior credit agreement and the indenture under which we issued our 2019 notes contain covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 401 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than 3501 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement at december 31 2012 our consolidated leverage ratio was 2881 and our interest coverage ratio was 5371 both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence 

at december 31 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding and approximately 24 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 4000 million revolving credit facility this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in our senior credit agreement moreover additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur notwithstanding these restrictions we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs at our current level of ebitda as defined in 

  

the senior credit agreement for the year ended december 31 2012 we would have been permitted 3973 million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31 2012 moreover additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 

as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all other terms of our senior credit agreement and our 2019 notes and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements including the leverage and interest coverage ratios under our senior credit agreement throughout 2013 

in addition we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 500 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2012 the maximum amount available for borrowing was 440 million this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had 47 million of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

our 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the “convertible notes” are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method we must calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period at the time we sold our convertible notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the notes by in effect increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes from our economic standpoint to 7465 however under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is antidilutive we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 

under the treasury stock method changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation the following table provides examples of how changes in our stock price would impact the number of additional shares included in the denominator of the fully diluted earnings per share calculation “total treasury stock method incremental shares” the table also reflects the impact on the number of shares we could expect to issue upon concurrent settlement of the convertible notes the warrant and the convertible note hedge “incremental shares issued by teleflex upon conversion” 

 

  

    

our 3875 convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances including the attainment of 130 of the conversion price approximately 7972 of the company’s closing stock price during a certain number of days at the end of a fiscal quarter the company’s closing stock price has recently approached this amount which increases the possibility that the convertible notes could become convertible in the near future at which point the convertible notes would be classified as a current liability the company has elected a net settlement method to satisfy its conversion obligation under which the company may settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares the company believes that it has the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand accessing our credit facility or raising money in the capital markets 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

stock repurchase programs 

on june 14 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of our outstanding common stock repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generated from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition our senior credit facility and our 2019 notes limit our ability to repurchase shares and make other restricted payments accordingly these provisions may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization through december 31 2012 no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations at december 31 2012 are as follows 

 

  

  

 we recently announced that we will be relocating our corporate headquarters in the first half of 2014 in connection with the relocation in december 2012 we entered into a lease for approximately 84000 square feet of office space in wayne pennsylvania the lease has an initial lease term of 10 years and 8 months with an option to renew for an additional ten years aggregate rental payments during the initial term of the lease are expected to be approximately 30 million 

  

we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 683 million and 617 million as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 

in 2012 cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were 176 million and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be approximately 71 million in 2013 due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2013 

see notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts 

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable considering the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 

in light of the disruptions in global economic markets we instituted enhanced measures to facilitate customerbycustomer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts such measures included among others monthly credit control committee meetings at which customer credit risks are identified after review of among other things accounts that exceed specified credit limits payment delinquencies and other customer problems in addition for some of our nongovernment customers we instituted measures designed to reduce our risk exposures including issuing dunning letters reducing credit limits requiring that payments accompany orders and instituting legal action with respect to delinquent accounts with respect to government customers we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices 

some of our customers particularly in europe have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these 

  

customers for the most part in greece italy spain and portugal is the primary cause for the increase in the allowance at december 31 2012 these countries accounted for 34 of our consolidated accounts receivable net if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries continue to deteriorate such that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain additional allowances may be required in future periods our allowance for doubtful accounts was 78 million at december 31 2012 and 65 million at december 31 2011 which was 24 and 22 respectively of gross accounts receivable 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our operating results moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

distributor rebates 

we offer rebates to certain distributors and reserve an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale the estimate is based on an historical experience rate of rebate claims by distributors over the previous 12 months for specific product lines the reserve for estimated rebates was 195 million and 96 million at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively the increase in rebates in 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to the acquisition of lma 

inventory utilization 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market accordingly we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 

our inventory reserve was 317 million at december 31 2012 and 329 million at december 31 2011 which equaled 89 and 99 of gross inventories respectively 

accounting for longlived assets and investments 

the ability to realize longlived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount the evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

  

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets at december 31 2012 were as follows 

 

 intangible assets may represent indefinitelived assets eg certain trademarks or brands determinablelived intangibles eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies or goodwill of these only the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles assets primarily trademarks and brand names are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

goodwill 

goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level our reporting units are generally businesses one level below the respective operating segment in applying the goodwill impairment test we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors may include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry conditions the competitive environment changes in the market for our products and services regulatory and political developments entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance if after completing such assessment it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we proceed to a twostep quantitative impairment test alternatively we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the twostep impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis in the fourth quarter of 2012 we performed a qualitative assessment on six of our reporting units that carry goodwill and determined based on the qualitative assessment that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not higher than its carrying value for the two remaining reporting units that carry goodwill the vascular and anesthesiarespiratory reporting units we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and test them through the twostep quantitative impairment test as discussed below 

the first step of the twostep impairment test is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its carrying value in performing the first step we calculate fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows “dcf” of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the 

  

market approach if the fair value exceeded the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeded the fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of our reporting units were 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs 4 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2012 as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter 2012 impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit the discount rate was 100 for all reporting units a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units 

in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit we considered the results of both the income and the market approach and determined the fair value of each reporting unit based on the average of the results yielded by the two methods in addition our current market capitalization was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units plus a control premium to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately 30 which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 

no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above in the fourth quarter 2012 impairment test in 2012 the fair value of our vascular and anesthesiarespiratory reporting units exceed its respective carrying value by more than 20 

our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year that collectively more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle under the income approach significant changes in assumptions would be required for these reporting units to fail the step one test for example an increase of over 15 in the discount rate or a decrease of over 10 percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required to indicate impairment for these reporting units nevertheless while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable and achievable the possibility remains that the constant currency revenue growth of this reporting unit may not perform as expected and as a result the estimated fair value may decline if our strategy andor new products are not successful and we do not achieve core revenue growth in the future the goodwill in the vascular and anesthesiarespiratory reporting units may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges 

in the first quarter of 2012 we changed our north america reporting unit structure from a single reporting unit to five reporting units comprised of vascular anesthesiarespiratory cardiac surgical and specialty we allocated the assets and liabilities of our north america segment among the new reporting units based on their respective operating activities and then allocated goodwill among the reporting units using a relative fair value approach as required by fasb accounting standards codification “asc” topic 350 

  

following this allocation we performed goodwill impairment tests on these new reporting units in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of these tests we determined that three of the reporting units in our north america segment were impaired and we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 220 million in our vascular reporting unit 107 million in our anesthesiarespiratory reporting unit and 5 million in our cardiac reporting unit in the first quarter of 2012 

intangible assets 

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology customer relationships and trade names the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method the excess earnings method measures economic benefit of an asset indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to the asset after appropriate returns are paid with respect to complementary or contributory assets the residual profit is taxeffected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired similar to the goodwill impairment test process we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value if after completing such qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount the asset is not impaired if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets is less than the carrying value we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amounts alternatively we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinitelived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2012 we performed a qualitative assessment on all of our indefinitelived assets except for our taut tradename and determined based on the qualitative assessment that their fair value was more likely than not higher than its carrying value for the taut tradename we elected to test it through the quantitative impairment test as discussed below 

in connection with the quantitative impairment test management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology described above under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the indefinitelived asset during the fourth quarter of 2012 is comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from the trade name was 4 and a royalty rate of 4 was assumed discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 

  

no impairment in the carrying value of our indefinitelived intangible asset was evident as a result of the assessment of its respective fair value as determined under the methodology described above 

we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets eg customer relationships instead longlived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and reassessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finitelived assets by among other things assessing customer attrition rates 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows 

 

 significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

 

 product warranty liability 

we warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products that we will at our option repair or replace without charge such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect warranty periods vary by product we have recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty we accrue for product warranties when based on available information it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold and a reasonable estimate of the costs based on historical claims experience relative to sales can be made our estimated product warranty liability was 05 million and 79 million at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively the decrease in the reserve is due to a settlement in 2012 of a retained liability related to a divested business 

  

sharebased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 

accounting for income taxes 

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 705 million and 663 million at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under asc topic 740 “income taxes” which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal 

  

state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known specifically we are currently in the midst of examinations by the us canadian czech republic and austrian taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates shown below are the weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on interest rates in effect on december 31 2012 

 

 a change of 10 in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately 24 million for the year ended december 31 2013 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures these are primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar or the euro the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december 31 2012 was a net loss of 04 million the following table provides information regarding our open forward currency contracts as of december 31 2012 which mature in 2013 forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately 669 million 

  

forward currency contracts 

 

 a strengthening of 10 in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would on a combined basis adversely impact the translation of our nonus subsidiary net earnings and transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries by approximately 121 million for the year ended december 31 2013

our regional anesthesia or acute pain management products include epidural catheters and trays spinal needles and trays and peripheral nerve block needles catheters and trays peripheral nerve block products provide pain relief during and after orthopedic surgical procedures and help clinicians better manage each patient’s pain we offer the first stimulating continuous nerve block catheter the arrow stimucath which confirms the positive placement of the catheter next to the nerve the arrow flex tip plus continuous epidural catheter features a soft flexible tip that helps reduce the incidence of complications such as transient paresthesia a sensation of tingling pricking or numbness of a person’s skin and inadvertent penetration of blood vessels or the dura while improving the clinician’s ability to thread the catheter into the epidural space our arrow theracath epidural catheter with high compression strength for directionability and enhanced radiopacity the ability to stop the passage of xrays was designed for pain management procedures where increased steerability is important additional integral components create a range of standard and custom procedural kits in 2009 we introduced a new line of kits designed for administration of spinal anesthesia marketed under the arrow sureblock spinal anesthesia brand name in 2011 we introduced the arrow stimuquik echo singleshot pnb needles which feature 5 grooved rings at the distal end of the needle to help clinicians identify the tip of the needle under ultrasound also in 2011 we commenced distribution of the stimpod line of nerve stimulators in the united states and canada which provide clinicians with audiovisual feedback to help facilitate needle and catheter placement 

respiratory care 

teleflex’s respiratory products accounted for 18 percent of our critical care product net revenues in 2011 these products are used in a variety of clinical settings including hospitals longterm care facilities rehabilitation centers and patients’ homes to treat respiratory ailments such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd pneumonia cystic fibrosis and asthma we market respiratory products under the hudson rci gibeck voldyne micromist and conchatherm brand names 

our respiratory portfolio includes 

 

  

   

  

 conchatherm neptune a key product within our respiratory portfolio is a heated humidifier that features an adjustable airway temperature and temperature gradient control that allows for customized treatment to improve caregiver efficiency maximize patient outcomes and enhance the quality of care the universal design allows for use in invasive and noninvasive applications including high flow oxygen therapy an emerging technology for the treatment of respiratory disorders 

a new addition to the teleflex respiratory portfolio is the gibeck ® humidflo 72hour integrated kit which includes all of the components necessary to initiate passive humidification and promote best practices to help reduce the risk of vap the gibeck humidflo heat  moisture exchanger hme is validated through our internal testing to remain inline during the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation reducing circuit breaks and enabling adherence to clinical practice guidelines designed to maximize clinical outcomes while reducing costs 

another key product within our respiratory portfolio is the hudson rci softech nasal cannula line which features an exceptionally soft material resulting in greater comfort for patients receiving longterm oxygen therapy this recently expanded product line includes the comfort fit™ cannula with cushions designed to relieve chafing and pressure around a patient’s ears in the critical care environment the comfort fit cannula offering helps hospitals reduce the risk of hospital acquired pressure ulcers hapu a preventable hospital acquired condition hac the treatment of which will no longer be reimbursed by insurance providers 

urology 

our line of urology products which accounted for 16 percent of our critical care product net revenues in 2011 provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and home care markets our product portfolio consists principally of a wide range of catheters including foley intermittent external and suprapubic urine collectors catheterization accessories and products for operative endurology marketed under the rusch brand name 

our urology business in europe and the united states also serves home care markets and patient care outside of the hospital over the past few years we have expanded our offerings for these markets to include a wider range of intermittent catheters catheter insertion kits and accessories used by quadriplegic and paraplegic people many of these products are designed to support patient safety and infection prevention efforts for example we recently introduced an intermittent catheter with hydrophilic coating an ergothan tip protective sleeve and saline solution in our emea region 

home care markets are subject to local and regional reimbursement regulations that can impact volumes and pricing for example in the united states reimbursement regulations were implemented in 2008 that permit reimbursement for up to 200 catheters per month replacing the previous limit of four catheters per month the change promoted a shift from reuseable catheters with their inherent risk of infections to singleuse intermittent catheters sales of our intermittent catheters in the united states have benefited from this change in reimbursement policy 

surgical care 

surgical care which is predominantly comprised of singleuse products represented 18 percent of net revenues in 2011 our surgical products include ligation and closure products including appliers clips and sutures used in a variety of surgical procedures access ports used in minimally invasive surgical procedures including robotic surgery and fluid management products used for chest drainage our surgical products also include handheld instruments for general and specialty surgical procedures we market surgical products under the deknatel pleurevac pilling taut and weck brand names 

  

hemolok a significant part of the weck portfolio is a unique locking polymer ligation clip that combines the security of a suture with the speed of a metal clip for open and laparoscopic surgery hemolok clips have special applications in robotic laparoscopic and cardiovascular surgery 

recently introduced products include deklene maxx a line of high performing polypropelene sutures utilized extensively in cardiovascular surgery continued upgrades to the taut laparoscopic access ports to incorporate a universal seal design and improvements to the chest drainage line to expand capabilities to a broader range of facilities with lowflow technology 

cardiac care 

cardiac care products accounted for approximately 5 percent of net revenues in 2011 products in this category include diagnostic catheters and capital equipment our diagnostic catheters include thermodilution and wedge pressure catheters specialized angiographic catheters such as berman and reverse berman catheters therapeutic delivery catheters such as temporary pacing catheters sheaths for femoral and transradial aortic access used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and intraaortic balloon or iab catheters capital equipment includes our intraaortic balloon pump or iabp consoles iabp products are used to augment oxygen delivery to the cardiac muscle and reduce the oxygen demand after cardiac surgery serious heart attack or interventional procedures 

the iab and iabp product lines feature the autocat 2 wave console and the fiberoptix catheter which together utilize fiber optic technology for arterial pressure signal acquisition and enable the patented wave timing algorithm to support the broadest range of patient heart rhythms including severely arrhythmic patients 

oem and development services 

customized extrusion performance fibers and devices sold to original equipment manufacturers or oems represented 11 percent of our net revenues in 2011 teleflex medical oem designs and delivers products that touch nearly every organ and system in the human body we are known for our expertise and comprehensive product development and outsourcing services which include design engineering regulatory affairs prototyping manufacturing assembly and packaging 

our oem products which are marketed under the beere medical kmedic smd deknatel and tfx oem brand names encompass customconfigured extrusion introducer systems specialty sutures resins yarns surgical instruments for orthopedic and spinal procedures and micromachined fixation devices and components 

history and recent developments 

teleflex was founded in 1943 as a manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft from this original single market single product orientation we have grown through an active program of development of new products introduction of products into new geographic or endmarkets and through acquisitions of companies with related market technology or industry expertise throughout our history we have continually focused on providing innovative technologydriven specialtyengineered products that help our customers meet their business requirements 

over the past several years we have significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace and commercial markets the most significant of these transactions occurred in 2007 with our acquisition of arrow international a leading global supplier of catheterbased medical technology products used for vascular access and cardiac care and the divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses our acquisition of arrow significantly expanded our singleuse product offerings for critical care enhanced our global footprint and added to our research and development capabilities with the divestitures of our marine business and cargo container and systems businesses in 2011 we have become exclusively a medical device company 

  

we expect to continue to increase the relative composition of our business through a combination of portfolio management and organic growth initiatives from time to time we explore and engage in discussions regarding acquisitions that would augment our existing technology platform 

government regulation 

government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products and the products sold by our customers that incorporate our products the us food and drug administration and government agencies in other countries regulate the approval manufacturing sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products for more information see item 1a “risk factors” 

competition 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us with access to significant financial resources furthermore extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness our competitors include c r bard inc covidien and carefusion 

sales and marketing 

our products are sold directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces and through independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

backlog 

most of our products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore our backlog of orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any future 12month period 

patents and trademarks 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

suppliers and materials 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we may not be able to successfully pass these cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

  

research and development 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development our research and development costs principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and our efforts to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

seasonality 

portions of our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to singleuse products 

employees 

we employed approximately 11500 fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2011 of these employees approximately 3300 were employed in the united states and 8200 in countries outside of the united states less than 5 percent of our employees in the united states were covered by union contracts we also have collectivebargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover employees in other countries we believe we have good relationships with our employees

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks include but are not limited to the following 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business 

the medical device industry is highly competitive we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us with access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources and that participate in numerous markets 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and enhance existing products our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments there can 

  

be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as our inability to 

 

  

  

  

 in addition our competitors currently may be developing or may develop in the future products that are more effective than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could reduce our revenues and margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursement and the failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursements for our products is important to our business demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the level of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products could be adversely affected 

we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by altering the extent to which potential customers select our products and the prices they are willing to pay in addition as a result of their purchasing power and continually rising healthcare costs third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our existing products and potential new products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims that may be brought against us and recalls which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore as a medical device company we face an inherent risk of damage to our reputation if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients in addition many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time product defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in injury to or death of the patient product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or 

  

indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of the potential losses relating to product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the cost to defend against any such litigation may be significant we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by regulatory authorities to participate in a recall of that product in the event of a recall we may experience lost sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims moreover our reputation could be damaged if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern the development design approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products moreover these regulations are subject to future change failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to manufacturing shutdowns product shortages delays in product manufacturing product seizures recalls operating restrictions withdrawal or suspension of required licenses and prohibitions against exporting of products to or importing products from countries outside the united states we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we must first receive either 510k clearance or approval of a premarket approval or pma application from the fda unless an exemption applies in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that our proposed product is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the pma pathway requires us to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based in part on data obtained in human clinical trials similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda is currently reviewing its 510k clearance process and may make the process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future 510k product clearance the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues in substantial additional costs or in limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance by the fda can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or integrity issues relating to the marketing application later discovery of violations of fda requirements for medical devices could result in fda enforcement actions including warning letters fines delays or 

  

suspensions of regulatory clearances product seizures or recalls injunctions advisories or other field actions andor operating restrictions medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses promoting a device for an offlabel use could result in government enforcement action 

furthermore our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign governmental authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the quality system regulation which requires testing complaint handling periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures the fda may also inspect for compliance with medical device reporting regulation which requires manufacturers to submit reports to fda of certain adverse events or malfunctions and whether the facilities have submitted notifications of product recalls or other corrective actions in accordance with fda regulations issues identified during such periodic inspections may result in warning letters manufacturing shutdowns product shortages product seizures or recalls fines and delays in product manufacturing and may require significant resources to resolve 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring realignment cost reduction and other strategic initiatives 

over the past few years we have implemented several restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including the realignment of our north american organizational structure facility consolidations and reductions in our workforce while we have started to realize the efficiencies of these actions we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of these initiatives further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated we may also experience unanticipated difficulties or delays in implementing these measures which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions in addition if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in significant additional charges moreover if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies we plan to commence efforts in 2012 to begin transitioning our businesses to a single enterprise resource planning or erp system in the event we encounter any problems with this transition we could experience business disruptions which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of the erp system could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our strategic initiatives may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income 

our strategies include making significant investments to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future 

  

acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to attract retain train and develop key employees is important to our success 

our success depends in part on our ability to continue to retain our key personnel including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team our success also depends in part on our ability to attract retain train and develop other key employees including research and development sales marketing and operations personnel achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to attract retain train and develop such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis we may experience difficulty in implementing our business strategy which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

an interruption in our manufacturing operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

many of our key products are manufactured at single locations and the availability of alternate facilities is limited if an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of our facilities we may not be able to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers we may not be able to timely manufacture the affected products at previous levels or at all furthermore in the event of a disruption in our supply of certain components or materials the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products could delay or otherwise impair our ability to establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials on a timely basis a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets including the european sovereign debt crisis combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions including the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets in recent years in particular the european sovereign debt crisis and its collateral effects on global financial markets may have a negative impact on our business the credit and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years leading to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending these recessionary conditions have caused customers to reduce delay or cancel purchases of our products and services while recent economic indicators suggest improvement in the united states and global economy we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more normalized spending behaviors if the recessionary conditions return our customers may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us in the future 

  

adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us such as shortening the required payment period for our accounts payable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us these types of actions could significantly affect our liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

additionally our customers particularly in the european region have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided which may lead to collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our operating results moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

in addition the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet have increased significantly in recent years primarily as a result of the acquisition of arrow international in 2007 adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

 

  

  

  

 if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

  

further the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “healthcare reform act” imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers effective march 30 2013 such information will be made publicly available in a searchable format beginning september 30 2013 in addition device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to healthcare providers some states such as california massachusetts and vermont mandate implementation of compliance programs that include the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation for consulting and other services and other remuneration to healthcare providers the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements and may result in increased compliance costs which could adversely impact our results of operations 

health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business 

political economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare reform act enacted in march 2010 substantially changes the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers encourages improvements in the quality of health care items and services and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the healthcare reform act 

 

  

  

  

 we currently estimate the impact of the 23 deductible excise tax to be approximately 150 million annually beginning in 2013 however we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the healthcare reform act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

research and development for some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development and use of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge and advice our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations outside the united states in a number of countries including canada belgium the czech republic france germany ireland malaysia mexico and singapore as of december 31 2011 approximately 37 of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states in addition in 2011 approximately 48 of our net revenues based on business unit location were derived from operations outside the united states approximately 71 of our fulltime and temporary employees as of december 31 2011 were employed in countries outside of the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures these measures may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also could suffer severe penalties including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls personnel changes and other remedial actions 

  

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as the laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure that a violation will not occur whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial penalties including fines and enforcement actions and civil and criminal sanctions the disgorgement of profits and the imposition of a courtappointed monitor as well as the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in us government contracts 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenue from products manufactured in and sold into nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our us dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currency in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers and thus adversely affect their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect our results 

as a company with significant operations outside of the united states we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions as a result our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our effective tax rate may however be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in addition unfavorable results of tax audits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

  

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous us and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications we cannot assure you that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states there is no guarantee that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information or copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be required to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages and to cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing could be detrimental to our business 

other pending and future litigation may lead us to incur significant costs and have an adverse effect on our business 

we also are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving among other things contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 

  

   

 these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover we may become subject to additional environmental claims which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our past present or future business activities which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired which would adversely affect our consolidated results and our ability to operate our business and our stock price 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 

any failure on our part to remedy any identified control deficiencies or any delays or errors in our financial reporting would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 approximately 4 of our net revenues were generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

as of december 31 2011 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 9598 million 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to 

 

  

  

  

 we may not be able to affect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations 

the credit agreement governing our credit facilities and the indenture governing our 6875 senior subordinated notes contain covenants that among other things impose significant restrictions on our business the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations on our and their ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the credit agreement governing our credit facilities also contains financial covenants a breach of any covenants under any one or more of these debt agreements could result in a default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all our debts in addition any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings compliance with debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

  

the contingent conversion features of our convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2010 we issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 which we refer to as the “convertible notes” the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock beginning on may 1 2017 or earlier upon the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the convertible note terms see “convertible notes” under note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the convertible notes if the convertible notes become eligible for conversion and one or more holders elect to convert their notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than cash in lieu of any fractional shares we would be required to settle a portion of or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity in addition even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes if the method of settlement effective during the period reflected in the financial statements is cash settlement or combination settlement we would be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than longterm liability in such financial statements which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 

the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may affect the value of our common stock 

in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with third parties which we refer to as the hedge counterparties the hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the convertible notes and are expected to reduce our exposure to potential dilution with respect to our common stock andor reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that may be required to be made by us upon conversion of the convertible notes separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock with the hedge counterparties with a strike price of 74648 subject to customary antidilution adjustments pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue shares of our common stock the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or if we so elect obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants 

in connection with establishing its initial hedges of the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates entered into various cashsettled overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the convertible notes the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates may in their sole discretion with or without notice modify their hedge positions from time to time and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to the conversion of the convertible notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution and we will be subject to the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of each hedge counterparty will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or 

  

financial difficulties of many financial institutions including a bankruptcy filing by lehman brothers holdings inc and its various affiliates if a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock market price and in volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by a hedge counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes which could lower the price of our common stock 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2011 we had outstanding approximately 407 million shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 11 million shares of our common stock of which approximately 06 million were vested as of that date approximately 03 million of restricted stock awards which are expected to vest over the next three years and approximately 23000 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan in addition a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options upon conversion of the convertible notes and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock issuable upon any conversion of the convertible notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the anticipated issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents and delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our convertible notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us 

certain provisions in the convertible notes and the indenture governing the convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if an 

  

acquisition event constitutes a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in addition if an acquisition event constitutes a “makewhole fundamental change” as defined in the indenture we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such acquisition event in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs to achieve this mission we are committed to the following investing in technology and developing our pipeline leveraging and building our core franchises and distribution channels attracting developing and retaining talented employees around the world and continuing to build financial strength by expanding our margins and maintaining strong cash flow all in an effort to successfully grow our reputation as a solid investment and a profitable strong employer we primarily design develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers in more than 130 countries through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors our products are used in a wide variety of markets and are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure 

we provide a broadbased platform of products which we categorize into four product groups critical care surgical care cardiac care and oem and development services 

over the past several years we have focused on transitioning to a pureplay medical technology company through an extensive acquisition and divestiture program and focused our resources on the development of our healthcare business we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical technology industry while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace and commercial markets the most significant of these transactions occurred in 2007 with our acquisition of arrow international a leading global supplier of catheterbased medical technology products used for vascular access and critical care and the divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses 

below is a listing of our more significant acquisitions and divestitures that have occurred since 2009 with respect to divested businesses listed below we have reported results of operations cash flows and gains losses on the disposition of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our significant divestitures

 health care reform 

on march 23 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law while providing some clarity on the impact of reform to our industry this legislation will have a significant impact on our business for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare which could negatively affect pricing of our products in addition commencing in 2013 the legislation imposes a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices as this new law is implemented we will be in a better position to ascertain its impact on our business we currently estimate the impact of the medical device excise tax will be approximately 15 million annually beginning in 2013 also in the first quarter of 2010 we evaluated the change in the tax regulations related to the medicare part d subsidy as currently outlined in the new legislation and determined that it did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

global economic conditions 

global economic conditions since 2008 have had adverse impacts on market activities including among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity and reduced demand for products and services in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in the first half of 2009 although on a consolidated basis the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity over the last three years the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit and public sector austerity measures in response to growing public budget deficits could adversely affect our operations in the future as described below the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources” in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we serve a diverse base of hospitals and healthcare providers in more than 130 countries healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last three years 

  

hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels during 2009 and generally have not replenished inventories to prerecession levels the impact of these actions is most pronounced in capital goods markets which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses our orthopedic oem business was impacted in 2009 by delayed new product launches by our oem customers more recently this situation has improved somewhat but has not returned to prerecession levels approximately 90 percent of our net revenues come from singleuse products used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers 

in europe some countries have taken austerity measures due to the current economic climate elective surgeries have been delayed and hospital budgets have been reduced in certain countries mainly germany we have seen changes in the local reimbursement to home care patients and pricing impacts on business awarded through the tendering process these markets have introduced more buying groups and group purchasing organizations or gpos resulting in reductions in commodity product pricing it is possible that funding for publically funded healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs during 2010 and continuing into 2011 the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which has resulted in a slow down in payments to us we believe this situation will continue and may worsen unless and until these countries are able to find alternative means of funding their respective public healthcare sectors in 2011 net revenues in these countries accounted for approximately 9 of our consolidated net revenues and 38 of our consolidated account receivable net 

in asia recovery from the global recession has varied by country china has announced plans for major healthcare investment targeted at second tier citieshospitals which may provide future growth opportunities for us while slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan is expected to limit growth in that market

discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered constant currency revenue growth constant currency revenue growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period and the comparable activity of businesses divested within the most recent twelvemonth period 

  

net revenues for 2011 2010 and 2009 by product group are comprised of the following 

 

 the percentage increases or decreases in net revenues during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 compared to the respective prior years were due to the following factors 

 

  

 

 comparison of 2011 and 2010 

critical care 

the critical care product group net revenues increased approximately 64 in 2011 to 10041 million from 9434 million in 2010 the increase in 2011 was attributable to constant currency revenue growth of 40 and favorable foreign currency movements of 24 the constant currency growth was primarily due to higher sales of vascular access and anesthesia products in north america europe and asialatin america respiratory products in north america europe and asia and urology products in europe and latin america 

surgical care 

the surgical care product group net revenues increased 56 in 2011 to 2774 million compared to 2627 million in 2010 during 2011 the surgical care product group experienced constant currency revenue growth of 29 and foreign currency provided the other increase of 27 constant currency revenue growth was principally led by higher sales of ligation products in each of our regions 

cardiac care 

the cardiac care product group net revenues increased approximately 133 in 2011 to 800 million from 706 million in 2010 constant currency revenue growth of 97 and foreign currency movements of 36 contributed to the increase in net revenues between the two periods the increase in constant currency revenue compared with the same period of 2010 was largely attributable to higher sales of intraaortic balloon pump catheters in each of our regions 

  

original equipment manufacturers “oem” and development services 

the oem product group net revenues increased approximately 78 in 2011 to 1663 million from 1542 million in 2010 constant currency growth of 70 accounted for nearly all of the increase in 2011 the growth was a result of higher sales of specialty suture catheter fabrication and orthopedic implant products 

comparison of 2010 and 2009 

critical care 

critical care product group net revenues of approximately 9434 million in 2010 were negatively impacted by approximately 17 million when compared to 2009 due to the recall of our custom iv tubing product during the first quarter of 2010 which contributed to a decline in vascular access sales this decline was offset by higher sales of other vascular access and urology products in north america and europe anesthesia products in europe north america and asialatin america and respiratory products in north america and asialatin america compared with the prior year 

surgical care 

surgical care product group net revenues increased approximately 08 in 2010 to 2627 million from 2607 million in 2009 constant currency growth was 11 in 2010 which was primarily due to higher ligation sales in asialatin america and europe partially offset by lower sales of general instrument and closure devices in north america 

cardiac care 

cardiac care product group net revenues were essentially unchanged between 2010 and 2009 sales of cardiac care products in 2010 compared to 2009 were affected positively by higher sales of intraaortic balloon pumps and catheters primarily in european markets offset by an approximate 3 million impact from the recall of certain intraaortic balloon catheters during the fourth quarter of 2010 

original equipment manufacturers “oem” and development services 

sales of devices to oems increased approximately 44 million in 2010 compared to 2009 constant currency growth to oems was 36 in 2010 compared with 2009 this increase is largely attributable to higher sales of specialty suture and catheter fabrication products partially offset by lower sales of orthopedic implant products and forged instruments due to customer inventory rebalancing and a reduction in new product launches by oem customers 

gross profit 

 

 gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 470 in 2011 from 48 in 2010 the decrease was primarily related to higher manufacturing raw material and fuelrelated freight costs and a 20 million pretax charge to cost of goods sold attributed to a stock keeping unit “sku” rationalization implemented at the end of 2011 to eliminate skus based on low sales volume or insufficient margins to help improve future profitability our ability to increase prices to offset the impact of higher commodity costs has been mixed as price increases in asia latin america and north america were offset by price erosion in europe during 2011 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 480 in 2010 from 478 in 2009 the increase was principally due to sales volume growth related to higher margin products particularly in europe 

  

selling general and administrative 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 281 in 2011 compared to 286 in 2010 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2011 as compared with 2010 was primarily attributable to increased spending related to sales marketing and clinical education initiatives of 185 million and a 45 million loss pertaining to our zerocoupon greek government bonds for additional information on the greek government bonds see note 10 “fair value measurement” to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k in addition increases in litigation reserves during 2011 increased selling general and administrative expenses by approximately 17 million the above increases were partially offset by the fact that the 2010 period included approximately 100 million of costs associated with product recall and remediation activities 

selling general and administrative expenses for 2011 also include approximately 2 million of net separation costs for our former chief executive officer comprised of 5 million of payments under his employment agreement less approximately 3 million of stock option and restricted share forfeitures 

the overall increase in selling general and administrative expenses for 2011 also included 49 million of costs related to vasonova a company we acquired in january 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 286 in 2010 compared to 271 in 2009 the 22 million increase in costs was principally related to higher costs due to investments in sales marketing and clinical education programs of approximately 16 million approximately 10 million of costs associated with product recall and remediation activities partially offset by approximately 4 million lower spending on remediation of fda regulatory issues professional fees incurred in connection with our debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2010 of approximately 2 million were partially offset by reductions in corporate costs of approximately 3 million 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were 32 in 2011 compared to 30 in 2010 the increase in research and development expenses during 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflect increased investments related to catheter tip positioning technologies 

research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were 30 in 2010 compared to 26 in 2009 higher levels of research and development expenses over the period reflect increased investments related to antimicrobial technologies and the establishment of an innovation center in malaysia 

interest income and expense 

 

 interest expense decreased 95 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a reduction of approximately 156 million in average outstanding debt and lower average interest rates 

  

interest expense decreased 93 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a reduction in average outstanding debt coupled with lower average interest rates in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting the refinancing transaction that occurred in the third quarter of 2010 

loss on extinguishments of debt 

 

 during 2011 we recorded losses on the extinguishment of debt of 154 million as a result of the prepayment in the first quarter of 2011 of the remaining outstanding principal amount of our senior notes issued in 2004 the “2004 notes” and the 125 million repayment in the second quarter of 2011 of term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility in connection with the prepayment of our 2004 notes we recognized debt extinguishment costs of approximately 146 million related to the prepayment “makewhole” amount of 139 million paid to the holders of the 2004 notes and the writeoff of 07 million of unamortized debt issuance costs that we incurred prior to the prepayment of the 2004 notes during the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a 08 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the 125 million repayment of term loan borrowings 

in 2010 we recognized losses on the extinguishment of debt of 466 million as a result of our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 and prepayment of notes in the fourth quarter of 2010 in connection with our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 we prepaid our senior notes issued in 2007 the “2007 notes” and together with the 2004 notes the “senior notes” and recognized debt extinguishment costs of approximately 288 million comprised of a prepayment makewhole fee of 281 million the writeoff of 06 million of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions and related legal fees also in connection with our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 we prepaid 200 million of our senior credit facility and recognized additional losses on the extinguishment of debt of 16 million related to the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions in the fourth quarter of 2010 we prepaid 1658 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2004 notes and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 163 million comprised of a prepayment makewhole fee of 155 million the writeoff of 07 million of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions and related legal fees see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

taxes on income from continuing operations 

 

 the effective tax rate in 2011 was 182 compared to 167 in 2010 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2011 were 270 million compared to 180 million in 2010 the increase in the effective tax rate reflects lower beneficial discrete charges offset by a tax benefit with respect to foreign earnings 

the effective tax rate in 2010 was 167 compared to 226 in 2009 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2010 were 180 million compared to 370 million in 2009 the decrease in the effective income tax rate reflects the impact of beneficial discrete tax charges and a reduction in reserves for uncertain tax positions as audits and settlements were closed and fewer new reserves were established

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we initiated a restructuring program at four facilities to consolidate operations and reduce costs in connection with this program we recorded contract termination costs of approximately 26 million associated with a lease termination as we had vacated 50 of the premises as of december 31 2011 in addition we have recorded approximately 15 million for employee termination benefits for workforce consolidations in 2012 we expect to incur additional contract termination costs of approximately 27 million when we have completely exited the leased facility approximately 11 million for facility closure costs related to the other facilities an additional 03 million for termination benefits and 05 million for other costs in connection with the program all of the employee termination benefits facility closure costs and other costs will be paid in 2012 the payment of the contract termination costs associated with the lease termination will continue until 2015 

in connection with our acquisition of arrow in 2007 we formulated a plan to integrate arrow and our other businesses the integration plan focused on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing sales marketing and distribution functions in north america europe and asia costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of arrow have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow and are not included in our results of operations costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of teleflex are charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations these costs amounted to approximately 05 million during 2011 as of december 31 2011 we expect future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the arrow integration plan if any will be nominal 

during 2011 we recognized net impairment charges of 25 million related to the decline in value of our investments in affiliates that are considered to be other than temporary in making this determination we considered multiple factors including our intent and ability to hold investments operating losses of investees that demonstrate an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments the investee’s liquidity and cash position and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services 

during the third quarter of 2009 based on continued deterioration in the california real estate market we recorded 33 million in impairment charges to fully writeoff an investment in a real estate venture in california we initially invested in the venture in 2004 by contributing property and other assets that had been part of one of our former manufacturing sites

liquidity and capital resources 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to capital markets 

  

we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs however in light of the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets including the european sovereign debt crisis combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets there is a risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity we continue to monitor our credit risk related to countries affected by the sovereign debt issues in europe particularly italy spain portugal and greece as of december 31 2011 our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in these countries were 788 million in 2011 and 2010 net revenues from italy spain portugal and greece was approximately 9 of total net revenues in those respective years as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 net trade receivables from these countries were approximately 38 and 24 respectively of consolidated accounts receivable net if global economic conditions deteriorate we may experience delays in customer payments reductions in our customers’ purchases from us also we may incur higher credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in 2012 and beyond 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis at december 31 2011 of our 5841 million of cash and cash equivalents 4695 million was held at foreign subsidiaries we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and subject to payment of additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes these funds could be repatriated if necessary any additional taxes could be offset at least in part by foreign tax credits the amount of any taxes which could be significant and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws at the time of such repatriation 

we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of our debt service requirements substantially all of which relate to united states indebtedness because the net cash provided by usbased operating activities alone is not sufficient accordingly we repatriated approximately 70 million and 123 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements these cash distributions are subject to tax in the us at the corporate tax rate reduced by applicable foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid on distributed earnings approximately 186 million of our 1031 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was generated in the us and approximately 510 million of our 1516 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was generated in the us 

during 2011 and 2010 we repaid approximately 489 million and 727 million respectively of debt from the proceeds of the issuance of convertible debt and our 6875 senior subordinated notes the sale of businesses and from cash generated from operations as a result we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until 2014 we anticipate our domestic interest payments for 2012 will be approximately 44 million to the extent we cannot or choose not to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements our revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner 

during 2011 we received 96 million of zerocoupon greek government bonds the “greek bonds” in settlement of trade receivables due us from sales to the public hospital system in greece for 2007 2008 and 2009 at december 31 2010 we had an allowance of 22 million on receivables to be settled by the bonds during 2011 we recorded additional losses of 45 million and received 23 million in proceeds from the sale of approximately 54 million in principal amount of these greek bonds at december 31 2011 we had approximately 09 million of the greek bonds remaining on our balance sheet which were sold in january of 2012 the 09 million fair value of the bonds at december 31 2011 reflected the final value received from the january 2012 sale of the remaining bonds for additional information regarding the fair value of the greek bonds see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future 

during 2011 we completed a series of transactions that significantly restructured our debt obligations and borrowing capacity 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

cash flows 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 

 

 comparison of 2011 and 2010 

cash flow from operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled 1031 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 compared to 1516 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 the decrease primarily reflects the fact that we received a significant tax refund of 595 million in 2010 which favorably affected cash flow in the 2010 period in addition the 2011 decrease reflects a 327 million increase in worldwide inventory levels which was 125 million greater than the 202 million increase in inventory during the 2010 period we increased our inventory levels in 2011 principally to improve our service levels by accelerating fulfillment of customer orders the inventory increase also included a 71 million increase in the asia pacific region to stock a new distribution facility in singapore these operating cash flow decreases as compared to the prior period were somewhat offset by a modestly smaller increase in accounts receivable during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 as compared to the prior year period the accounts receivable increase in the 2011 period was 431 million 77 million less than the increase during the same period in 2010 however 397 million of the increase in 2010 resulted from a change in accounting guidance that caused trade receivables under our asset securitization program to be included as accounts receivable on our balance sheet prior to the change in accounting guidance the trade receivables were treated as sold and were not included in our balance sheet the increase in accounts receivable during the twelve months of 2011 reflects higher accounts receivable in europe of 499 million primarily due to the termination of a factoring agreement in italy approximately 304 million and a slowdown in payments particularly in italy and spain approximately 181 million 

during 2011 we recognized additional litigation reserves of 171 million associated with retained liabilities related to businesses that have been divested of the 171 million recorded 75 million was associated with recall costs related to defective products which was a subject of pending litigation related to our former commercial segment during the third quarter of 2011 we settled the litigation as it related to the recall costs and as part of the settlement paid 76 million in september 2011 

cash flow from investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations totaled 3002 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 compared to 1514 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations during 2011 includes 3721 million in proceeds net of cash and closing costs associated with the sale of the marine and aerospace businesses plus 39 million related to the sale of a building that was previously held for sale partly offset by cash paid of 306 million for the acquisition of vasonova and capital expenditures of 451 million the 306 million paid for the acquisition of vasonova includes the initial payment of 249 million plus a 60 million contingent payment made to the former vasonova security holders upon receiving 510k clearance from the us food and drug administration less a hold back fee and cash in the business obtained in the acquisition 

  

cash flow from financing activities   

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations totaled 52 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 which included proceeds from additional borrowings of 5150 million including the issuance of our 2019 notes this additional indebtedness was partially offset by repayments of outstanding debt totaling 4558 million including the prepayment of the 2004 notes totaling 1658 million and the repayment of 1250 million under our senior credit facility we incurred costs of 185 million associated with the repayments of these amounts including the related make whole amounts paid to the holders of the 2004 notes and related fees and our additional borrowings we also paid 250 million against our securitization program made dividend payments of 551 million and recognized proceeds of 340 million from the exercise of outstanding stock options issued under our stock compensation plans 

comparison of 2010 and 2009 

cash flow from operating activities 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately 1516 million during 2010 an increase of 315 million over the comparable period in 2009 cash flow from operations in 2009 was adversely affected by a 975 million tax payment on the sale of the ati businesses while the 2010 increase reflects a tax refund of 595 million and lower payments for interest and restructuring and integration programs the increase was partly offset by a 246 million increase in our contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans in 2010 over the comparable period in 2009 and an increase in receivables of 397 million that resulted from the adoption of an amendment to financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 860 “transfers and servicing” “asc topic 860” in the first quarter of 2010 specifically upon adoption of the amendment the accounts receivable that we previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet under our securitization program are now required to be accounted for as secured borrowings and reflected as shortterm debt on our balance sheet the effect of the amendment is reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows under financing activities in the increase decrease in notes payable and current borrowings and under operating activities in the accounts receivable use of cash underlying these activities cash flow from continuing operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was further reduced by higher receivables primarily in europe reflecting the continued slow down in payments from public hospitals in italy spain portugal and greece where funding continues to be under pressure due to weak economic conditions and higher inventories in north america in advance of the coming flu season 

cash flow from investing activities 

investing activities from continuing operations provided net cash of 1514 million in 2010 primarily due to 247 million in proceeds from the sale of ssi 50 million from the sale of heavy lift and 939 million from the sale of the actuation business partly offset by capital expenditures of 300 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

financing activities from continuing operations used net cash of 3355 million in 2010 during the third quarter of 2010 in connection with the refinancing of a portion of our longterm debt we issued 4000 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes as part of our effort to reduce the potential dilution resulting from the issuance of our common stock andor reduce our exposure to potential cash payments we may be required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes we entered into hedging transactions involving the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information we used approximately 880 million of the convertible note proceeds to purchase the call options which was partially offset by the receipt of 594 million from the sale of the warrants we 

  

used 2000 million of the convertible note proceeds to repay term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility in connection with the refinancing transactions we incurred 214 million of transaction fees and expenses including underwriters’ discounts and commissions we used the remainder of the net proceeds together with available cash to prepay all of our outstanding 2007 notes at an aggregate prepayment purchase price equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of 1966 million plus a prepayment makewhole amount of 281 million during the fourth quarter of 2010 we prepaid 1658 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2004 notes which required the payment to the 2004 noteholders of a prepayment makewhole amount of 155 million we also paid 543 million of dividends these reductions in cash flows from financing activities were partly offset by the 294 million increase in notes payable and current borrowings as a result of the application of the amendment to asc topic 860 discussed above to our securitization program which resulted in the reporting of the securitization program as a secured borrowing in 2010 

financing arrangements 

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

 

 fixed rate borrowings comprised 63 of total borrowings at december 31 2011 versus 53 at december 31 2010 

our senior credit agreement and the indenture under which we issued our 2019 notes contain covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 401 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than 3501 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement at december 31 2011 our consolidated leverage ratio was 2991 and our interest coverage ratio was 4951 both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence 

at december 31 2011 we had no borrowings outstanding and approximately 3 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 400 million revolving credit facility this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs during 2011 we borrowed 165 million under this facility to fund the vasonova acquisition and the retirement of the 2004 notes the borrowings were subsequently repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the marine business and term loan borrowings the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in our senior credit 

  

agreement moreover additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur notwithstanding these restrictions we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december 31 2011 we would have been permitted 326 million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31 2011 moreover additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 

as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all other terms of our senior credit agreement and our 2019 notes and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements including the leverage and interest coverage ratios under our senior credit agreement throughout 2012 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

in addition we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 750 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2011 the maximum amount available for borrowing was 425 million this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had approximately 47 million and 297 million respectively of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

stock repurchase programs 

on june 14 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of our outstanding common stock repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generated from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition our senior credit facility and our 2019 notes limit our ability to repurchase shares and make other restricted payments accordingly these provisions may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization through december 31 2011 no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 

contractual obligations 

contractual obligations at december 31 2011 are as follows 

 

  

   

 we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 617 million and 626 million as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 

in 2011 cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were 65 million and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be approximately 195 million in 2012 due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2012 

see notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

off balance sheet arrangements 

we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for certain equipment the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately 19 million see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts 

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable considering the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services in light of the disruptions in global economic markets that began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and have continued through 2011 we have engaged in a more robust customerbycustomer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts additionally our customers particularly in the european region have extended or delayed payments for products and services 

  

already provided which may lead to collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers specifically in greece italy spain and portugal which is the primary cause for the increase in the allowance our allowance for doubtful accounts was 65 million at december 31 2011 and 41 million at december 31 2010 which was 22 and 13 respectively of gross accounts receivable the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 

although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible we would be required to incur additional charges which could materially adversely affect our operating results moreover our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 

inventory utilization 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market accordingly we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 

our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was 329 million at december 31 2011 and 383 million at december 31 2010 which equaled 99 and 102 of gross inventories respectively the 2011 balance included the additional reserves for the sku rationalization while 2010 included reserves of 79 million related to discontinued operations 

accounting for longlived assets and investments 

the ability to realize longlived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount the evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets at december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

   

intangible assets may represent indefinitelived assets eg certain trademarks or brands determinablelived intangibles eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies or goodwill of these only the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles assets primarily trademarks and brand names are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

goodwill 

impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment our reporting units are generally businesses one level below our single operating segment 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update “asu” that modified the goodwill impairment test process the modification permits companies to assess goodwill impairment on a qualitative basis through the evaluation of various financial business and economic factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the customary twostep process the modification is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we elected to adopt the modification in the fourth quarter of 2011 for our annual impairment testing and determined that four of our six reporting units representing approximately 126 of our total goodwill qualified for the new approach the remainder of our goodwill was evaluated using the customary twostep process for impairment testing the first step of the process is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its carrying value 

consistent with previous years in performing the first step we calculated fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows “dcf” of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value exceeded the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeded the fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of our reporting units were 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the industry in which the reporting units operate 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs 4 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2011 as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter 2011 impairment test was performed 

  

over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit for north america and europe middle east and africa “emea” the two reporting units that were tested under the twostep goodwill impairment test the compound growth rates for revenue were approximately 5 and 4 respectively and approximately 6 for operating income for both reporting units the discount rate was 105 for all reporting units a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units 

in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit we considered the results of both the income and the market approach and concluded the fair value to be the average of the results yielded by the two methods for each reporting unit in addition our current market capitalization was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units plus a control premium to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately 38 which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 

no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above in 2011 the fair value of our emea reporting unit exceeds its respective carrying value by more than 50 the fair value of our north american reporting unit is approximately 12 higher than its carrying value in 2011 where the fair value had been 12 and 18 higher than its carrying value in 2010 and 2009 respectively the 9732 million of goodwill attributed to the north america reporting unit constitutes approximately 68 of our total goodwill 

as a result of a reorganization of our internal business unit reporting structure and related internal financial reporting effective january 1 2012 we are changing from one operating segment to four operating segments and from six reporting units to ten reporting units the change will include converting our current north america medical business which will be one of the four operating segments from one reporting unit to five reporting units this change in reporting units requires us to allocate the assets and liabilities of north america medical to the new reporting units and then allocate goodwill using a relative fair value approach the goodwill attributable to the north america medical reporting unit was 9732 million at december 31 2011 we are currently completing the allocation process and will perform goodwill impairment tests on these new reporting units in the first quarter of 2012 this could result in impairment charges being recognized for one or more of these new reporting units in the first quarter of 2012 which could be material 

our expected future growth rates are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year which together more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle as a result of this analysis the compound annual growth rate of cash flows over the projected ten year period in the north america reporting unit is estimated to be 6 under the income approach significant changes in assumptions would be required for this reporting unit to fail the step one test for example an increase of over 1 in the discount rate or a decrease of over 25 percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required to indicate impairment for this reporting unit nevertheless while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable and achievable the possibility remains that the constant currency revenue growth of this reporting unit may not perform as expected and as a result the estimated fair value may decline if our strategy andor new products are not successful and we do not achieve core revenue growth in the future the goodwill in the north america reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges 

intangible assets 

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly 

  

of technology customer relationships and trade names the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method the excess earnings method measures economic benefit of an asset indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to the asset after appropriate returns are paid with respect to complementary or contributory assets the residual profit is taxeffected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream determining the useful life of an 

intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis or more frequently if necessary in connection with the analysis management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology described above under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of indefinitelived assets during the fourth quarter of 2011 are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill compound annual growth rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names ranged from 6 to 12 and a royalty rate of 4 was assumed discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 

no impairment in the carrying value of any of our trade names was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above nor would impairment be evident had the fair value of each our indefinitelived assets been hypothetically lower than presently estimated by 10 as of the date of the valuation 

we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets eg customer relationships instead longlived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and reassessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finitelived assets by among other things assessing customer attrition rates 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

  

the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows 

 

 significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

 

 product warranty liability 

we warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products that we will at our option repair or replace without charge such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect warranty periods vary by product we have recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty we accrue for product warranties when based on available information it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold and a reasonable estimate of the costs based on historical claims experience relative to sales can be made our estimated product warranty liability was 79 million and 109 million at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively the decrease in the reserve is due to the divestiture of businesses sold in 2011 

distributor rebates 

we offer rebates to certain distributors and accrue an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale the estimate is based on a historical experience rate of rebate claims by distributors over the previous 12 months for specific product lines the accrual for estimated rebates was 96 million and 102 million at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively 

sharebased compensation 

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 

  

accounting for income taxes 

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 663 million and 495 million at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under asc topic 740 “income taxes” which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business we are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known specifically we are currently in the midst of examinations by the canadian german czech republic and french taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which would affect our financial results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances the table below provides information regarding the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates shown below are the weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on interest rates in effect on december 31 2011 

 

 a change of 10 in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately 22 million for the year ended december 31 2012 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures these are primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar or the euro the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december 31 2011 was a net loss of 02 million the following table provides information regarding our open forward currency contracts as of december 31 2011 which mature in 2012 forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately 872 million 

forward currency contracts 

 

 a strengthening of 10 in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would on a combined basis adversely impact the translation of our nonus subsidiary net earnings and transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries by approximately 92 million for the year ended december 31 2012

as of december 31 2010 our backlog of firm orders for our aerospace segment was 74 million of which we expect approximately 100 percent to be filled in 2011 our backlog for our aerospace segment on december 31 2009 was 35 million 

commercial segment 

 

standard commercial segment products are typically shipped between a few days and three months after receipt of order therefore the backlog of such orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any future 12month period 

 

patents and trademarks 

 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

 

suppliers and materials 

 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we cannot be assured of successfully passing these cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

 

research and development 

 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development in our medical aerospace and commercial segments our research and development costs in our medical business principally relate to our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and our efforts to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures 

 

research and development in our aerospace and commercial businesses is focused on the development of lighter more durable and more automated systems and products that facilitate cargo loading and containment on commercial aircraft and improve the performance of recreational boats 

 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

 

seasonality 

 

portions of our revenues particularly in the commercial and medical segments are subject to seasonal fluctuations revenues in the marine aftermarket generally increase in the second quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming season incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to disposable medical products 

 

employees 

 

we employed approximately 12500 fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2010 of these employees approximately 3600 were employed in the united states and 8900 in countries outside of the united states less than 8 percent of our employees in the united states were covered by union contracts we 

also have collectivebargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover employees in other countries we believe we have good relationships with our employees

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

we are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

our medical segment is subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

the products within our medical segment are classified as medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries the regulations govern the development design approval manufacturing labeling importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our medical products these regulations are also subject to future change failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing shutdowns product shortages delays in product manufacturing product seizures recalls operating restrictions withdrawal or suspension of required licenses and prohibitions against exporting of products to or importing products from countries outside the united states we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines see for example the risk factor below titled “— if we are unable to resolve issues raised in our fda corporate warning letter it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our relationship with the fda and the perception of our products by hospitals clinics and physicians” in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in the united states before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we must first receive either 510k clearance or approval of a premarket approval or pma application from the fda unless an exemption applies in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that our proposed product is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the pma pathway requires us to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based in part on data obtained in human clinical trials similarly most major markets for medical devices outside the united states also require clearance approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis if at all in addition once a device has been cleared or approved a new clearance or approval may 

be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed furthermore the fda is currently reviewing its 510k clearance process and may make the process more rigorous which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data and expend more time and effort in obtaining future 510k product clearance the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in among other things delayed realization of product revenues in substantial additional costs or in limitations on indicated uses of products any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance such product approval or clearance by the fda can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or integrity issues relating to the marketing application later discovery of violations of fda requirements for medical devices could result in fda enforcement actions including warning letters fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances product seizures or recalls injunctions advisories or other field actions andor operating restrictions medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses promoting a device for an offlabel use could result in fda enforcement action 

 

furthermore our medical segment facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign governmental authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including the quality system regulation which requires testing complaint handling periodic audits design controls quality control testing and documentation procedures fda may also inspect for compliance with medical device reporting regulation which requires manufacturers to submit reports to fda of certain adverse events or malfunctions and whether the facilities have submitted notifications of product recalls or other corrective actions in accordance with fda regulations issues identified during such periodic inspections may result in warning letters manufacturing shutdowns product shortages product seizures or recalls fines and delays in product manufacturing and may require significant resources to resolve 

 

customers in our medical segment depend on third party coverage and reimbursement and the failure of healthcare programs to provide coverage and reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect our medical segment 

 

the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursements for our medical products is important to our medical segment demand for many of our existing and new medical products is and will continue to be affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business even when we develop or acquire a promising new product we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors internationally healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the level of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for many of our medical products could be adversely affected 

 

we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business by altering the extent to which potential customers select our products and the prices they are willing to pay or otherwise in addition as a result of their purchasing power and continually rising healthcare costs third party payors are implementing cost cutting measures such as discounts price reductions limitations on coverage and reimbursement for new medical technologies and procedures or other incentives from medical products suppliers these trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our existing products and potential new products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims that may be brought against us and recalls which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition furthermore as a medical device company we face an inherent risk of damage to our reputation if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective 

 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients many of these products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time and component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of the patient as a result we face an inherent risk of damage to our reputation if one or more of our products are or are alleged to be defective in addition our products for the aerospace and commercial industries are used in potentially hazardous environments although we carry product liability insurance we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage the outcome of litigation particularly any classaction lawsuits is difficult to quantify plaintiffs often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts including punitive damages the magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time and the cost to defend against any such litigation may be significant accordingly we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims 

 

in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may voluntarily participate or be required by applicable regulators to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety in the event of a recall we may experience lost sales and be exposed to individual or classaction litigation claims and reputational risk product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulation and enforcement our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 

 

we are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business the laws that may affect our ability to operate include 

 

 16 

 

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines the curtailment or restructuring of our operations the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 

 

further the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “healthcare reform act” among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback and criminal health care fraud statutes a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in addition the healthcare reform act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business 

 

the healthcare reform act also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers effective march 30 2013 such information will be made publicly available in a searchable format beginning september 30 2013 in addition device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission 

 

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing some states such as california massachusetts and vermont mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs along with the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance andor reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements 

 

if we are unable to resolve issues raised in our fda corporate warning letter it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our relationship with the fda and the perception of our products by hospitals clinics and physicians 

 

on october 11 2007 our subsidiary arrow received a corporate warning letter from the fda the letter expressed concerns with arrow’s quality systems including complaint handling corrective and preventive action process and design validation inspection and training procedures it also advised that arrow’s corporatewide program to evaluate correct and prevent quality system issues had been deficient 

 

our efforts to address the issues raised in the corporate warning letter have required the dedication of significant internal and external resources we developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to correct these previouslyidentified regulatory issues and further improve overall quality systems from the end of 2009 to the beginning of 2010 the fda reinspected the arrow facilities covered by the corporate warning letter and we have responded to the observations issued by the fda as a result of those inspections communications received from the fda indicate that the fda has classified its inspection observations as “voluntary action indicated” or vai this classification signifies that the fda has concluded that no further regulatory action is required and that any observations made during the inspections can be addressed voluntarily by us in addition in the third quarter of 2010 we submitted and received fda approval of all currently eligible requests 

for certificates to foreign governments or cfgs we believe that the fda’s approval of these cfg requests is a clear indication that we have substantially corrected the quality system issues identified in the corporate warning letter we are continuing to work with the fda to resolve all remaining issues and obtain formal closure of the corporate warning letter 

 

while we continue to believe we have substantially remediated the issues raised in the corporate warning letter through the corrective actions taken to date the corporate warning letter remains in place pending final resolution of all outstanding issues if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda we may have to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts and the fda may take further regulatory actions against us these actions may include seizing our product inventory assessing civil monetary penalties or seeking an injunction against us which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

health care reform including the recently enacted legislation may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations 

 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry to fundamental changes in march 2010 the healthcare reform act was enacted it substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers encourages improvements in the quality of health care items and services and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical and medical device industries among other things the healthcare reform act 

 

  

we currently estimate the impact of the 23 deductible excise tax to be approximately 160 million annually beginning 2013 however we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the healthcare reform act andor other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

 

an interruption in our manufacturing operations andor our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business 

 

many of our key products across all three of our business segments are manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of our facilities it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all in addition in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers it may not be possible to timely manufacture the affected products at previous levels or at all furthermore with respect to our medical segment in the event of a disruption in our supply of certain components or materials due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for such components or materials a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components that are acceptable to us could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

 

the research and development of some of our medical products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our medical products and the development of our medical products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and as public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge advice and input our medical products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face strong competition our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our results 

 

the medical device industry across all of our different product lines as well as in each geographic market in which our products are sold is highly competitive we compete with many medical device companies ranging from small startup enterprises which might only sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which may participate only in a specific market segment to companies that are larger and more established than us with access to significant financial and marketing resources 

 

in addition the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances also while our products for the aerospace and commercial industries generally have longer life cycles many of those products require changes in design or other enhancements to meet the evolving needs of our customers the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products our product development efforts may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as the inability to 

 

  

moreover we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products in addition our competitors may currently be developing or may develop and market in the future technologies that are more effective than those that we develop or which may render our products obsolete our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could reduce our revenues and margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

 

we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities research and development facilities sales personnel and customer support operations outside the united states in countries such as canada belgium the czech republic france germany ireland malaysia mexico norway and singapore as of december 31 2010 approximately 43 of our net property plant and equipment was located outside the united states in addition approximately 50 of our net revenues based on business unit location were derived from operations outside the united states in the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 approximately 71 of our fulltime and temporary employees as of december 31 2010 were employed in countries outside of the united states 

our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the united states including 

 

  

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made because of the predominance of governmentsponsored health care systems around the world many of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such antibribery laws our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws despite our training and compliance programs our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also could suffer severe penalties including criminal and civil penalties disgorgement and other remedial measures including further changes or enhancements to our procedures policies and controls as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions 

 

furthermore we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the united states including but not limited to the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury as well as the laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce these regulations limit our ability to market sell distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations we cannot assure you that there will not be a violation whether knowingly or inadvertently failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial penalties including fines and enforcement actions and civil andor criminal sanctions the disgorgement of profits and the 

imposition of a courtappointed monitor as well as the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in us government contracts and may have an adverse effect on our reputation 

 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

 

further weakness in general domestic and global economic growth combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets the credit and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent periods leading to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending these recessionary conditions have caused customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services while recent indicators suggest modest improvement in the united states and global economy we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more normalized spending behaviors if the recessionary conditions return our customers may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us in the future 

 

adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts receivable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us these types of actions by our suppliers could significantly affect our liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial market conditions we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

 

in addition the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet have increased significantly in recent years primarily as a result of the acquisition of arrow international in 2007 adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenue from products manufactured in and sold into nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our us dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currency in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

 

many of our products have significant plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities such as aluminum increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers particularly with respect to those products we sell pursuant to group purchase agreements and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers and thus adversely affect their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

our strategic initiatives may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income 

 

our strategies include making significant investments to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with announced restructuring realignment and cost reduction activities 

 

over the past few years we have announced several restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including significant realignments of our businesses employee terminations and product rationalizations while we have started to realize the efficiencies of these actions these activities may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits we expect further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in future charges moreover our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected and we could experience business disruptions with customers and elsewhere if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective 

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect our results 

 

as a company with significant operations outside of the united states we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions as a result our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our effective tax rate may however be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

in addition unfavorable results of tax audits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate among other things could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

we rely on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights although we own numerous us and foreign patents and have applied for numerous patent applications we cannot assure you that any pending patent applications will issue or that any patents issued or pending will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented by third parties in addition we rely on confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by unauthorized parties or competitors who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states there is no guarantee that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us misappropriate proprietary information or copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than our own which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed our inability to protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive harm that could adversely affect our business 

 

our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 

 

we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties any such claims whether or not meritorious could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel if we are found liable for infringement we may be required to enter into licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all or to pay damages and to cease making or selling certain products we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability any of the foregoing could be detrimental to our business 

 

other pending and future litigation may lead us to incur significant costs and have an adverse effect on our business 

 

we also are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities litigation and violations 

 

we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 

 23 

 

these laws and government regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover we may become subject to additional environmental claims which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our past present or future business activities which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our aerospace segment is subject to government regulation which may require us to incur expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

the us federal aviation administration the “faa” regulates the manufacture and sale of some of our aerospace products and licenses for the operation of our repair stations comparable agencies such as the european aviation safety agency in europe the “easa” regulate these matters in other countries if we fail to qualify for or obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a qualification or license previously granted the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be expensive and time consuming 

 

from time to time the faa the easa or comparable agencies propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations these changes or new regulations generally increase the costs of compliance to the extent the faa the easa or comparable agencies implement regulatory changes we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance 

 

if we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired which would adversely affect our consolidated results and our ability to operate our business and our stock price 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 

 

any failure on our part to remedy any identified control deficiencies or any delays or errors in our financial reporting would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services 

 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 approximately 15 of our net revenues were generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business 

 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had total consolidated indebtedness of 9171 million 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness it could also have significant effects on our business for example it could 

 

  

despite current substantial indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 

 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including secured indebtedness for example as of december 31 2010 after taking into account the limitations under the covenants under our senior credit agreement and our outstanding senior notes issued in 2004 which we refer to as the “senior notes” we would have had approximately 4222 million borrowing capacity consisting of 3963 million of aggregate borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and 259 million of borrowing capacity under our accounts receivable securitization facility adding new indebtedness to current debt levels could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our existing debt obligations 

 

our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations 

 

our senior credit agreement and the senior notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests such as incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments and engage in certain acquisitions our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debts 

 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures research and development efforts working capital acquisitions and other general corporate purposes depends on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to 

 

 25 

 

  

in addition we may not be able to affect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness and other factors including market conditions 

 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the notes 

 

we are a holding company substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries our ability to repay our debt depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us 

 

we are a holding company substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries which are separate and distinct legal entities therefore our ability to service our indebtedness is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds whether by dividend distribution or loan from our subsidiaries none of our subsidiaries is obligated to make funds available to us for payment on our existing debt we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends distributions or loans to fund payments on our existing debt in addition any payment of dividends distributions or loans to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate furthermore payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings 

 

in the event of a bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries such subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us 

 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

 

holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors including our financial condition earnings compliance with debt instruments legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we cannot assure you that our cash dividend will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 

 

the contingent conversion features of our convertible notes if triggered may adversely affect our financial condition 

 

in august 2010 we issued 400 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 which we refer to as the “convertible notes” the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock beginning on may 1 2017 or earlier upon the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the convertible note terms see “convertible notes” under note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion regarding the conversion terms of the convertible notes if the convertible notes become eligible for conversion and one or more holders elect to convert their notes unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than cash in lieu of any fractional shares we would be required to settle a portion of or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity in addition even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes if the method of settlement effective during the period reflected in the financial statements is cash settlement or combination settlement we would 

be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than longterm liability in such financial statements which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital 

 

the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes may affect the value of our common stock 

 

in connection with our issuance of the convertible notes we entered into privately negotiated hedge transactions with third parties which we refer to as the hedge counterparties the hedge transactions cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the convertible notes and are expected to reduce our exposure to potential dilution with respect to our common stock andor reduce our exposure to potential cash payments that may be required to be made by us upon conversion of the convertible notes separately we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions relating to the same number of shares of our common stock with the hedge counterparties with a strike price of 74648 subject to customary antidilution adjustments pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue shares of our common stock the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock or if we so elect obligate us to make cash payments to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants 

 

in connection with establishing its initial hedges of the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates entered into various cashsettled overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the convertible notes the hedge counterparties andor their affiliates may in their sole discretion with or without notice modify their hedge positions from time to time and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to the conversion of the convertible notes by entering into or unwinding various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock andor by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions andor open market transactions the effect if any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions 

 

each hedge counterparty is a financial institution or the affiliate of a financial institution and we will be subject to the risk that one or more hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions our exposure to the credit risk of each hedge counterparty will not be secured by any collateral recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions including a bankruptcy filing by lehman brothers holdings inc and its various affiliates if a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the convertible note hedge transaction with that hedge counterparty our exposure will depend on many factors but generally the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock market price and in volatility of our common stock in addition upon a default by a hedge counterparty we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties 

 

we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock including in connection with conversions of our convertible notes which could lower the price of our common stock 

 

we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock as of december 31 2010 we had outstanding approximately 400 million shares of our common stock options to purchase approximately 23 million shares of our common stock of which approximately 15 million were vested as of that date approximately 04 million of restricted stock awards 

which are expected to vest over the next three years and approximately 30000 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan in addition a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options upon conversion of the convertible notes and upon the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common stock 

 

if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock it may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock furthermore the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock issuable upon any conversion of the convertible notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the anticipated issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 

 

certain provisions of our corporate governing documents and delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 

 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock for example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series the consideration dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion or exchange rights and voting rights if any of unissued series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders thus our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 or more of our common stock these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock 

 

certain provisions in our convertible notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us 

 

certain provisions in the convertible notes and the indenture governing the convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us for example if an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash in addition if an acquisition event constitutes a makewhole fundamental change we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with such acquisition event in either case and in other cases our obligations under the convertible notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

on october 11 2007 the company’s subsidiary arrow international inc “arrow” received a corporate warning letter from the us food and drug administration fda the letter expressed concerns with arrow’s quality systems including complaint handling corrective and preventive action process and design validation inspection and training procedures it also advised that arrow’s corporatewide program to evaluate correct and prevent quality system issues had been deficient 

 

the company developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to correct the issues raised in the letter and further improve overall quality systems from the end of 2009 to the beginning of 2010 the fda reinspected the arrow facilities covered by the corporate warning letter and arrow has responded to the observations issued by the fda as a result of those inspections communications received from the fda indicate 

that the fda has classified its inspection observations as “voluntary action indicated” or vai this classification signifies that the fda has concluded that no further regulatory action is required and that any observations made during the inspections can be addressed voluntarily by the company in addition in the third quarter of 2010 arrow submitted and received fda approval of all currently eligible requests for certificates to foreign governments or cfgs the company believes that the fda’s approval of its cfg requests is a clear indication that arrow has substantially corrected the quality system issues identified in the corporate warning letter the company is continuing to work with the fda to resolve all remaining issues and obtain formal closure of the corporate warning letter 

 

while the company continues to believe it has substantially remediated the issues raised in the corporate warning letter through the corrective actions taken to date the corporate warning letter remains in place pending final resolution of all outstanding issues which the company is actively working with the fda to resolve if the company’s remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda the company may have to devote additional financial and human resources to its efforts and the fda may take further regulatory actions against the company 

 

in addition we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability intellectual property employment and environmental matters based on information currently available advice of counsel established reserves and other resources we do not believe that any such actions are likely to be individually or in the aggregate material to our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity however in the event of unexpected further developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters or other similar matters if unfavorable may be materially adverse to our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

the terms of our senior credit facility and senior notes issued in 2004 provide for the maintenance of specified financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and payment of cash dividends under the most restrictive of these provisions on an annual basis 285 million of retained earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at december 31 2010 on february 23 2011 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 034 per share on our common stock which is payable on march 15 2011 to holders of record on march 4 2011 as of february 23 2011 we had approximately 761 holders of record of our common stock

the following graph provides a comparison of five year cumulative total stockholder returns of teleflex common stock the standard  poor’s sp 500 stock index the sp midcap 400 index and the sp 500 healthcare equipment  supply index in subsequent annual reports we intend to use the sp 500 healthcare equipment  supply index in place of the sp midcap 400 index in prior years we referenced the sp midcap 400 index because due to the traditionally diverse nature of our businesses we did not believe that there existed a relevant published industry or lineofbusiness index and we did not believe we could reasonably identify a peer group however as we are now principally a provider of medical technology products we have decided that the sp 500 healthcare equipment  supply index is a more appropriate benchmark against which to measure our stock performance in accordance with sec regulations the graph below references both the sp midcap 400 index and the sp 500 healthcare equipment  supply index the annual changes for the fiveyear period shown on the graph are based on the assumption that 100 had been invested in teleflex common stock and each index on december 31 2005 and that all dividends were reinvested

overview 

 

we are a leading global provider of medical technology products that enable healthcare providers to improve patient outcomes reduce infections and enhance patient and provider safety we primarily develop manufacture and supply singleuse medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications we serve hospitals and healthcare providers in more than 130 countries and are not dependent upon any one endmarket or procedure 

 

we are focused on achieving consistent sustainable and profitable growth through 

 

  

furthermore we believe our research and development capabilities and our commitment to engineering excellence and lean lowcost manufacturing allow us to consistently bring cost effective innovative products to market that improve the safety efficacy and quality of healthcare we provide a broadbased platform of medical products which we categorize into four groups critical care surgical care cardiac care and oem and development services 

 

we have employed a disciplined portfolio management strategy to transform teleflex into primarily a medical technology company we expect to continue to increase the relative composition of our medical segment through a combination of portfolio management and organic growth initiatives we may seek acquisition opportunities that augment our existing medical technology platform and disposition opportunities that enable us to further our transformation into a pureplay medical technology company furthermore our commitment to becoming a pureplay global medical technology company involves investing in our medical research and development and sales and marketing initiatives to further expand and strengthen our portfolio of products as well as our ability to penetrate existing and new geographic and therapeutic markets 

 

while we are committed to becoming a pureplay medical technology company we continue to have businesses that serve other nonmedical niche segments of the aerospace and commercial markets with specialty engineered products we expect to strategically divest our noncore aerospace and commercial segments over time our aerospace products include cargohandling systems containers and pallets for commercial air cargo our commercial products include driver controls engine assemblies and drive parts for the marine industry 

our leading brands include 

 

 

 

over the past several years we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions principally in our medical segment and divestitures in both our aerospace and commercial segments these portfolio actions resulted in a significant expansion of our medical segment operations and a significant reduction in our aerospace and commercial segment operations as a result our medical segment now accounts for approximately 80 of our revenues from continuing operations and over 85 of our segment operating profit 

 

below is a listing of our more significant acquisitions and divestitures that have occurred since 2007 the results for the acquired businesses are included in their respective segments see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k filed for additional information regarding our significant divestitures

health care reform 

 

on march 23 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law while providing some clarity on the impact of reform to our industry this legislation will nevertheless have a significant impact on our business for medical device companies such as teleflex the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare which could negatively affect pricing of our products in addition commencing in 2013 the legislation imposes a 23 excise tax on sales of medical devices as this new law is implemented over the next 23 years we will be in a better position to ascertain its impact on our business we currently estimate the impact of the medical device excise tax will be approximately 16 million annually beginning in 2013 also in the first quarter of 2010 we evaluated the change in the tax regulations related to the medicare part d subsidy as currently outlined in the new legislation and determined that it did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 

 

  

global recessionary conditions during 2009 and 2008 had adverse impacts on market activities including among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity and reduced demand for products and services of the past few years for teleflex these economic developments principally affected our aerospace and commercial segments and in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in the first half of 2009 although on a consolidated basis the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity during 2010 and 2009 the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth constricted credit and public sector austerity measures in response to growing public budget deficits could adversely affect our operations in the future as described below the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources” in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels during 2009 and generally did not replenish inventories to prerecession levels during 2010 the impact of these actions was most pronounced in capital goods markets which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses our orthopedic oem business was impacted in 2009 by delayed new product launches by our oem customers this has improved somewhat during 2010 but has not returned to prerecession levels approximately 90 percent of our medical revenues come from disposable products used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers 

 

in europe some countries have taken austerity measures due to the current economic climate elective surgeries have been delayed and hospital budgets have been reduced in certain countries mainly germany we have seen changes in the local reimbursement to home care patients and pricing impacts on business awarded through the tendering process these markets have introduced more buying groups and gpo’s driving commodity product pricing downwards it is possible that funding for publically funded healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs during 2010 the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which has resulted in a slow down in payments to us we believe this situation will continue unless and until these countries are able to find alternative funding sources to their respective public healthcare sectors in 2010 sales into the public hospital systems in these countries were approximately 4 of our total sales 

 

in asia recovery from the global recession varies by country china has announced plans for major healthcare investment targeted at second tier citieshospitals which may provide future growth opportunities for us while slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan will limit growth in that market

results of operations 

 

discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelvemonth period 

 

the following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations of the actuation heavy lift ssi ati and power systems businesses which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and “discontinued operations” in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for discussion of discontinued operations 

 

revenues 

 

 

 

net revenues increased approximately 2 to 180 billion in 2010 from 177 billion in 2009 core growth was 3 which was partially offset by the 1 decline in revenue attributed to the disposition of a product line in the commercial segment during the first quarter of 2009 and the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in our medical segment in the first quarter of 2010 due to the adoption of new accounting guidance core revenues were 7 higher in the aerospace segment due to improving conditions in commercial aviation markets and 16 higher in the commercial segment as recreational boating markets recover from the depressed levels of 2009 core revenues in the medical segment were 1 higher than 2009 as the negative impact of a voluntary recall of a product in our critical care product group and lower sales of orthopedic devices sold to medical original equipment manufacturers or oems was more than offset by higher sales of other critical care and surgical products 

 

net revenues decreased approximately 8 to 177 billion in 2009 from 191 billion in 2008 a reduction in core revenues caused 5 of the decline while foreign currency movements caused the other 3 of the decline as a result of 2 core growth in the fourth quarter in the medical segment core revenue in that segment was flat in 2009 compared to 2008 but core revenue declined in the aerospace and commercial segments by 23 and 15 respectively in 2009 compared to 2008 weak global economic conditions negatively impacted markets served by our aerospace and commercial segments throughout 2009 

 

gross profit 

 

 

 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 441 in 2010 from 437 in 2009 gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased in each of our three segments compared to the corresponding periods of 2009 with the most pronounced increase in the aerospace segment as a result of core growth manufacturing efficiencies and a sales mix favoring higher margin spare components and repairs 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 437 in 2009 from 419 in 2008 with all three segments experiencing increases in gross profit as a percentage of revenues the principal factors that impact the overall increase were a higher percentage of medical revenues 81 of total revenues in 2009 compared to 77 in 2008 a 7 million fair value adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of 2008 related to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which did not recur in 2009 synergies from the arrow acquisition and manufacturing cost reductions implemented in each of our three segments partly offset by higher pension expense in 2009 because of the decline in the value of our pension assets at the end of 2008 as a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets 

 

  selling general and administrative 

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 264 in 2010 compared to 257 in 2009 the 21 million increase in costs was principally related to 23 million in higher costs in the medical segment largely due to investments in sales marketing and clinical education programs of approximately 16 million approximately 10 million of costs associated with product recall and remediation activities partially offset by approximately 4 million lower spending on remediation of fda regulatory issues professional fees incurred in connection with our debt refinancing during the third quarter of 2010 of approximately 2 million was offset by reductions in the aerospace and commercial segments and corporate costs of approximately 2 million 

 

selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 257 in 2009 compared to 263 in 2008 the reduction in the dollar value of these costs was principally the result of cost reduction initiatives throughout the company including restructuring and integration activities in connection with the arrow acquisition and the 2008 commercial segment restructuring program and lower spending on remediation of fda regulatory issues these factors resulted in an aggregate reduction in expenses of approximately 48 million 

 

  research and development 

 

 

 

research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were 24 in 2010 compared to 21 in 2009 higher levels of research and development expenses over the two year period reflect increased investments related to antimicrobial technologies and the establishment of an innovation center in malaysia 

 

  goodwill impairment 

 

 

 

during the second quarter of 2009 we performed an interim review of goodwill for our cargo container reporting unit as a result of the difficult market conditions confronting the reporting unit and the significant deterioration in its operating performance which accelerated in the second quarter of 2009 upon conclusion of this review we determined that goodwill in the cargo container operations was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 67 million in the second quarter of 2009 

  interest income and expense 

 

 

 

interest expense decreased 95 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a reduction in average outstanding debt coupled with lower average interest rates in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting the refinancing transaction that occurred in the third quarter of 2010 

 

interest expense decreased in 2009 due to an approximate 350 million reduction in debt during the year principally reflecting the 240 million of debt repaid in the first quarter of 2009 from the proceeds of the sale of the ati business 

 

  loss on extinguishment of debt 

 

in 2010 we recognized losses on the extinguishment of debt of 466 million as a result of our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 and prepayment of notes in the fourth quarter of 2010 in connection with our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 we prepaid our senior notes issued in 2007 the “2007 notes” and recognized debt extinguishment costs of approximately 288 million comprised of a prepayment makewhole fee of 281 million the writeoff of 06 million of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions and related legal fees also in connection with our refinancing transactions in the third quarter of 2010 we prepaid 200 million of our senior credit facility and recognized additional losses on the extinguishment of debt of 16 million related to the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions in the fourth quarter of 2010 we prepaid our senior notes issued in 2004 the “2004 notes” and together with 2007 notes the “senior notes” and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 163 million comprised of a prepayment makewhole fee of 155 million the writeoff of 07 million of unamortized debt issuance costs incurred prior to the refinancing transactions and related legal fees see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

 

  taxes on income from continuing operations 

 

 

 

the effective tax rate in 2010 was 148 compared to 206 in 2009 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2010 were 219 million compared to 351 million in 2009 the decrease in the effective income tax rate reflects the impact of beneficial discrete tax charges and a reduction in reserves for uncertain tax positions as audits and settlements were closed and fewer new reserves were established 

 

the effective tax rate in 2009 was 206 compared to 317 in 2008 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2009 were 351 million compared to 379 million in 2008 the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to i a decrease in deferred state tax liabilities resulting from changes to applicable state tax laws and ii a reduction in reserves for uncertain tax positions as audits and settlements were closed and fewer new reserves were established than in the prior year 

  restructuring and other impairment charges 

 

 

 

in december 2008 we began certain restructuring initiatives that affect the commercial segment these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at three of our facilities in europe and north america we implemented these initiatives as a means to address expected weaknesses in the marine and industrial markets by december 31 2009 we completed the 2008 commercial segment restructuring program and all costs associated with the program were fully paid during 2009 therefore no charges were recorded under this program in 2010 

 

in connection with the acquisition of arrow during 2007 we formulated a plan related to the integration of arrow and our other medical businesses the integration plan focused on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing sales marketing and distribution functions in north america europe and asia costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of arrow have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow and are not included in these results costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of teleflex are charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations these costs amounted to approximately 29 million during 2010 as of december 31 2010 we expect future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the arrow integration plan if any will be nominal 

 

in june 2006 we began certain restructuring initiatives that affected all three of our operating segments these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america we took these initiatives as a means to improving operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources and these activities are now complete 

 

for additional information regarding our restructuring programs see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

during the second quarter of 2009 we recorded 23 million in impairment charges with respect to an intangible asset in our commercial segment during the third quarter of 2009 based on continued deterioration in the california real estate market we recorded 33 million in impairment charges to fully writeoff an investment in a real estate venture in california we initially invested in the venture in 2004 by contributing property and other assets that had been part of one of its former manufacturing sites 

 

impairment charges in 2008 included 27 million related to five of our minority held investments precipitated by the deteriorating economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 52 million related to medical segment facilities that were reclassified to held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2008 15 million related to facilities in the commercial segment involved in the 2008 commercial segment restructuring program 08 million related to an intangible asset in the commercial segment that was identified during the annual impairment testing process and a 02 million reduction in the carrying value of a building held for sale 

segment review 

 

 

 

the percentage increases or decreases in revenues during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 compared to the respective prior years were due to the following factors 

 

 

 

 

  

the following is a discussion of our segment operating results additional information regarding our segments including a reconciliation of segment operating profit to income from continuing operations before interest extinguishments of debt taxes and minority interest is presented in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

medical 

 

comparison of 2010 and 2009 

 

medical segment net revenues for 2010 of 14333 million were essentially unchanged from the 14349 million reported in the same period last year as core growth of 1 was offset by the impact of the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity 1 the increase in core revenue was predominantly in the european and asialatin american critical care product groups and oem specialty sutures and other devices offset by declines in oem orthopedic implant products and in north american surgical products 

net revenues for 2010 2009 and 2008 by product group for the medical segment are comprised of the following 

 

 

 

 

  

critical care 

 

critical care revenues in 2010 were negatively impacted approximately 17 million when compared to 2009 due to the recall of our custom iv tubing product during the first quarter of 2010 which contributed to a decline in vascular access sales this decline was offset by higher sales of other vascular access and urology products in north america and europe anesthesia products in europe north america and asialatin america and respiratory products in north america and asialatin america compared with the prior year 

 

surgical care 

 

surgical core revenue increased 1 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher ligation sales in asialatin america and europe partially offset by lower sales of general instrument and closure devices in north america 

 

cardiac care 

 

sales of cardiac care products in 2010 compared to 2009 were affected positively by higher sales of intra aortic balloon pumps and catheters primarily in european markets offset by an approximate 3 million impact from the recall of certain intraaortic balloon catheters during the fourth quarter of 2010 

 

original equipment manufacturers “oem” and development services 

 

sales of devices to oems increased approximately 44 million in 2010 compared to 2009 core revenue to oems increased 4 in 2010 compared with 2009 this increase is largely attributable to higher sales of specialty suture and catheter fabrication products partially offset by lower sales of orthopedic implant products and forged instruments due to customer inventory rebalancing and a reduction in new product launches by oem customers 

 

medical segment operating profit decreased 9 in 2010 from 3026 million in 2009 to 2761 million in 2010 operating results for 2010 were negatively impacted by approximately 22 million in costs associated with the recall and remediation of our custom iv tubing product and certain intraaortic balloon catheters and a factory shut down associated with the custom iv tubing product approximately 4 million for other product remediation activities approximately 6 million in higher research and development costs and approximately 16 million in higher costs for sales marketing and clinical education programs these factors more than offset the positive contribution of approximately 17 million from higher sales volumes of products not affected by 

the impact of product recalls approximately 5 million lower manufacturing costs as a result of cost reduction initiatives and approximately 4 million lower expenses related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues 

 

comparison of 2009 and 2008 

 

medical segment net revenues declined 3 in 2009 to 14349 million from 14756 million in 2008 entirely due to foreign currency fluctuations mainly the stronger us dollar against the euro during the first three quarters of 2009 in the aggregate we experienced no growth in core revenue in 2009 over 2008 as growth in critical care products in europe and asialatin america of approximately 11 million was offset by approximately 9 million lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation products to oems in north america and approximately 8 million lower sales of surgical products in north america and europe 

 

critical care 

 

the decrease in critical care product sales during 2009 compared to 2008 was entirely due to currency fluctuations as core revenue in this product group increased approximately 1 in 2009 higher sales of vascular access urology and anesthesia products of approximately 12 million were partially offset by approximately 6 million lower sales of respiratory products principally as a result of distributor destocking in north america in early 2009 

 

surgical care 

 

surgical product sales declined approximately 4 in 2009 compared to 2008 foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by approximately 3 and lower sales in the instrumentation product line in europe and north america led the 1 decline in core revenue we believe this decline in sales resulted from hospitals limiting their capital budgets for these products and distributors reducing inventory in the supply chain 

 

cardiac care 

 

the decrease in sales of cardiac care products in 2009 compared to 2008 is mainly due to currency movements hospital capital budget constraints and a voluntary product recall during the first quarter of 2009 

 

oem and development services 

 

sales of devices to oems decreased primarily as a result of approximately 9 million lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation as higher sales of specialty sutures and other devices of approximately 2 million was offset by the impact of currency movements a reduction in new product launches by oem customers and overall weakness in oem orthopedic markets due to hospital budgetary constraints and postponement of certain elective surgical procedures have had a negative impact on demand for our orthopedic instrumentation products 

 

operating profit in the medical segment increased 7 in 2009 to 3026 million from 2830 million in 2008 the negative impact on operating profit from a stronger us dollar during the first three quarters of 2009 was more than offset by approximately 20 million of lower manufacturing and selling general and administrative costs during 2009 as a result of cost reduction initiatives including restructuring and integration activities in connection with the arrow acquisition and approximately 18 million lower expenses related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues also a 7 million expense for fair value adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of 2008 related to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which did not recur in 2009 had a favorable impact on the comparison of 2009 operating profit to the prior year 

aerospace 

 

comparison of 2010 and 2009 

 

aerospace segment net revenues increased 6 in 2010 to 1735 million from 1633 million in 2009 during 2010 core revenue increased 7 while currency movements decreased sales by 1 the core growth is due principally to improvement in the commercial aviation market particularly in the second half of 2010 which led to higher sales of widebody cargo handling systems cargo system spare components and repairs and cargo containers 

 

segment operating profit increased 134 in 2010 to 225 million compared to 96 million in 2009 the higher operating profit in 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 was primarily due to approximately 4 million in higher sales volumes approximately 3 million resulting from a favorable sales mix of higher margin cargo system spare components and repairs and approximately 3 million in manufacturing efficiencies achieved in the production of cargo containers and widebody cargo handling systems for aircraft manufacturers 

 

comparison of 2009 and 2008 

 

aerospace segment net revenues declined 27 in 2009 to 1633 million from 2241 million in 2008 core revenue reductions accounted for nearly all 23 of the decline in revenue weakness in the commercial aviation sector throughout 2009 resulted in reduced sales to commercial airlines and freight carriers of wide body cargo spare components and repairs and cargo containers this market weakness has also reduced the number of aftermarket cargo system conversions resulting in lower sales of multideck wide body cargo handling systems which offset the impact of higher sales of single deck wide body systems on passenger aircraft 

 

segment operating profit decreased 41 in 2009 to 96 million from 163 million in 2008 this decline was principally due to the sharply lower sales volumes across all product lines including the unfavorable mix in 2009 of lower margin single deck system sales compared with a mix in 2008 that was weighted more toward aftermarket multideck system conversions and spares and repairs the impact from lower sales volumes was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives that resulted in operating cost reductions of approximately 9 million during 2009 

 

commercial 

 

comparison of 2010 and 2009 

 

commercial segment net revenues increased approximately 16 in 2010 to 1949 million from 1681 million in 2009 core growth of 16 and favorable currency movements of 1 were partially offset by the impact from the divestiture of a marine product line in the first quarter of 2009 1 higher sales of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market and spare parts in the marine aftermarket accounted for 20 of sales growth while lower sales of industrial nonmarine products negatively impacted sales growth by 4 

 

commercial segment operating income increased 67 to 180 million compared to 108 million for the same period last year this increase principally was due to approximately 6 million in higher sales volumes of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market and spare parts in the marine aftermarket as well as a reduction in factory costs of approximately 4 million resulting from facility consolidations in 2009 partially offset by the stronger canadian dollar which resulted in a negative impact on our costs of approximately 3 million 

comparison of 2009 and 2008 

 

commercial segment net revenues declined by approximately 21 in 2009 to 1681 million from 2124 million in 2008 core revenue reductions accounted for 15 of the decline which was principally the result of a decrease in sales of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market 22 partially offset by approximately 20 million of higher sales of the modern burner unit to the us military 

 

in 2009 segment operating profit decreased 21 to 108 million compared to 137 million in 2008 this decrease was principally due to the lower sales volumes of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market which more than offset the impact from the elimination of approximately 8 million of operating costs in 2009 and higher sales of the modern burner unit to the us military 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends common stock repurchases adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to other capital markets 

 

we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs however in light of global economic conditions over the past few years there is a risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity if global economic conditions deteriorate we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our customers’ purchases from us which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

 

the deterioration in the securities markets that occurred during 2008 and the subsequent moderate recovery in these markets during 2009 and 2010 impacted the market value of the assets included in our defined benefit pension plans as a result of these market fluctuations the market value of assets in our domestic pension funds declined in value by approximately 76 million during 2008 and recovered approximately 65 million through 2010 in september 2010 we made a 30 million cash contribution to the teleflex retirement income plan to improve the funded status of the pension plan the volatility in the securities markets has not significantly affected the liquidity of our pension plans or counterparty exposure a majority of the assets in our domestic pension plans are invested in mutual funds registered with the sec under the investment company act of 1940 underlying holdings of the mutual funds are primarily invested in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities 

 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and will continue to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

 

we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of our debt service requirements substantially all of which relate to united states indebtedness because the net cash provided by usbased operating activities alone is not sufficient accordingly we repatriated approximately 123 million and 363 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements these cash distributions are subject to tax in the us at the corporate tax rate reduced by applicable foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid on distributed earnings approximately 626 million of our 2066 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was generated in the us and approximately 235 million of our 1722 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was generated in the us 

during 2010 and 2009 we repaid approximately 727 million and 359 million respectively of debt from the proceeds of the issuance of convertible debt the sale of businesses and from cash generated from operations as a result we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until october 2012 our next scheduled senior note principal payment is in july 2011 for approximately 73 million we anticipate our domestic interest payments for 2011 will be approximately 52 million to the extent we cannot or choose not to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements our revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner 

 

we expect to receive approximately 10 million in principal amount of zero coupon greek treasury bonds in settlement of amounts due us from sales to the public hospital system in greece for 2007 2008 and 2009 the bonds mature over a three year period at december 31 2010 we provided an allowance of 25 million to reflect the respective outstanding receivables at that date at the fair value of greek treasury bonds with a comparable maturity 

 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations 

 

refinancing transactions 

 

in august 2010 we entered into a series of refinancing transactions comprised of i a public offering of 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 3875 convertible senior subordinated notes due 2017 the “convertible notes” ii the amendment of certain terms of our senior credit facilities iii the extension of the maturity of a portion of our borrowings under the senior credit facilities iv the repayment of 2000 million of borrowings under the senior credit facilities v the amendment of certain terms of our senior notes and vi the prepayment of all of our 2007 notes which had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of 1966 million and were scheduled to mature in 2012 and 2014 the refinancing transactions were designed to improve near term liquidity and financial flexibility by extending debt maturities see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for information on the refinancing 

 

prepayment of 2004 notes 

 

in december 2010 we prepaid 1658 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2004 notes of this amount i 725 million was applied to the 666 series 20041 tranche a senior notes due 7811 ii 483 million was applied to the 714 series 20041 tranche b senior notes due 7814 and iii 450 million was applied to the 746 series 20041 tranche c senior notes due 7816 see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the partial prepayment of the 2004 notes 

 

on february 23 2011 we began to prepay the remaining aggregate principal amount of the 2004 notes see note 19 “subsequent events” to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

cash flows 

 

the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented 

 

 

 

cash flow from operating activities 

 

comparison of 2010 and 2009 

 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately 2066 million during 2010 year over year cash flow from operating activities increased 344 million over the comparable period in 2009 cash flow from operations in 2009 was adversely affected by a 975 million tax payment on the sale of the ati businesses while the 2010 increase reflects a tax refund of 595 million and lower payments for interest and restructuring and integration programs the increase was partly offset by a 246 million increase in our contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans in 2010 over the comparable period in 2009 and an increase in receivables of 397 million that resulted from the adoption of an amendment to financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 860 “transfers and servicing” “asc topic 860” in the first quarter of 2010 specifically upon adoption of the amendment the accounts receivable that we previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet under our securitization program are now required to be accounted for as secured borrowings and reflected as shortterm debt on our balance sheet the effect of the amendment is reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows under financing activities in the increase decrease in notes payable and current borrowings and under operating activities in the accounts receivable use of cash underlying these activities cash flow from continuing operations in 2010 compared to 2009 was further reduced by higher receivables primarily in europe reflecting the continued slow down in payments from public hospitals in italy spain portugal and greece where funding continues to be under pressure due to weak economic conditions and higher inventories in north america in advance of the coming flu season 

 

comparison of 2009 and 2008 

 

lower tax payments of approximately 25 million and lower interest payments of approximately 25 million were the primary contributors to the higher cash flow from continuing operations in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately 106 million during 2009 which was comprised of a reduction in income taxes payable of approximately 117 million offset by the impact from a reduction of working capital of approximately 11 million the reduction in taxes includes 975 million of taxes paid in connection with the sale of the ati businesses in 2009 the reduction in working capital results principally from i lower inventory due largely to inventory control efforts in both the aerospace and commercial segments in response to weak demand during 2009 coupled with deliveries of cargo handling systems in the aerospace segment that had been delayed from 2008 into 2009 ii lower accounts receivable primarily in the aerospace segment reflecting lower sales partly offset by higher receivables in the medical segment due to a slow down in payments from 

public hospitals in italy spain portugal and greece where funding has been under pressure due to weak economic conditions these reductions in cash flow were partly offset by iii lower accounts payable and accrued expenses largely due to reduced spending on inventory in the aerospace segment coupled with reduced payments of termination benefits and contract termination costs in restructuring and integration reserves 

 

cash flow from investing activities 

 

investing activities from continuing operations provided net cash of 1484 million in 2010 primarily due to 247 million in proceeds from the sale of ssi 500 million from the sale of heavy lift and 939 million from the sale of the actuation business partly offset by capital expenditures of 335 million 

 

our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations in 2009 consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales of the ati businesses and power systems operations partly offset by capital expenditures of 287 million 

 

cash flow from financing activities 

 

financing activities from continuing operations used net cash of 3366 million in 2010 during the third quarter of 2010 in connection with the refinancing of a portion of our longterm debt we issued 4000 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes as part of our effort to reduce the potential dilution resulting from the issuance of our common stock andor reduce our exposure to potential cash payments we may be required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes we entered into hedging transactions involving the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information we used approximately 880 million of the convertible note proceeds to purchase the call options which was partially offset by the receipt of 594 million from the sale of the warrants we used 2000 million of the convertible note proceeds to repay term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility in connection with the refinancing transactions we incurred 214 million of transaction fees and expenses including underwriters’ discounts and commissions we used the remainder of the net proceeds together with available cash to prepay all of our outstanding 2007 notes at an aggregate prepayment purchase price equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of 1966 million plus a prepayment makewhole amount of 281 million during the fourth quarter of 2010 we prepaid 1658 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2004 notes which required the payment to the 2004 noteholders of a prepayment makewhole amount of 155 million we also paid 543 million of dividends these reductions in cash flows from financing activities were partly offset by the 294 million increase in notes payable and current borrowings as a result of the application of the amendment to asc topic 860 discussed above to our securitization program which resulted in the reporting of the securitization program as a secured borrowing in 2010 

 

our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations in 2009 consisted primarily of 3576 million repayment of longterm debt and payment of dividends of 540 million partly offset by borrowings of 100 million under our revolving credit facility 

financing arrangements 

 

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

 

 

 

fixed rate borrowings excluding the effect of derivative instruments comprised 53 of total borrowings at december 31 2010 fixed rate borrowings including the effect of derivative instruments comprised 91 of total borrowings at december 31 2010 less than 1 of our total borrowings of 9171 million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the renminbi 

 

our senior credit and senior note agreements contain covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements these agreements also require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3501 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than 3501 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement at december 31 2010 our consolidated leverage ratio was 2651 and our interest coverage ratio was 4681 both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence 

 

at december 31 2010 we had no borrowings outstanding and approximately 4 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 400 million revolving credit facility this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility throughout 2010 until we borrowed 90 million on december 20 2010 to prepay a portion of the 2004 notes including fees and makewhole premium we then repaid this amount from the proceeds of the sale of the actuation business on december 31 2010 the availability of loans under this facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit agreement and senior note agreements moreover additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur notwithstanding these restrictions we believe that this revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december 31 2010 we would have been permitted 285 million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31 2010 moreover additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 

as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all other terms of the senior credit agreement and the senior notes and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements including the leverage and interest coverage ratios throughout 2011 

 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

in addition we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 750 million to a commercial paper conduit as of december 31 2010 the maximum amount available for borrowing was 259 million this facility is utilized from time to time for increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility 

 

stock repurchase programs 

 

on june 14 2007 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of our outstanding common stock repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generation from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition our senior loan agreements limit the aggregate amount of share repurchases and other restricted payments we may make to 75 million per year in the event our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds 35 to 1 accordingly these provisions may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization through december 31 2010 no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 

 

contractual obligations 

 

contractual obligations at december 31 2010 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 626 million and 1099 million as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any 

income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 

 

in 2010 cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were 321 million and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be in the range of 72 million to 10 million in 2011 due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates and other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2011 

 

see notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for certain equipment the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately 91 million see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

 

accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable considering the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 41 million at december 31 2010 and 71 million at december 31 2009 which was 13 and 26 respectively of gross accounts receivable in light of the disruptions in global economic markets that began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and has continued through 2010 we have heightened our risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2010 by engaging in a more robust customerbycustomer risk assessment although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

inventory utilization 

 

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market accordingly we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 

 

our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was 383 million at december 31 2010 and 353 million at december 31 2009 which was 102 and 89 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

 

accounting for longlived assets and investments 

 

the ability to realize longlived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount such evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

 

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

goodwill and intangible assets by reporting segment at december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

intangible assets may represent indefinitelived assets eg certain trademarks or brands determinablelived intangibles eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies or goodwill of these only the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles assets primarily trademarks and brand names are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles 

 

considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in our impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

  

impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment the our reporting units are generally its businesses one level below the respective operating segment 

 

goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its carrying value in performing the first step we calculated fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows “dcf” of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of our reporting units were 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the respective industries in which the reporting units operate 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs 4 determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in the current year as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter 2010 impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit for reporting units whose assets include goodwill the compound growth rates during this period range from approximately 4 to 6 for revenue and from approximately 4 to 10 for operating income discount rates were 105 for reporting units in the medical segment and 135 for reporting units in the aerospace and commercial segments a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units 

 

in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit we considered the results of both the dcf and the market comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the average of the results yielded by the two methods for each reporting unit then our current market capitalization was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units plus a control premium to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately 35 which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 

 

no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above the fair values of our reporting units whose assets include goodwill other than the north america reporting unit within the medical segment exceed their respective carrying values by more than 50 for the medical — north america reporting unit the fair value is approximately 12 higher than its carrying value in 2010 where the fair value had been 41 and 18 higher than its carrying value in 2008 and 2009 respectively the approximately 9590 million of goodwill attributed to the medical — north america reporting unit constitutes approximately 66 of our total goodwill 

 

our expected future growth rates are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year which together more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle as a result of this analysis the compound 

annual growth rate of sales and cash flows over the projected ten year period in the medical — north america reporting unit is estimated to be 4 and 6 respectively under the income approach significant changes in assumptions would be required for this reporting unit to fail the step one test for example an increase of over one percent in the discount rate or a decrease of over 30 percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required to indicate impairment for this reporting unit nevertheless while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable and achievable the possibility remains that the core revenue growth of this reporting unit may not perform as expected and as a result the estimated fair value may continue to decline if our strategy andor new products are not successful and we do not achieve core revenue growth in the future the goodwill in the medical — north america reporting unit may become impaired and in such case we may incur material impairment charges 

 

intangible assets 

 

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology customer relationships and trade names the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm’s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method the excess earnings method measures economic benefit of an asset indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to the asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary or contributory assets the residual profit is taxeffected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis or more frequently if necessary in connection with the analysis management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology described above under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 

 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of indefinitelived assets during the fourth quarter of 2010 are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill by segment compound annual growth rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the medical segment ranged from 5 to 9 and a royalty rate of 4 was assumed the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the commercial segment was 5 and a royalty rate of 2 was assumed discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 

 

no impairment in the carrying value of any of our trade names was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above nor would impairment be evident had the fair value of each our indefinitelived assets been hypothetically lower than presently estimated by 10 as of september 27 2010 

 

we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets eg customer relationships instead longlived assets are tested for impairment upon the 

occurrence of a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and reassessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finitelived assets by among other things assessing customer attrition rates 

 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

 

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

 

the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows 

 

 

 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

 

 

 

product warranty liability 

 

we warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products that we will at our option repair or replace without charge such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect warranty periods vary by product we have recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty we accrue for product warranties when based on available information it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold and a reasonable estimate of the costs based on historical claims experience relative to sales can be made our estimated product warranty liability was 109 million and 121 million at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively 

 

distributor rebates 

 

we offer rebates to certain distributors and accrue an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale the estimate is based on an historical experience rate of rebate claims by distributors over the 

previous 12 months for specific product lines the accrual for estimated rebates was 155 million and 135 million at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense is measured using a blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding which is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities which could be material 

 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 495 million and 492 million at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under asc topic 740 “income taxes” which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal 

course of business we are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known specifically we are currently in the midst of examinations by the us canadian german and czech republic taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which could impact our financial results

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances an interest rate swap is used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk the table below provides information regarding the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates shown below are the weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on interest rates in effect on december 31 2010 for the amount subject to swap the notional amount and the related interest rate is shown by year of maturity the fair value net of tax of the interest rate swap as of december 31 2010 was a loss of 154 million which was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 

 

 

 

  

a 10 change in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately 05 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures these are primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar or the euro the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december 31 2010 was a net gain of 01 million the following table provides information regarding our open forward currency contracts as of december 31 2010 which mature in 2011 forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately 76 million 

 

forward currency contracts 

 

 

 

a strengthening of 10 in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would on a combined basis adversely impact the translation of our nonus subsidiary net earnings and transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries by approximately 83 million for the year ended december 31 2011

over the past several years we have engaged in an extensive acquisition and divestiture program to improve margins reduce cyclicality and focus our resources on the development of our healthcare business we have significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses expanding our presence in the medical device industry while divesting many of our businesses serving the aerospace and industrial markets the most significant of these transactions occurred in 2007 with our acquisition of arrow international a leading global supplier of catheterbased medical technology products used for vascular access and cardiac care and the divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses our acquisition of arrow significantly expanded our disposable medical product offerings for critical care enhanced our global footprint and added to our research and development capabilities 

 

we continually evaluate the composition of the portfolio of our products and businesses to ensure alignment with our overall objectives we strive to maintain a portfolio of products and businesses that provide consistency of performance improved profitability and sustainable growth 

 

our business segments 

 

we operate our businesses through three segments the largest of which is our medical segment which represented 77 percent of our consolidated revenues and 91 percent of our segment operating profit in 2009 in 2009 our aerospace and commercial segments represented 10 percent and 13 percent of consolidated revenues respectively and 5 percent and 4 percent of segment operating profit respectively 

 

further detail and additional information regarding our segments and geographic areas is presented in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

  medical 

 

our medical segment designs develops manufactures and supplies medical devices for critical care and surgical applications we categorize our medical products into four product groups critical care surgical cardiac care and oem and development services 

 

approximately 49 percent of our segment revenues are derived from customers outside the united states our medical segment operates 30 manufacturing sites with major manufacturing operations located in czech republic germany malaysia mexico and the united states 

 

the following is an overview of the key product lines within our medical segment 

 

  

critical care which is predominantly comprised of single use products constitutes the largest product category within our medical segment representing 65 percent of segment revenues in 2009 our medical products are used in a wide range of critical care procedures for vascular access respiratory care anesthesia and airway management treatment of urologic conditions and other specialty procedures 

  we are a leading provider of specialty products for critical care our products are generally marketed under the brand names of arrow rüsch hudsonrci gibeck and sheridan the large majority of sales for disposable medical products are made to the hospitalhealthcare provider market with a smaller percentage sold to alternate sites 

 

  

our vascular access products are generally catheterbased products used in a variety of clinical procedures to facilitate multiple critical care therapies including the administration of intravenous medications other therapies and the measurement of blood pressure and taking of blood samples through a single puncture site 

 

our vascular access catheters and related devices consist principally of central venous access catheters such as the following the arrowhowe’s multilumen catheter a catheter equipped with three or four channels or lumens doubleand singlelumen catheters which are designed for use in a variety of clinical procedures the arrow pressure injectable cvc which gives clinicians who perform contrastenhanced ct scans the option of using an indwelling pressure injectable arrow cvc without having to insert another catheter for their scan and percutaneous sheath introducers which are used as a means for inserting cardiovascular and other catheterization devices into the vascular system during critical care procedures 

 

we also provide a range of peripherally inserted central catheters which are soft flexible catheters inserted in the upper arm and advanced into the superior vena cava and are accessed for various types of intravenous medications and therapies and radial artery catheters which are used for measuring arterial blood pressure and taking blood samples our offerings include a pressure injectable peripherally inserted catheter which addresses the therapeutic need for a catheter that can withstand the higher pressures required by the injection of contrast media for ct scans 

 

our vascular access products also include specialty catheters and related products used in a range of other procedures and include percutaneous thrombolytic devices which are designed for clearance of thrombosed hemodialysis grafts in chronic hemodialysis patients and hemodialysis access catheters including the cannon ® catheter which is used to facilitate dialysis treatment 

 

many of our vascular access catheters are treated with the arrowgard or arrowgard blue plus antiseptic surface treatments to reduce the risk of catheter related infection arrowgard blue plus is a newer longer lasting formulation of arrowgard and provides antimicrobial treatment of the interior lumens and hubs of each catheter 

 

as part of our ongoing efforts to meet physicians’ needs for safety and management of risk of infection in the hospital setting we sell a maximal barrier precautions central venous access kit which includes a full body drape a catheter treated with the arrowgard antimicrobial technology and other accessories the features of this kit were created to assist healthcare providers in complying with guidelines for reducing catheterrelated bloodstream infections that have been established by a variety of health regulatory agencies such as the centers for disease control and prevention and the joint commission on the accreditation of healthcare organizations 

 

related products include custom tubing sets used to connect central venous catheters to blood pressure monitoring devices and drug infusion systems 

 

during 2009 we introduced the arrow pressure injectable triple lumen picc with a nontapered catheter body and the arrow blueflextip designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis and infection associated with venous access catheters we introduced a new tray design and additional features for our kits containing our arrow pressure injectable cvc and a cvc kit designed specifically for the needs of the japanese market 

    

our respiratory care products principally consist of devices used in aerosol and medication delivery oxygen therapy and ventilation management we offer an extensive range of aerosol therapy products including the micromist nebulizer the nebumask system and the optineb pro compressor we are also a global provider of oxygen supplies offering a broad range of products to deliver oxygen therapy safely and comfortably these include masks cannulas tubing and humidifiers these products are used in a variety of clinical settings including hospitals longterm care facilities rehabilitation centers and patients’ homes to treat respiratory ailments such as chronic lung disease pneumonia cystic fibrosis and asthma 

 

our ventilation management products promote patient safety and maximize clinician efficiency these products include ventilator circuits with an extended life to support clinical practice guidelines high efficiency particulate air hepa filters that provide protection against the transmission of bacteria and viruses heat and moisture exchangers that reduce circuit manipulation and crosscontamination risk and heated humidifiers that promote patient compliance to noninvasive respiratory strategies like noninvasive ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy 

 

our conchatherm neptune is a heated humidification solution it is designed to enable the caregiver to customize patient treatment to meet specific clinical goals and to facilitate advanced patient outcomes without sacrificing clinician efficiency 

 

during 2009 we introduced the gibeck humidflo heat and moisture exchanger which allows medication to be delivered without breaking the breathing circuit or interrupting ventilation and osmo a product that allows for maintenance free water removal from the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit during mechanical ventilation breathing systems used to deliver medical gases from a ventilator to a patient’s lungs in 2009 we also signed an agreement to act as an exclusive distributor of the resmed noninvasive ventilation mask portfolio for specified acute care hospitals in the united states 

 

  

our anesthesia and airway management products include endotracheal tubes laryngeal masks airways and face masks to deliver anesthetic agents and oxygen to assist in the placement of endotracheal tubes we provide a comprehensive and unique line of laryngoscope blades and handles including standard halogen and fiber optic light sources 

 

our regional anesthesia or acute pain management products include epidural spinal and peripheral nerve block catheters nerve blocks provide pain relief during and after surgical procedures and help clinicians better manage each patient’s pain we offer the first stimulating continuous nerve block catheter the arrow stimucath which confirms the positive placement of the catheter next to the nerve the flex tip plus continuous epidural catheter features a soft flexible tip that helps reduce the incidence of complications such as transient paresthesia and inadvertent cannulation of blood vessels or the dura while improving the clinician’s ability to thread the catheter into the epidural space our arrow theracath epidural catheter with high compression strength for directionability and enhanced radiopacity was designed for pain management procedures where increased steerability is important additional integral components create a range of standard and custom procedural kits 

 

during 2009 we introduced a new line of laryngeal masks added a line of disposable metal laryngoscope blades to our line of laryngoscope products and extended our endotracheal tube product line we also expanded our range of products for acute pain management with the introduction of new spinal kits marketed under the arrow sureblock spinal brand 

    

our line of urology products provides bladder management for patients in the hospital and home care markets our product portfolio consists principally of catheters including foley intermittent external and suprapubic urine collectors catheterization accessories and products for operative endurology we believe we have significant market share in foley catheters in the emea markets europe the middle east and africa 

 

we also design our urine collectors catheterization accessories and kits with our overall infection prevention strategy in mind for example the rüsch mmg closed system intermittent catheter is used by spinal cord injury patients to help reduce the likelihood of urinary tract infections 

 

in the united states reimbursement regulations were implemented in 2009 that allow many medicare patients to shift from a reuseable practice with its inherent risk of infections to a single use disposable practice sales of our intermittent catheters in the us have benefited from this reimbursement shift 

 

during 2009 we introduced new intermittent catheters with hydrophilic coatings a new profile urinary foley catheter and a silicone postoperative foley catheter all marketed under the rüsch brand

competition 

 

  medical segment 

 

the medical devices industry is highly competitive we compete with many companies ranging from small startup enterprises to companies that are larger and more established than us with access to significant financial resources furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the market in which we compete we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies for our medical segment businesses to remain competitive we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product reliability performance customer and sales support and costeffectiveness 

 

  aerospace and commercial segments 

 

the businesses within our aerospace and commercial segments generally face significant competition from competitors of varying sizes we believe that our competitive position depends on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineering personnel the knowhow and skill of our manufacturing personnel and the strength and scope of our sales service and distribution networks competitors of the businesses with our aerospace segment include goodrich corporation aar corp and driessen aerospace group competition for our commercial business tends to be fragmented 

 

sales and marketing 

 

  medical segment 

 

our medical products are sold directly to hospitals healthcare providers distributors and to original equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales forces and through independent representatives and independent distributor networks 

 

  aerospace and commercial segments 

 

products sold to the aerospace market are sold through our own field representatives and distributors the majority of our commercial segment products are sold through a direct sales force of field representatives and technical specialists marine driver controls and engine and drive parts are sold directly to boat builders and engine manufacturers as well as through distributors dealers and retail outlets to reach recreational boaters rigging products and services includes both a retail business and a wholesale business both of which sell through a direct sales force 

 

backlog 

 

  medical segment 

 

most of our medical products are sold to hospitals or healthcare providers on orders calling for delivery within a few days or weeks with longer order times for products sold to medical device manufacturers therefore the backlog of our medical segment orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any future 12month period 

    aerospace segment 

 

as of december 31 2009 our backlog of firm orders for our aerospace segment was 45 million of which we expect approximately 95 percent to be filled in 2010 our backlog for our aerospace segment on december 31 2008 was 68 million 

 

  commercial segment 

 

standard commercial segment products are typically shipped between a few days and three months after receipt of order therefore the backlog of such orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any future 12month period 

 

patents and trademarks 

 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex and arrow brands to be essential to the operation of our business 

 

suppliers and materials 

 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we cannot be assured of successfully passing these cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

 

research and development 

 

we are engaged in both internal and external research and development in our medical aerospace and commercial segments nearly 80 of our research and development costs occur in our medical business in connection with our efforts to bring innovative new products to the markets we serve and to enhance the clinical value ease of use safety and reliability of our existing product lines our research and development efforts support our strategic objectives to provide safe and effective products that reduce infections improve patient and clinician safety enhance patient outcomes and enable less invasive procedures 

 

research and development in our aerospace and commercial businesses is focused on the development of lighter more durable and more automated systems and products that facilitate cargo loading and containment on commercial aircraft and improve the performance of recreational boats 

 

we also acquire or license products and technologies that are consistent with our strategic objectives and enhance our ability to provide a full range of product and service options to our customers 

 

seasonality 

 

portions of our revenues particularly in the commercial and medical segments are subject to seasonal fluctuations revenues in the marine aftermarket generally increase in the second quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming season incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to disposable medical products 

  employees 

 

we employed approximately 12700 fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2009 of these employees approximately 3900 were employed in the united states and 8800 in countries outside of the united states less than 8 percent of our employees in the united states were covered by union contracts we have governmentmandated collectivebargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover employees in other countries we believe we have good relationships with our employees

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

we are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

we face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government health care reform 

 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry to fundamental changes we anticipate that the current presidential administration congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of reducing health care costs and expanding access the uncertainties regarding the final legislation and its implementation could continue to have an adverse effect on our customers’ purchasing decisions regarding our products and services any legislation enacted could represent opportunities and challenges the potential exists that medicare and medicaid reimbursement in a variety of health care settings could be negatively impacted additionally proposals to tax the sale of medical device technologies are being considered in congress at this juncture in the legislative process it is not possible to determine the final magnitude of the tax or its precise structure and implementation however should a medical device manufacturers’ tax be enacted into law its impact along with the impact of health care reform to medicare and medicaid reimbursement as well as other aspects of the various reform plans to our industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow at this time we cannot predict with certainty which if any health care reform proposals will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

 

customers in our medical segment depend on third party reimbursement and the failure of healthcare programs to provide reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect our medical segment 

 

demand for some of our medical products is affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business internationally medical reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the level of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for some of our medical products could be adversely affected 

 

we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of reimbursement could harm our business in addition as a result of their purchasing power third party payors often seek discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers our provision of such pricing concessions could negatively impact our revenues and product margins 

 

much of our business is subject to extensive government regulation which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

numerous national and local government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products the us food and drug administration “fda” and government agencies in other countries regulate the approval manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our medical products the us federal aviation administration and the european aviation safety agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some of our aerospace products and licenses for the operation of our repair stations failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing shutdowns product shortages delays in product manufacturing product seizures recalls operating restrictions withdrawal of required licenses prohibitions against exporting of products to or importing products from countries outside the united states in addition civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare could result from regulatory 

  violations any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all the regulatory approval process may result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our medical segment facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal state and foreign governmental authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures 

 

on october 11 2007 arrow international received a corporate warning letter from the fda which expresses concerns with arrow’s quality systems including complaint handling corrective and preventive action process and design validation and inspection and training procedures while we are working with the fda to resolve these issues our efforts to address the issues raised in the warning letter have required and may continue to require the dedication of significant internal and external resources there can be no assurance regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the fda in addition if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda we may need to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts and the fda may take further regulatory actions against us these actions may include seizing our product inventory obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree on us which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs 

 

in addition we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 

  

these laws and government regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover we may become subject to additional environmental claims which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup based on our past present or future business activities which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our strategic initiatives may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income 

 

we have disclosed operational strategies and initiatives these strategies include making significant investments to achieve revenue growth and margin improvement targets if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting and our results of operations may be adversely affected in addition as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our 

  strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions and may experience business disruptions associated with announced restructuring realignment and cost reduction activities 

 

over the past few years we have announced several restructuring realignment and cost reduction initiatives including significant realignments of our businesses employee terminations and product rationalizations while we have started to realize the efficiencies of these actions these activities may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits we expect further such benefits may be realized later than expected and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated if these measures are not successful or sustainable we may undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts which could result in future charges moreover our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected and we could experience business disruptions with customers and elsewhere if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective 

 

our failure to successfully develop new products could adversely affect our results 

 

the medical device industry is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances in addition while our products for the aerospace and commercial industries generally have longer life cycles many of those products require changes in design or other enhancements to meet the evolving needs of our customers the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products our product development efforts may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as the inability to 

 

  

moreover we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products could reduce our revenues and margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability warranty recall and other claims that may be brought against us 

 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients many of these products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time and component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of the patient in addition our products for the 

  aerospace and commercial industries are used in potentially hazardous environments although we carry product liability insurance we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage accordingly we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety and we may experience lost sales and be exposed to legal and reputational risk product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of litigation including regulatory matters is often difficult to predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we have substantial debt obligations that could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

as of december 31 2009 our outstanding indebtedness was approximately 12 billion we will be required to use a significant portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our indebtedness over the next few years as a result cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and dividends may be limited our indebtedness may also subject us to greater vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 

 

our senior credit facility and agreements with the holders of our senior notes which we refer to below as our senior debt facilities impose certain operating and financial covenants that could limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

in addition the terms of our senior debt facilities require us to comply with a number of covenants including covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios which are described in more detail in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure that in the event of a significant deterioration of our operating results we will be able to satisfy those ratios a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior debt facilities if we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders under the senior debt facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior debt facilities to be immediately due and payable and 

  terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the facilities if the lenders under the senior debt facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings and we are not able to obtain financing to enable repayment we likely would have to liquidate significant assets which nevertheless may not be sufficient to repay our borrowings 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

 

although no material concentration of our manufacturing operations exists in any single country we have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states including operations conducted through entities that are not whollyowned as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 41 of our total fixed assets and 46 of our total net revenues were attributable to products directly distributed from our operations outside the us our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including 

 

  

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenue from products manufactured in and sold into nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our us dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows denominated in nonfunctional currency in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

 

many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities including copper and zinc although we monitor our exposure to these commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall risk management program volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

  fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect our results 

 

as a company with significant operations outside of the us we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions as a result our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in preparing our financial statements we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition unfavorable results of tax audits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate among other things could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

an interruption in our manufacturing operations may adversely affect our business 

 

many of our key products across all three of our business segments are manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities if an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of our facilities it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all in addition with respect to our medical segment due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components that are acceptable to us could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

further adverse developments in general domestic and global economic conditions combined with a continuation of volatile global credit markets could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

 

we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions including recession or economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets the credit and capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption over the past year leading to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending these recessionary conditions have caused customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services while recent indicators suggest modest improvement in the united states and global economy we cannot predict the timing or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more normalized spending behaviors if the recessionary conditions continue or worsen our customers may terminate existing purchase orders or reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us in the future adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts receivable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us these types of actions by our suppliers could significantly affect our liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial market conditions we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

 

in addition the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet have increased significantly in recent years primarily as a result of the acquisition of arrow international in 2007 adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of our intellectual property rights is important though not essential to the future success of our business in addition to relying on our patents trademarks and copyrights we rely on confidentiality agreements with employees and other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than ours or that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach confidentiality agreements misappropriate proprietary information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive harm that could adversely affect our business 

 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

 

the research and development of some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and the development of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and as public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge advice and input our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of services 

 

approximately 13 of our net revenues are generated by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

on october 11 2007 the company’s subsidiary arrow international inc “arrow” received a corporate warning letter from the us food and drug administration fda the letter cited three sitespecific warning letters issued by the fda in 2005 and subsequent inspections performed from june 2005 to february 2007 at arrow’s facilities in the united states the letter expressed concerns with arrow’s quality systems including complaint handling corrective and preventive action process and design validation inspection and training procedures it also advised that arrow’s corporatewide program to evaluate correct and prevent quality system issues has been deficient limitations on premarket approvals and certificates for foreign governments had 

  previously been imposed on arrow based on prior inspections and the corporate warning letter did not impose additional sanctions that are expected to have a material financial impact on the company 

 

in connection with its acquisition of arrow completed on october 1 2007 the company developed an integration plan that included the commitment of significant resources to correct these previouslyidentified regulatory issues and further improve overall quality systems senior management officials from the company have met with fda representatives and a comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented to fda in late 2007 at the end of 2009 the fda began its reinspections of the arrow facilities covered by the corporate warning letter these inspections have been substantially completed and the fda has issued certain written observations to arrow as a result of those inspections we are currently in the process of responding to those observations and communicating with the fda regarding resolution of all outstanding issues 

 

while the company continues to believe it has substantially remediated these issues through the corrective actions taken to date there can be no assurances that these issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of the fda if the company’s remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda the company may have to devote additional financial and human resources to its efforts and the fda may take further regulatory actions against the company 

 

in addition we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability intellectual property employment and environmental matters based on information currently available advice of counsel established reserves and other resources we do not believe that any such actions are likely to be individually or in the aggregate material to our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity however in the event of unexpected further developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters or other similar matters if unfavorable may be materially adverse to our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

teleflex strives to maintain a portfolio of businesses that provide consistency of performance improved profitability and sustainable growth we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through our internal growth initiatives which include the development of new products expansion of market share moving existing products into new geographies and through selected acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development initiatives and our ability to grow market share 

 

over the past several years we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions principally in our medical segment and divestitures in both our aerospace and commercial segments these portfolio actions resulted in a significant expansion of our medical segment operations and a significant reduction in our aerospace and commercial segment operations as a result our medical segment now accounts for over 75 of our revenues from continuing operations and over 90 of our segment operating profit the following bullet points summarize our more significant acquisitions and divestitures which occurred in 2007 and 2009 the results for the acquired businesses are included in the respective segments see notes 3 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our significant acquisitions and divestitures 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 27 

   

  

we incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the consideration for our october 2007 acquisition of arrow as of december 31 2009 our outstanding indebtedness was approximately 12 billion down from 15 billion as of december 31 2008 primarily due to the use of 240 million of the proceeds from the sale of the ati businesses to repay and reduce indebtedness for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see “liquidity and capital resources” below and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

the global recessionary conditions that prevailed throughout 2009 have had an adverse impact on market activities including among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity and reduced demand for products and services at teleflex these economic developments principally affected our aerospace and commercial segments during 2009 and in response we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities although on a consolidated basis the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity during 2009 the continuation of the broad economic trends could adversely affect our operations in the future as described below the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below under “liquidity and capital resources” in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

  

hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions a weaker payor mix and a reduction in elective procedures hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs including limiting their capital spending and distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels during 2009 the impact of these actions were most pronounced in capital goods markets which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses and in the orthopedic sector which impacted our orthopedic oem business approximately 80 percent of our medical revenues come from disposable products used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers 

 

although the impact of the global recession outside the united states has been less pronounced to date funding for foreign healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact versions of healthcare reform to lower overall healthcare costs during 2009 the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe most notably greece spain portugal and italy have experienced reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions which has resulted in a slow down in payments to us we believe this situation will be with us until these countries are able to find alternative funding sources to their respective public healthcare sectors in 2009 sales into the public hospital systems in these countries were approximately 4 of our total sales 

 

distributors in certain asian markets were negatively impacted by credit availability and large swings in currency values early in 2009 but returned to more normal order patterns later in the year 

  significant fundamental changes are currently being proposed to the healthcare system in the us the us house of representatives and senate passed versions of health care reform legislation late in 2009 the bills in their current form contain provisions that i mandate health insurance coverage ii introduce various insurance market reforms and iii seek to finance the cost of health care reform by reductions in medicare and medicaid reimbursement and the levy of a variety of payroll taxes and fees on individuals and employers including the imposition of fees on medical device manufacturers such as teleflex the potential impact of these reforms remains uncertain the addition of significant numbers of currently uninsured patients into the healthcare system could spur additional volume demand for our products however reductions in medicare and medicaid reimbursement could negatively affect pricing we continue to study the evolution of the house and senate bills but until legislation is passed in final form we will be unable to ascertain the anticipated impact on teleflex 

 

  

results of operations 

 

discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelvemonth period 

  the following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations of the ati businesses power systems tamg and the gms businesses which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and “discontinued operations” in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for discussion of discontinued operations 

 

  revenues 

 

 

 

net revenues decreased approximately 9 to 189 billion in 2009 from 207 billion in 2008 reduced revenues from core business caused 6 of the decline while foreign currency movements caused the other 3 of the decline as a result of 2 core growth in the fourth quarter in the medical segment core revenue in that segment was flat in 2009 compared to 2008 but core revenue declined in the aerospace and commercial segments 24 and 17 respectively in 2009 compared to 2008 weak global economic conditions have negatively impacted markets served by our aerospace and commercial segments throughout 2009 

 

net revenues increased approximately 31 to 207 billion in 2008 from 158 billion in 2007 businesses acquired in 2008 accounted for almost all of this increase in revenues as foreign currency translation contributed 1 to revenue growth while revenues from core business were essentially unchanged compared to 2007 core revenue growth in the medical 2 and aerospace 1 segments was offset by a 9 decline in core revenues in the commercial segment which was primarily due to a significant decrease in sales of recreational marine products 

 

  gross profit 

 

 

 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 431 in 2009 from 414 in 2008 with all three segments experiencing increases in gross profit as a percentage of revenues the principal factors that impact the overall increase were a higher percentage of medical revenues 77 of total revenues in 2009 compared to 73 in 2008 a 7 million fair value adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of 2008 related to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which did not recur in 2009 synergies from the arrow acquisition and manufacturing cost reductions implemented in each of our three segments partly offset by higher pension expense in 2009 because of the decline in the value of our pension assets at the end of 2008 as a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets 

 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 414 in 2008 from 376 in 2007 this trend was driven by increases in the medical and aerospace segments as the gross profit percentage in the commercial segment was unchanged from 2007 improved margins in the medical segment were largely due to the inclusion of higher margin arrow critical care product lines for the full year in 2008 compared to only the fourth quarter in 2007 and volume related manufacturing efficiencies in the medical oem product line improved margins in the aerospace segment were principally due to a shift in sales favoring engine repair services and away from sales of lower margin replacement parts in the engine repairs business 

    selling engineering and administrative 

 

 

 

selling engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 275 in 2009 compared to 272 in 2008 the increase in the amount as a percentage of revenues is due to the yearonyear decline in revenues the reduction in the dollar value of these costs was principally the result of cost reduction initiatives throughout the company including restructuring and integration activities in connection with the arrow acquisition and the 2008 commercial segment restructuring program and lower spending on remediation of fda regulatory issues these factors resulted in an aggregate reduction in expenses of approximately 45 million 

 

selling engineering and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 272 in 2008 compared to 259 in 2007 principally due to approximately 25 million higher amortization expense related to the arrow acquisition and approximately 20 million higher expenses in the medical segment related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues 

 

  goodwill impairment and inprocess rd charge 

 

 

 

in 2009 we performed an interim review of goodwill for our cargo container reporting unit during the second quarter as a result of the difficult market conditions confronting the cargo container reporting unit and the significant deterioration in its operating performance which accelerated in the second quarter of 2009 upon conclusion of this review we determined that goodwill in the cargo container operations was impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 67 million in the second quarter of 2009 

 

in 2007 we recorded a 24 million goodwill impairment charge related to a writedown to the agreed selling price of one of our variable interest entities in the commercial segment 

 

the 300 million writeoff of inprocess research and development costs in 2007 is related to inprocess rd projects acquired in the arrow acquisition which we determined had no alternative future use in their current state 

 

  interest income and expense 

 

 

 

interest expense decreased in 2009 due to an approximate 350 million reduction in debt during the year principally reflecting the 240 million of debt repaid in the first quarter of 2009 from the proceeds of the sale of the ati business 

 

interest expense increased significantly in 2008 compared to 2007 principally as a result of the full year impact of the debt incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition in october 2007 interest income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to lower amounts of invested funds combined with lower average interest rates 

    taxes on income from continuing operations 

 

 

 

the effective tax rate in 2009 was 218 compared to 326 in 2008 taxes on income from continuing operations in 2009 were 399 million compared to 475 million in 2008 the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to i a decrease in deferred state tax liabilities driven by changes to applicable state tax laws and ii a reduction in the current year for reserves for uncertain tax positions as audits and settlements were closed and fewer new reserves were established than in the prior year 

 

the effective tax rate in 2008 was 326 compared to 1404 in 2007 taxes on income from continuing operations of 1099 million in 2007 include discrete income tax charges incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition specifically in connection with funding the acquisition of arrow the company i repatriated approximately 1970 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries which had previously been deemed to be permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions and ii changed its position with respect to certain additional previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these earnings as no longer permanently reinvested these items resulted in a discrete income tax charge in 2007 of approximately 809 million the company did not incur similar charges in 2009 or 2008 

 

  restructuring and other impairment charges 

 

 

 

in december 2008 we began certain restructuring initiatives that affect the commercial segment these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at three of our facilities in europe and north america we implemented these initiatives as a means to address an expected continuation of weakness in the marine and industrial markets these costs amounted to approximately 22 million during 2009 as of december 31 2009 we have completed the 2008 commercial segment restructuring program we expect to have realized annual pretax savings of between 35  45 million in 2010 as a result of actions taken in connection with this program 

 

in connection with the acquisition of arrow during 2007 we formulated a plan related to the integration of arrow and our other medical businesses the integration plan focused on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing sales marketing and distribution functions in north america europe and asia costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of arrow have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of teleflex are charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations these costs amounted to approximately 70 million during 2009 as of december 31 2009 we estimate that the aggregate of future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the arrow integration plan are approximately 13 — 23 million in 2010 of this amount 10 — 15 million relates to employee termination costs 02 — 05 million relates to contract termination costs associated with the termination of leases and certain distribution agreements and 01 — 03 million relates to other restructuring costs we also have incurred restructuring related costs in the medical segment which do not qualify for classification as restructuring costs in 2009 these costs amounted to 

  25 million and are reported in the medical segment’s operating results in materials labor and other product costs and in selling engineering and administrative expenses we expect to have realized annual pretax savings of between 7075 million by the end of 2010 when these integration and restructuring actions are complete 

 

in june 2006 we began certain restructuring initiatives that affected all three of our operating segments these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america we took these initiatives as a means to improving operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources and these activities are now complete 

 

for additional information regarding our restructuring programs see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

during the second quarter of 2009 we recorded 23 million in impairment charges with respect to an intangible asset in our commercial segment during the third quarter of 2009 we recorded a 33 million impairment charge related to our investment in a california real estate venture in 2004 we contributed property and other assets that had been part of one of our former manufacturing sites to the real estate venture during the third quarter of 2009 based on continued deterioration in the california real estate market we concluded that our investment was not recoverable and recorded the impairment charge to fully writeoff our investment in this venture 

 

impairment charges in 2008 included 27 million related to five of our minority held investments precipitated by the deteriorating economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 08 million related to an intangible asset in the commercial segment that was identified during the annual impairment testing process and a 02 million reduction in the carrying value of a building held for sale in 2007 we determined that two minorityheld investments and a building held for sale were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of 39 million 

 

segment review 

 

 

  the percentage increases or decreases in revenues during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 compared to the respective prior years were due to the following factors 

 

 

 

the following is a discussion of our segment operating results additional information regarding our segments including a reconciliation of segment operating profit to income from continuing operations before interest taxes and minority interest is presented in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

medical 

 

  

medical segment net revenues declined 3 in 2009 to 14571 million from 14991 million in 2008 entirely due to foreign currency fluctuations mainly the stronger us dollar against the euro during the first three quarters of 2009 in the aggregate we experienced no growth in core revenue in 2009 over 2008 as growth in critical care products in europe and asialatin america of approximately 11 million was offset by approximately 9 million lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation products to oems in north america and approximately 8 million lower sales of surgical products in north america and europe 

 

net sales for 2009 2008 and 2007 by product group for the medical segment are comprised of the following 

 

 

 

  

the decrease in critical care product sales during 2009 compared to 2008 was entirely due to currency fluctuations as core revenue in this product group increased approximately 1 in 2009 higher sales of vascular access urology and anesthesia products of approximately 12 million were partially offset by approximately 6 million lower sales of respiratory products principally as a result of distributor destocking in north america in early 2009 

    

surgical product sales declined approximately 4 in 2009 compared to 2008 foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by approximately 3 and lower sales in the instrumentation product line in europe and north america led the 1 decline in core revenue we believe this decline in sales resulted from hospitals limiting their capital budgets for these products and distributors reducing inventory in the supply chain 

 

  

the decrease in sales of cardiac care products in 2009 compared to 2008 is mainly due to currency movements hospital capital budget constraints and a voluntary product recall during the first quarter of 2009 

 

  

sales of devices to oems decreased primarily as a result of approximately 9 million lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation as higher sales of specialty sutures and other devices of approximately 2 million was offset by the impact of currency movements a reduction in new product launches by oem customers and overall weakness in oem orthopedic markets due to hospital budgetary constraints and postponement of certain elective surgical procedures have had a negative impact on demand for our orthopedic instrumentation products 

 

operating profit in the medical segment increased 7 in 2009 to 3051 million from 2863 million in 2008 the negative impact on operating profit from a stronger us dollar during the first three quarters of 2009 was more than offset by approximately 20 million of lower manufacturing and selling general and administrative costs during 2009 as a result of cost reduction initiatives including restructuring and integration activities in connection with the arrow acquisition and approximately 18 million lower expenses related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues also a 7 million expense for fair value adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of 2008 related to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which did not recur in 2009 had a favorable impact on the comparison of 2009 operating profit to the prior year 

 

during the first quarter 2010 we undertook a voluntary recall of our custom iv tubing product estimated costs to be incurred for the recall are in a range of approximately 45 million to 75 million pretax of that amount 17 million relates to units sold or produced in 2009 and is included in materials labor and other product costs in the 2009 consolidated statement of income 

 

  

medical segment net revenues grew 44 in 2008 to 14991 million from 10413 million in 2007 the acquisition of arrow accounted for 40 of this increase in revenues of the remaining 4 increase in net revenues 2 was due to foreign currency fluctuations and 2 was due to core revenue growth medical segment core revenue growth in 2008 reflects higher sales volume for critical care and surgical products in europe and asialatin america of approximately 13 million and 8 million respectively and a 17 million increase in sales of specialty medical devices to oems partially offset by 23 million lower sales volumes for critical care and surgical products in north america 

 

operating profit in the medical segment increased 57 in 2008 to 2863 million from 1826 million in 2007 principally due to the addition of higher margin arrow critical care product lines other factors that contributed to the higher operating profit were improved cost and operational efficiencies in north america higher volumes in europe and asialatin america lower fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition 7 million in 2008 versus 29 million in 2007 and the favorable impact from the stronger euro the impact of these factors was partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 million higher amortization expense related to the arrow acquisition and 20 million in higher costs incurred in 2008 in connection with a plan to remediate fda regulatory issues 

  aerospace 

 

  

aerospace segment net revenues declined 27 in 2009 to 1851 million from 2538 million in 2008 core revenue reductions accounted for nearly all 24 of the decline in revenue weakness in the commercial aviation sector throughout 2009 resulted in reduced sales to commercial airlines and freight carriers of wide body cargo spare components and repairs cargo containers and actuators this market weakness has also reduced the number of aftermarket cargo system conversions resulting in lower sales of multideck wide body cargo handling systems which offset the impact of higher sales of single deck wide body systems on passenger aircraft 

 

segment operating profit decreased 41 in 2009 to 154 million from 261 million in 2008 this decline was principally due to the sharply lower sales volumes across all product lines including the unfavorable mix in 2009 of lower margin single deck system sales compared with a mix in 2008 that was weighted more toward aftermarket multideck system conversions and spares and repairs the impact from lower sales volumes was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives that resulted in operating cost reductions of approximately 9 million during 2009 

 

  

aerospace segment net revenues grew 28 in 2008 to 2538 million from 1978 million in 2007 the expansion of the cargo containers product line due to the acquisition of nordisk aviation products accounted for 24 of this increase the 1 increase in core growth is primarily attributable to increased sales of narrow body cargo loading systems and wide body and narrow body cargo spare components and repairs 

 

segment operating profit increased 43 in 2008 to 261 million from 183 million in 2007 the increase was principally due to the impact of the nordisk acquisition and favorable product mix of repair versus replacement in the engine repair services business as a result of technology investments we have made consolidation of operations and phasing out of lower margin product lines in the engine repair services business during 2007 also had a positive impact on operating profit in 2008 

 

commercial 

 

  

commercial segment net revenues declined approximately 21 in 2009 to 2479 million from 3138 million in 2008 core revenue reductions accounted for 17 of the decline which was principally the result of a decrease in demand for rigging services 7 and a decline in sales of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market 15 partially offset by approximately 20 million of higher sales of the modern burner unit to the us military 

 

in 2009 segment operating profit decreased 42 to 152 million compared to 261 million in 2008 this decrease was principally due to the lower sales volumes of rigging products and marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market and sale of higher cost inventory in the rigging services business which more than offset the impact from the elimination of approximately 8 million of operating costs in 2009 and higher sales of the modern burner unit to the us military 

 

  

commercial segment net revenues declined approximately 7 in 2008 to 3138 million from 3360 million in 2007 core revenue declined 9 as a result of a 12 decline in sales of marine products for the recreational boat market offset by a 3 increase in sales of rigging services products extreme volatility in fuel costs accompanied by deterioration in the general state of the global economy in the second half of 2008 adversely impacted the markets served by our marine products 

  in 2008 segment operating profit decreased 19 to 261 million compared to 320 million in 2007 this decrease was principally due to a lower operating profit in the marine business resulting from lower sales in 2008 and unfavorable currency impact of approximately 3 million partially offset by an increase in the rigging services business due to an acquisition during 2007 

 

discontinued operations 

 

during the third quarter of 2009 we completed the sale of our power systems operations to fuel systems solutions inc for 145 million and realized a loss of 33 million net of tax during the second quarter we recognized a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 251 million to adjust the carrying value of these operations to their estimated fair value in the third quarter of 2009 we reported the power systems operations including the goodwill impairment charge in discontinued operations 

 

on march 20 2009 we completed the sale of our 51 percent ownership interest in ati singapore to ge pacific private limited for 300 million in cash ati singapore which provides engine repair products and services for critical components of flight turbines was part of a joint venture between general electric company “ge” and us in december 2009 we completed the transfer of our ownership interest in the remaining ati business together with ati singapore the “ati businesses” to ge for a nominal amount 

 

at the end of 2007 we completed the sale of our gms businesses to kongsberg automotive holding asa for 560 million in cash in the second quarter of 2008 we refined our estimates for the postclosing adjustments based on the provisions of the purchase agreement with kongsberg automotive holdings on the sale of the gms businesses also during 2008 we recorded a charge for the settlement of a contingency related to the sale of the gms businesses these activities resulted in a decrease in the gain on sale of the gms businesses and are reported in discontinued operations as a loss of 142 million net of taxes of 60 million 

 

on june 29 2007 we completed the sale of a precisionmachined components business in our aerospace segment for approximately 134 million in cash 

 

the company has reported results of operations cash flows and gains losses on the disposition of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding divestiture activity and accounting for discontinued operations 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends common stock repurchases adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to other capital markets 

 

the global recessionary conditions that persisted throughout 2009 affected the operating results of our various businesses as described above in “results of operations” nevertheless we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund additional operating needs however in light of current economic conditions there is an increased risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity if current market conditions deteriorate further we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our customers’ purchases from us which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

 

the precipitous deterioration in the securities markets that occurred during 2008 and the subsequent moderate recovery in these markets during 2009 has impacted the market value of the assets included in our defined benefit pension plans as a result of these market conditions the market value of assets in our domestic 

  pension funds declined in value by approximately 76 million or 29 during 2008 and recovered approximately 37 million or 22 in 2009 these events did not have a significant impact on our pension funding requirements in 2009 nor do we expect a significant impact on 2010 funding requirements because amounts funded to the plans in prior years exceeded the minimum amounts required in those years the volatility in the securities markets has not significantly affected the liquidity of our pension plans or counterparty exposure a majority of our domestic pension plans are invested in mutual funds registered with the sec under the investment company act of 1940 underlying holdings of the mutual funds are primarily invested in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities 

 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective basis the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and will continue to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so during 2009 we repatriated approximately 363 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries and we expect to access approximately 70 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries in 2010 to help fund debt service and other cash requirements substantially all of our debt service requirements are united states based and we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of these requirements during 2009 we repaid approximately 359 million of debt from the proceeds of the sale of businesses and from cash generated from operations as a result we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until september 2011 our next scheduled senior note principal payment is in july 2011 for 145 million we anticipate our domestic interest payments for 2010 will be approximately 69 million to the extent we cannot or choose not to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements our revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner 

 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our revolving credit facility and additional sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations 

 

a summary of our cash flows for the last three years is as follows 

 

 

 

cash flow from operating activities 

 

lower tax payments of approximately 25 million lower interest payments of approximately 25 million and approximately 16 million greater reduction in working capital were the primary contributors to the higher cash flow from operations in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately 101 million during 2009 which was comprised of a reduction in taxes of approximately 121 million offset by the impact from a reduction of working capital of approximately 20 million the 

  reduction in taxes includes 975 million of taxes paid in connection with businesses divested in 2009 the reduction in working capital results principally from i lower accounts receivable primarily in the commercial and aerospace segments generally reflecting lower sales partly offset by higher receivables in the medical segment due to a slow down in payments from public hospitals in italy spain portugal and greece where funding has been under pressure due to weak economic conditions ii lower inventory due largely to efforts in both the aerospace and commercial segments in response to weak demand during 2009 generally coupled with deliveries of cargo handling systems in the aerospace segment whose delivery schedules had been delayed from 2008 into 2009 partly offset by iii lower accounts payable and accrued expenses largely due to reduced spending on inventory in the aerospace and commercial segments coupled with payments of termination benefits and contract termination costs in restructuring and integration reserves 

 

higher tax payments of approximately 112 million net of refunds of approximately 27 million and higher interest payments of approximately 60 million were the principal factors in the yearonyear decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 the largest factor contributing to the higher tax payments is approximately 90 million of taxes paid in connection with businesses divested in 2007 

 

changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately 104 million during 2008 which is principally attributable to the 90 million of tax payments mentioned previously the cash flow impact from changes in other operating assets and liabilities offset one another an inventory increase of approximately 14 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 3 million decrease in accounts receivable of 11 million and a decrease in other operating assets of 4 million the ramp up in production of cargo handling systems to meet the delivery schedules communicated earlier in the year from aircraft manufacturers and the late in the year delay of those delivery schedules into 2009 was the principal 14 million cause of the yearonyear increase in inventory nearly all of the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is due to a yearonyear increase in accounts payable in the medical segment that results from changes in payment patterns to suppliers of the arrow operations during 2008 where early payment discounts were forgone in favor of longer payment terms the 11 million decrease in accounts receivable reflects focused collection efforts in all segments and is in spite of higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same period of a year ago and a heavier mix of sales in our cargo handling systems business to aircraft manufacturers in 2008 which carry longer payment terms compared to the aftermarket side of that business during 2008 we repatriated approximately 104 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries 

 

cash flow from investing activities 

 

our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations in 2009 consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales of the ati businesses and power systems operations partly offset by capital expenditures of 304 million 

 

our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations in 2008 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 352 million deferred payments of 61 million with respect to acquired businesses which primarily pertained to our acquisitions of nordisk 47 million and southern wire 10 million and proceeds of 85 million from the sale of assets and investments principally 53 million related to post closing adjustments in connection with the sale of the gms business 18 million derived from the sale of investments in nonconsolidated affiliates and 10 million from the sale of a building held for sale 

 

cash flow from financing activities 

 

our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations in 2009 consisted primarily of 3576 million repayment of longterm debt and payment of dividends of 540 million partly offset by borrowings of 100 million under our revolving credit facility 

  our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations in 2008 consisted primarily of 1339 million repayment of longterm debt 928 million repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and payment of dividends of 530 million partly offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 929 million 

 

financing arrangements 

 

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

 

 

 

in connection with our acquisition of arrow in october 2007 we entered into a credit agreement which we refer to as our “senior credit agreement” that provides for a fiveyear term loan facility of 14 billion and a fiveyear revolving line of credit facility of 400 million both of which carried initial interest rates of libor plus a spread of 150 basis points the spread is subject to adjustment based upon our consolidated leverage ratio generally consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the senior credit agreement at december 31 2009 the spread over libor was 125 basis points we executed an interest rate swap for 600 million of the term loan from a floating 3 month libor rate to a fixed rate of 475 the notional value of the interest rate swap amortizes down to 350 million at maturity in 2012 our obligations under the senior credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our material whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of the shares of certain of our subsidiaries 

 

also in connection with our acquisition of arrow in october 2007 we issued 200 million in new senior notes which we refer to as the “2007 notes” and amended certain terms of our outstanding notes issued in july 2004 which we refer to as the “2004 notes” and october 2002 which we refer to as the “2002 notes” we collectively refer to the 2004 notes and the 2002 notes as the “amended notes” in addition we repaid 105 million of outstanding notes issued on november 1 1992 and december 15 1993 which we collectively refer to as the “retired notes” the retired notes consisted of the 740 senior notes due november 15 2007 and the 680 series b senior notes due december 15 2008 

 

the 2007 notes and the amended notes referred to collectively as the “senior notes” rank pari passu in right of repayment with our obligations under our senior credit agreement and are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the senior credit agreement the senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain events of default in each case on the same basis as our senior credit agreement 

  the interest rates payable on the amended notes were also modified in connection with the foregoing transactions effective as of october 1 2007 

 

  

interest rates on the amended notes are subject to reduction based on positive performance relative to certain financial ratios during 2009 we repaid the 2002 notes and attained a 25 basis point reduction on the 2004 notes 

 

fixed rate borrowings excluding the effect of derivative instruments comprised 42 of total borrowings at december 31 2009 fixed rate borrowings including the effect of derivative instruments comprised 80 of total borrowings at december 31 2009 less than 1 of our total borrowings of 11965 million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro 

 

our senior credit agreement and the senior note agreements contain covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements these agreements also require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3501 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than 3501 as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement at december 31 2009 our consolidated leverage ratio was 2951 and our interest coverage ratio was 4921 both of which are in compliance with the limits mentioned in the preceding sentence 

 

at december 31 2009 we had no borrowings outstanding and approximately 5 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our 400 million revolving credit facility this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs the availability of loans under this facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit agreement and senior note agreements moreover additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur notwithstanding these restrictions we believe that this revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december 31 2009 we would have been permitted 223 million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31 2009 notwithstanding the borrowing capacity described above additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 

 

as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all other terms of the senior credit agreement and the senior notes and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements including the leverage and interest coverage ratios throughout 2010 

 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

in addition at december 31 2009 the company had an accounts receivable securitization program under which it sells a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 125 million to a commercial paper conduit this facility is utilized from time to time for increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the credit market volatility during 2009 did not have a material impact on the 

  availability of the accounts receivable securitization program for additional information regarding this facility please refer to “off balance sheet arrangements” included in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

stock repurchase programs 

 

on june 14 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of outstanding company common stock repurchases of company stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and the company’s ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generation from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition the company’s senior loan agreements limit the aggregate amount of share repurchases and other restricted payments the company may make to 75 million per year in the event the company’s consolidated leverage ratio exceeds 35 to 1 accordingly these provisions may limit the company’s ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization through december 31 2009 no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 

 

contractual obligations 

 

contractual obligations at december 31 2009 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of 1099 million and 1161 million as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 

 

in 2009 cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were 91 million and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be in the range of 73 million to 100 million in 2010 due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance changes in interest rates and other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions we are not able to 

  reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond 2010 

 

see notes 14 and 15 respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for certain equipment the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately 97 million 

 

we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to credit markets with favorable interest rates and reduce financing costs as currently structured accounts receivable of certain domestic subsidiaries are sold on a nonrecourse basis to a special purpose entity “spe” which is a bankruptcyremote consolidated subsidiary of teleflex accordingly the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy the obligations of teleflex or any of its other subsidiaries the spe then sells undivided interests in those receivables to an asset backed commercial paper conduit the conduit issues notes secured by those interests and other assets to third party investors 

 

to the extent that cash consideration is received for the sale of undivided interests in the receivables by the spe to the conduit it is accounted for as a sale as we have relinquished control of the receivables accordingly undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the commercial paper conduit under these transactions are excluded from accounts receivable net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the interests for which cash consideration is not received from the conduit are retained by the spe and remain in accounts receivable net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets however as noted below the accounting for accounts receivables sold will change beginning in the first quarter of 2010 

 

the interests in receivables sold and the interest in receivables retained by the spe are carried at face value which is due to the shortterm nature of our accounts receivable the spe has received cash consideration of 397 million and 397 million for the interests in the accounts receivable it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively no gain or loss is recorded upon sale as fee charges from the commercial paper conduit are based upon a floating yield rate and the period the undivided interests remain outstanding fee charges from the commercial paper conduit are accrued at the end of each month if we default under the accounts receivable securitization program the commercial paper conduit is entitled to receive collections on receivables owned by the spe in satisfaction of the amount of cash consideration paid to the spe by the commercial paper conduit 

 

information regarding the outstanding balances related to the spe’s interests in accounts receivables sold or retained as of december 31 2009 is as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

the delinquency ratio for the qualifying receivables represented 38 of the total qualifying receivables as of december 31 2009 

  the following table summarizes the activity related to our interests in accounts receivable sold for the years ended december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

other fee charges related to the sale of receivables to the commercial paper conduit for the year ended december 31 2009 were not material 

 

we continue to service the receivables after they are sold to the conduit pursuant to servicing agreements with the spe no servicing asset is recorded at the time of sale because we do not receive any servicing fees from third parties or other income related to the servicing of the receivables we do not record any servicing liability at the time of the sale as the receivables collection period is relatively short and the costs of servicing the receivables sold over the servicing period are insignificant servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing period 

 

in the first quarter of 2010 we will adopt an amendment to accounting standards codification “asc” topic 860 “transfers and servicing” that affects the accounting for transfers of financial assets outstanding accounts receivable that we previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet will be included in accounts receivable net on our balance sheet and the amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program will be accounted for as a secured borrowing and reflected as shortterm debt on our balance sheet which as of december 31 2009 is 397 million for both in addition while there has been no change in the arrangement under our securitization program the adoption of this amendment will reduce cash flow from operations by approximately 397 million and result in a corresponding increase in cash flow from financing activities 

 

see also note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

  an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable considering the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 71 million at december 31 2009 and 87 million at december 31 2008 which was 26 of gross accounts receivable at those respective dates in light of the disruptions in global credit markets that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued through 2009 we have taken this heightened risk of customer payment default into account when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2009 by engaging in a more robust customerbycustomer risk assessment although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market accordingly we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 

 

our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was 353 million at december 31 2009 and 375 million at december 31 2008 which was 89 and 81 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

 

  

the ability to realize longlived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount such evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

 

  

goodwill and intangible assets by reporting segment at december 31 2009 are as follows 

 

 

  acquired intangible assets may represent indefinitelived assets eg certain trademarks or brands determinablelived intangibles eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies or residual goodwill of these only the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life the value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles assets primarily trademarks and brand names are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 

 

considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in the company’s impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

 

goodwill 

 

impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are generally its businesses one level below the respective operating segment 

 

goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company calculated fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows “dcf” of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment the more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of our reporting units were 1 the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales operating income industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units 2 the expected longterm growth rates for each of our reporting units which approximate the expected longterm growth rate of the global economy and of the respective industries in which the reporting units operate 3 discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs 4 relevant comparable company selection and 5 calculation of comparable company multiples there were no changes to the underlying methods used in the current year as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter 2009 impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit where the compound growth rates during this period range from approximately 4 to 8 for revenue and from approximately 4 to 12 for operating income discount rates were 105 for reporting units in the medical segment and 135 for reporting units in the aerospace and commercial segments a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units 

 

in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit we considered the results of both the dcf and the market comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the average of the results yielded by the two methods for each reporting unit then the current market capitalization of the company was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units plus a control premium to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization the control premium implied by our 

  analysis was approximately 34 which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 

 

no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above the fair values of our reporting units whose assets include goodwill other than the north america reporting unit within the medical segment exceed their respective carrying values by 51 to 150 for the medical — north america reporting unit the fair value is approximately 18 higher than its carrying value and at approximately 960 million the goodwill attributed to the medical — north america reporting unit is approximately 66 of our total goodwill 

 

our expected future growth rates are based on our estimates of future sales operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year which together more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle as a result of this analysis the compound annual growth rate of sales and cash flows over the projected ten year period in the medical — north america reporting unit is estimated to be 48 and 49 respectively under the income approach significant changes in assumptions would be required for this reporting unit to fail the step one test for example an increase of over oneandaquarter percent in the discount rate or a decrease of over 30 percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required 

 

intangible assets 

 

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill intangible assets obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology customer relationships and trade names the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset under this method an owner of an intangible asset determines the arms length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party the royalty which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method the excess earnings method measures economic benefit indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to an asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary or contributory assets the residual profit is taxeffected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis or more frequently if necessary in connection with the analysis management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology described above under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 

 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of indefinitelived assets during the fourth quarter of 2009 are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill by segment compound annual growth rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the medical segment ranged from 37 to 102 and a royalty rate of 40 was assumed the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the commercial segment was 20 and a royalty rate of 20 was assumed discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent 

  in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 

 

no impairment in the carrying value of any of our trade names was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above nor would impairment be evident had the fair value of each company’s indefinitelived assets been hypothetically lower than presently estimated by 10 as of september 28 2009 

 

we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets eg customer relationships instead longlived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and reassessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finitelived assets by among other things validating customer attrition rates 

 

  

in connection with the acquisition of arrow international the company recorded a 30 million charge to operations during 2007 for inprocess research and development “iprd” assets acquired that the company determined had no alternative future use in their current state this amount represents the estimated value based on riskadjusted cash flows related to inprocess projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the date of the acquisition the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 

 

the value assigned to the acquired inprocess technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value the revenue projections used to value the acquired inprocess research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales operating expenses and income taxes from such projects 

 

the rate of 14 percent utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the company’s acquisition model plus a risk premium due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects appropriate riskadjusted discount rates were used for the inprocess research and development projects the discount rates are based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased inprocess technology projects 

 

the purchased inprocess technology of arrow relates to research and development projects in the central venus access catheters peripherally inserted catheters and specialty care catheters product families 

 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

  the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows 

 

 

 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

 

 

 

  

we warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products that we will at our option repair or replace without charge such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect warranty periods vary by product we have recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty we accrue for product warranties when based on available information it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold and a reasonable estimate of the costs based on historical claims experience relative to sales can be made our estimated product warranty liability was 121 million and 171 million at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively 

 

  

we estimate the fair value of sharebased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods sharebased compensation expense is measured using a multiple point blackscholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions the expected life of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award as well as historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility the riskfree interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zerocoupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 

 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous 

  international taxing jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes and potential litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities and such adjustments could be material 

 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized based on this assessment we evaluate the need for and amount of valuation allowances to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 492 million and 579 million at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under asc topic 740 “income taxes” which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance decrease in 2009 was primarily attributable to the sale of entities associated with power systems operations utilization of certain foreign net operating losses and movement in unrealized gainloss in relation to pension valuation 

 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as defined under the income taxes topic which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known specifically we are currently in the midst of examinations by the us and german taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities which could impact our financial results

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

  

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

 

  

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances an interest rate swap is used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk the table below is an analysis of the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on december 31 2009 rates for the swap the notional amount and the related interest rate is shown by year of maturity the fair value net of tax of the interest rate swap as of december 31 2009 was a loss of 176 million reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 

 

 

 

 

  

a 10 change in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately 18 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures these are primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december 31 2009 was a gain of 03 million the following table presents our open forward currency contracts as of december 31 2009 which mature in 2010 forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies in thousands the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately 748 million 

  forward currency contracts 

 

 

 

a strengthening of 10 in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would on a combined basis adversely impact the translation of our nonus subsidiary net earnings and transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries by approximately 95 million for the year ended december 31 2010

given the range and diversity of our products and markets no one competitor offers competitive products for all the markets and customers that we serve in general all of our segments and product lines face significant competition from competitors of varying sizes although the number of competitors in each market tends to be limited we believe that our competitive position depends on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineering personnel the knowhow and skill of our manufacturing personnel and the strength and scope of our sales service and distribution networks 

 

patents and trademarks 

 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex brand and the arrow brand to be essential to the operation of our business 

 

suppliers and materials 

 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we cannot be assured of successfully passing these cost increases through to all of our customers particularly original equipment manufacturers 

seasonality 

 

portions of our revenues particularly in the commercial and medical segments are subject to seasonal fluctuations revenues in the marine aftermarket generally increase in the second quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming season incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to disposable medical products 

 

employees 

 

we employed approximately 14200 fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2008 of these employees approximately 4100 were employed in the united states and 10100 in countries outside of the united states less than 8 percent of our employees in the united states were covered by union contracts we have governmentmandated collectivebargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover employees in other countries we believe we have good relationships with our employees

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

we are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

our inability to resolve issues related to the fda corporate warning letter issued to arrow could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

on october 11 2007 arrow received a corporate warning letter from the us food and drug administration “fda” which expresses concerns with arrow’s quality systems including complaint handling corrective and preventive action process and design validation and inspection and training procedures while we are working with the fda to resolve these issues this work has required and will continue to require the dedication of significant internal and external resources there can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the fda in addition if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda we may need to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts and the fda may take further regulatory actions against us these actions may include seizing our product inventory obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree on us which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

a prolonged global economic recession combined with a continuation of volatile global credit markets could adversely impact our operating results financial condition and liquidity 

 

current global economic and financial market conditions including severe disruptions in the credit markets and the potential for a significant and prolonged global economic recession may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition this could include future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet have increased significantly in recent years primarily as a result of the acquisition of arrow international in 2007 these economic conditions may also materially impact our customers suppliers and other parties with which we do business economic and financial market conditions that adversely affect our customers may cause them to terminate existing purchase orders or to reduce the volume of products or services they purchase from us in the future the impact of the difficult economic environment was felt mostly in our commercial segment during 2008 as the markets served by our marine and auxiliary power unit products were adversely impacted we expect the marine market to remain weak for most if not all of 2009 in addition hospitals in some regions of the united states have seen a decline in admissions and a reduction in elective procedures and have limited their capital spending more than 80 percent of our medical revenues come from disposable products used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted by declines in admission adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts receivable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us changes of this type could significantly affect our liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial market conditions we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected 

 

we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of arrow or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the arrow acquisition 

 

the integration of arrow into our medical segment involves a number of risks and presents financial managerial and operational challenges in particular we may have difficulty with and may incur unanticipated expenses related to 

 

 13 

  

the success of the arrow acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from successfully combining the businesses of arrow and of teleflex medical in the time frame we anticipate if we are not able to achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the business combination may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

 

failure to successfully complete the integration of arrow or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of arrow may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we have substantial debt obligations that could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the consideration for our acquisition of arrow as of december 31 2008 our outstanding indebtedness was approximately 15 billion we will be required to use a significant portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our indebtedness over the next few years resulting in a reduction of the cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and dividends our indebtedness may also subject us to greater vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 

 

our senior credit facility and agreements with the holders of our senior notes which we refer to as our senior debt facilities impose certain operating and financial covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

in addition the terms of our senior credit facilities require us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and in the event of a significant deterioration of our economic performance we cannot assure that we will be able to satisfy those ratios a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior credit facilities if we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders under the senior credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such facilities if the lenders under the senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings and we are not able to obtain financing to satisfy this obligation we likely would have to liquidate significant assets which nevertheless may not be sufficient to repay our borrowings 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us 

 

our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of our products in particular our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings with seriously ill patients many of these products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time and component failures manufacturing flaws design defects or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks with respect to these or other products we manufacture or sell could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of the patient although the company carries product liability insurance we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage accordingly we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety and experience lost sales and be exposed to legal and reputational risk product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

 

although no material concentration of our manufacturing operations exists in any single country we have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states including operations conducted through entities that are not whollyowned and other alliances as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 44 of our total fixed assets and 53 of our total net revenues were attributable to products directly distributed from our operations outside the us our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including 

 

  

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

 

customers in our medical segment depend on third party reimbursement and the failure of healthcare programs to provide reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect our medical segment 

 

demand for some of our medical products is impacted by the reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers in the countries where we do business internationally medical reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the level of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage 

determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for some of our medical products could be adversely impacted 

 

we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business in addition as a result of their purchasing power these payors often seek discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers our provision of such pricing concessions could negatively impact our revenues and product margins 

 

uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy legislation and regulations as well as private market practices could affect our ability to sell our products in acceptable quantities at profitable prices 

 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenue from products manufactured in and sold into nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our us dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows in order to reduce the effects of this fluctuation changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

 

many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities including copper and zinc although we monitor our exposure to these commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall risk management program volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

our failure to successfully develop new products could adversely affect our results 

 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products particularly in the medical device industry which is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as the inability to 

 

  

moreover we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our revenues and margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of these intellectual property rights is important though not essential to the future success of our business in addition to relying on our patents trademarks and copyrights we rely on confidentiality 

agreements with employees and other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than ours or that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach confidentiality agreements misappropriate proprietary information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive harm that could adversely affect our business 

 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

 

the research and development of some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and the development of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and as public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge advice and input our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability contracts intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

much of our business is subject to extensive government regulation and our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations 

 

numerous national and local government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products the fda and government agencies in other countries regulate the approval manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our medical products the us federal aviation administration and the european aviation safety agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our repair stations 

 

failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing shutdowns product shortages delays in product manufacturing product seizures recalls operating restrictions withdrawal of required licenses prohibitions against exporting of products to countries outside the united states importing products from manufacturing facilities outside the us and civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all resulting in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations our medical segment facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures 

 

we are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs 

 

in addition we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 

  

these laws and government regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover we may be subject to additional environmental claims which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet revenue or profit expectations 

 

as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of services 

 

approximately 17 of our manufacturing net revenues are produced by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

on october 11 2007 the company’s subsidiary arrow international inc “arrow” received a corporate warning letter from the us food and drug administration fda the letter cites three sitespecific warning letters issued by the fda in 2005 and subsequent inspections performed from june 2005 to february 2007 at arrow’s facilities in the united states the letter expresses concerns with arrow’s quality systems including complaint handling corrective and preventive action process and design validation inspection and training procedures it also advises that arrow’s corporatewide program to evaluate correct and prevent quality system issues has been deficient limitations on premarket approvals and certificates of foreign goods had previously been imposed on arrow based on prior inspections and the corporate warning letter does not impose additional sanctions that are expected to have a material financial impact on the company 

 

in connection with its acquisition of arrow completed on october 1 2007 the company developed an integration plan that includes the commitment of significant resources to correct these previouslyidentified regulatory issues and further improve overall quality systems senior management officials from the company have met with fda representatives and a comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented to fda in late 2007 the company has begun implementing its corrective action plan which it expects to complete for most facilities and procedures by the end of march 2009 

 

while the company believes it can remediate these issues there can be no assurances regarding the length of time or expenditures required to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the fda if the company’s remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda the company may have to devote additional financial and human resources to its efforts and the fda may take further regulatory actions against the company including but not limited to seizing its product inventory obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of the company’s products assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree on us 

 

in june 2008 hm revenue and customs “hmrc” assessed airfoil technologies international uk limited “atiuk” a consolidated united kingdom venture in which the company has a 60 economic interest approximately 10 million for customs duty for the period from july 1 2005 through march 31 2008 hmrc had previously assessed atiuk approximately 737000 for customs duty for the first and second quarters of 2004 additionally for the above periods atiuk was assessed a value added tax “vat” of approximately 68 million for which hmrc has advised atiuk that to the extent it is due and payable it has until march 2010 to fully recover such vat the assessments were imposed because hmrc concluded that atiuk did not provide the necessary documentation for which reliance on inland processing relief status duty and vat was claimed by atiuk 

 

atiuk has filed appeals and been granted hardship applications to avoid payment of the assessment while the appeal is pending regarding each of the assessments atiuk provided certain documentation to hmrc with regard to the first quarter of 2004 and as a result the hmrc reduced the assessment for customs duties for that quarter by 97 from approximately 17860 to 450 and reduced the assessment for vat for that quarter by 99 from approximately 117540 to 1650 which amounts have been paid and all vat recovered atiuk has provided essentially the same types of supporting documentation to hmrc for the remaining quarters for which it was assessed based on discussions between atiuk and the hmrc inspector with regard to the assessments for the remaining periods atiuk is hopeful that it will obtain reductions in the assessments that are proportionately similar to those obtained for the first quarter of 2004 however the company cannot assure whether or the extent to which the hmrc will reduce its assessments for these periods in the event atiuk is not 

successful in a favorable resolution of the remaining assessments such outcome would have a material adverse effect on the business of atiuk the company has a net investment in atiuk of approximately 11 million 

 

in addition we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability intellectual property import and export regulations employment and environmental matters based on information currently available advice of counsel established reserves and other resources we do not believe that any such actions are likely to be individually or in the aggregate material to our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity however in the event of unexpected further developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters or other similar matters if unfavorable may be materially adverse to our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

various senior and term note agreements provide for the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and payment of cash dividends under the most restrictive of these provisions on an annual basis 99 million of retained earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at december 31 2008 on february 24 2009 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 034 per share on our common stock which is payable on march 17 2009 to holders of record on march 5 2009 as of february 24 2009 we had approximately 846 holders of record of our common stock 

 

on june 14 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of outstanding company common stock repurchases of company stock under the program may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and the company’s ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generation from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition under the senior loan agreements entered into october 1 2007 the company is subject to certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase shares in the event the company’s consolidated leverage ratio exceeds certain levels which further limit the company’s ability to repurchase shares under this program through december 31 2008 no shares have been purchased under this plan 

 

on july 25 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 140 million of outstanding teleflex common stock over twelve months ended july 2006 in june 2006 our board of directors extended for an additional six months until january 2007 its authorization for the repurchase of shares under the board’s authorization we repurchased a total of 2317347 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 1400 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

teleflex strives to maintain a portfolio of businesses that provide consistency of performance improved profitability and sustainable growth to this end in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to improve margins reduce cyclicality and focus our resources on the development of our core businesses we continually evaluate the composition of the portfolio of our businesses to ensure alignment with our overall objectives 

 

we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through our internal growth initiatives which include the development of new products expansion of market share moving existing products into new geographies and through selected acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development initiatives and our ability to grow market share 

 

in 2007 the company completed acquisitions in all three business segments and significant divestitures in both commercial and aerospace these portfolio actions resulted in a significant expansion of our medical segment operations and a significant reduction in our commercial segment operations the following bullet points summarize our more significant acquisitions and divestitures in 2007 and the results for the acquired businesses are included in the respective segments see notes 3 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our significant acquisitions and divestitures 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

we incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the consideration for our october 2007 acquisition of arrow as of december 31 2008 our outstanding indebtedness was approximately 15 billion 

down from 17 billion as of december 31 2007 for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see “liquidity and capital resources” below and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

we operated in an increasingly challenging global economic environment in 2008 recent unprecedented turbulence in the global financial and commodities markets and the downturn in the business cycle have had an adverse impact on market activities including among other things failure of financial institutions falling asset values diminished liquidity and reduced demand for products and services particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008 the impact of the difficult economic environment was felt mostly in the commercial segment during 2008 and we adjusted production levels and took new restructuring actions in response to the current environment although on a consolidated basis the economic conditions have not had a significant adverse impact to our financial position results of operations or liquidity during 2008 the continuation of the broad economic trends could adversely affect our operations in the future as described below the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed in “liquidity and capital resources” in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

  

hospitals in some regions of the united states have seen a decline in admissions and a reduction in elective procedures and have limited their capital spending more than 80 percent of our medical revenues come from disposable products used in critical care and surgical applications and our sales volume could be negatively impacted by declines in admissions in addition a small percentage of our revenues could be impacted by changes in capital spending or a decline in elective procedures 

 

at the same time future changes in government funding patterns or regulation could have an impact on our business in the united states a number of states have enacted or proposed reduced funding for medicaid programs and higher rates of unemployment are increasing the percentage of uninsured patients who do not have the ability to pay for care this could create further cost pressure on hospitals and consequently on our business our business could also be impacted by healthcare reform legislation enacted by congress although the impact of the economic downturn on hospitals outside the united states has been less pronounced to date funding to these healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments

results of operations 

 

discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelvemonth period 

 

the following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations of tamg the gms businesses and a small medical business which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for discussion of discontinued operations 

 

  

 

 

net revenues increased approximately 25 to 242 billion from 193 billion in 2007 businesses acquired in the past twelve months accounted for all of this increase in revenues as foreign currency translation contributed 1 to revenue growth while revenues from core business declined 1 compared to 2007 core revenue growth in the medical segment 2 and aerospace 2 was offset by a 9 decline in core revenues in the commercial segment which was primarily due to a significant decrease in sales of recreational marine products and auxiliary power units sold into the north american truck market due to softness in these markets caused by a weak economic environment during 2008 

 

revenues increased 14 in 2007 to 193 billion from 169 billion in 2006 entirely due to acquisitions and foreign currency movements overall there was no core revenue growth in 2007 as compared to 2006 core growth in our aerospace segment was 7 and our medical and commercial segments declined 1 and 5 respectively year over year 

 

  

 

 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 398 in 2008 from 352 in 2007 this trend is driven by increases in the medical and aerospace segments as the gross profit percentage in the commercial segment was unchanged from 2007 improved margins in the medical segment were largely due to the inclusion of higher margin arrow critical care product lines for the full year in 2008 compared to only the fourth quarter in 2007 and volume related manufacturing efficiencies in the medical oem product line improved 

margins in the aerospace segment are principally due to a shift in sales favoring engine repair services and away from sales of lower margin replacement parts in the engine repairs business 

 

gross profit as a percentage of revenues improved to 352 in 2007 from 346 in 2006 due primarily to cost and productivity improvements in our medical segment and the benefits of restructuring initiatives and other cost reduction efforts which offset the negative impact of a 29 million charge related to a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which was sold during 2007 

 

  

 

 

selling engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 247 in 2008 compared to 230 in 2007 principally due to approximately 25 million higher amortization expense related to the arrow acquisition and approximately 20 million higher expenses in the medical segment related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues 

 

selling engineering and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 230 in 2007 compared with 222 in 2006 due primarily to approximately 7 million higher amortization expense from the arrow acquisition 

 

  

 

 

in 2007 during our annual test for goodwill impairment we determined 164 million of goodwill attributable to our businesses that manufacture and sell auxiliary power units in the north american heavy truck and rail markets as well as components and systems for use of alternative fuels in industrial vehicles and passenger cars was impaired softness in certain of these markets at that time negatively impacted the valuation of goodwill resulting in the impairment charge the remaining 25 million goodwill impairment is related to a writedown to the agreed selling price of one our variable interest entities in the commercial segment 

 

the 300 million writeoff of inprocess research and development costs is related to inprocess rd projects acquired in the arrow acquisition which we determined had no alternative future use in their current state 

 

  

 

 

interest expense increased significantly in 2008 compared to 2007 principally as a result of the full year impact of the debt incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition in october 2007 interest income decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to lower amounts of invested funds combined with lower average interest rates 

interest expense increased from 412 million to 749 million in 2007 principally as a result of higher debt levels since october 1 2007 incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition interest income increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average cash balances during the first three quarters of 2007 

 

  

 

 

the effective tax rate in 2007 was 1123 compared to 236 in 2008 and 216 in 2006 taxes on income from continuing operations of 1228 million in 2007 include discrete income tax charges incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition specifically in connection with funding the acquisition of arrow the company i repatriated approximately 1970 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries which had previously been deemed to be permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions and ii changed its position with respect to certain additional previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these earnings as no longer permanently reinvested these items resulted in a discrete income tax charge in 2007 of approximately 918 million the company did not incur similar charges in 2008 or 2006 

 

  

 

 

in december 2008 we began certain restructuring initiatives that affect the commercial segment these initiatives involve the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at three of our facilities in europe and north america we determined to undertake these initiatives to improve operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources these costs amounted to approximately 19 million during 2008 as of december 31 2008 we estimate that the aggregate of future restructuring charges that we will incur in connection with this program are approximately 33 — 45 million in 2009 of this amount 28 — 31 million relates to employee termination costs 02 — 10 million to facility closure costs and 03 — 04 million to contract termination costs primarily relating to leases we expect to have realized annual pretax savings of between 4 — 5 million in 2010 when these restructuring actions are complete 

 

in connection with the acquisition of arrow during 2007 we formulated a plan related to the future integration of arrow and our other medical businesses the integration plan focuses on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing sales marketing and distribution functions in north america europe and asia costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of arrow have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of teleflex are charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations these costs amounted to approximately 221 million during 2008 as of december 31 2008 we estimate that the aggregate of future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the arrow integration plan are approximately 180 — 210 million in 2009 and 2010 of this amount 75 — 85 million relates to employee termination costs 12 — 17 million relates to facility closure costs 92 — 105 million relates to contract termination costs associated with the termination of leases and certain distribution agreements and 01 — 03 million relates to other restructuring costs we also have incurred restructuring related costs in the medical segment which do not qualify for 

classification as restructuring costs in 2008 these costs amounted to 70 million and are reported in the medical segment’s operating results in selling engineering and administrative expenses we expect to have realized annual pretax savings of between 7075 million in 2010 when these integration and restructuring actions are complete 

 

in june 2006 we began certain restructuring initiatives that affected all three of our operating segments these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america we took these initiatives as a means to improving operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources and these activities are now complete 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2004 we commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for future earnings growth the actions included exiting or divesting noncore or low performing businesses consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services and these activities are now complete 

 

for additional information regarding our restructuring programs see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

impairment charges in 2008 are composed of 27 million related to five of our minority held investments precipitated by the deteriorating economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 08 million impairment of an intangible asset in the commercial segment that was identified during the annual impairment testing process and a 02 million reduction in the carrying value of a building held for sale in 2007 we determined that two minorityheld investments certain intangible assets and a building held for sale were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of 64 million in 2006 we determined that three minorityheld investments and a building held for sale were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of 74 million 

 

segment review 

 

 

 

the percentage increases or decreases in revenues during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 compared to the respective prior years were due to the following factors 

 

 

the following is a discussion of our segment operating results additional information regarding our segments including a reconciliation of segment operating profit to income from continuing operations before interest taxes and minority interest is presented in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

medical 

 

  

medical segment net revenues grew 44 in 2008 to 14991 million from 10413 million in 2007 the acquisition of arrow accounted for 40 of this increase in revenues of the remaining 4 increase in net revenues 2 was due to foreign currency fluctuations and 2 was due to core revenue growth medical segment core revenue growth in 2008 reflects higher sales volume for critical care and surgical products in europe and asialatin america of approximately 13 million and 8 million respectively and a 17 million increase in sales of specialty medical devices to oems partially offset by 23 million lower sales volumes for critical care and surgical products in north america 

 

net sales by product group are comprised of the following 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenues by end market for the medical segment 

 

 

 

medical segment’s net revenues are geographically comprised of the following 

 

 

 

the increase in critical care product sales during 2008 compared to 2007 was almost entirely due to the acquisition of arrow in the fourth quarter of 2007 which expanded our vascular access and regional anesthesia product lines and contributed an incremental 360 million of sales to the critical care category in 2008 over 2007 favorable currency fluctuations added 14 million to sales and higher sales of vascular access products in europe contributed another 5 million in core revenue growth 

 

surgical product sales were essentially flat in 2008 compared to 2007 as the benefit of favorable foreign currency movements in europe 6 million and higher volume in european and asialatin american markets 6 million was offset by 12 million lower volumes in north america this decline in north america was primarily in the chest drainage and instrumentation product lines 

 

cardiac care product sales increased as a result of the arrow acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007 

in 2008 sales to oems increased primarily as a result of higher sales of orthopedic instrumentation specialty sutures and other devices of approximately 17 million and an acquisition in the orthopedic product line in early 2007 approximately 3 million 

 

operating profit in the medical segment increased 57 in 2008 to 2863 million from 1826 million in 2007 principally due to the addition of higher margin arrow critical care product lines other factors that contributed to the higher operating profit were improved cost and operational efficiencies in north america higher volumes in europe and asialatin america lower fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition 7 million in 2008 versus 29 million in 2007 and the favorable impact from the stronger euro the impact of these factors was partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 million higher amortization expense related to the arrow acquisition and 20 million in higher costs incurred in 2008 in connection with a plan to remediate fda regulatory issues 

 

  

medical segment net revenues increased 21 in 2007 to 10413 million from 8587 million in 2006 entirely due to acquisitions and currency movements revenues related to the acquisition of arrow international contributed 1338 million or 16 of this increase increased sales of disposable medical products for airway management respiratory care urology and surgical devices to european hospital markets and to asian hospital markets was more than offset by a decline in sales of orthopedic specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers the phase out of some product lines for medical device manufacturers and a decline in sales of products for alternate sites in north america 

 

medical segment operating profit increased 13 in 2007 to 1826 million from 1617 million in 2006 primarily due to the increase in volume from the arrow acquisition the positive impact from the full year effect of cost and productivity improvements that began in the second half of 2006 following completion of significant restructuring activities and currency movements which more than offset the negative impact from a 29 million charge in 2007 related to the fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which was sold in 2007 during the first half of 2006 operating profit was negatively impacted by costs associated with operational inefficiencies and the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers 

 

aerospace 

 

  

aerospace segment net revenues grew 13 in 2008 to 5112 million from 4518 million in 2007 the expansion of the cargo containers product line due to the acquisition of nordisk aviation products accounted for 10 of this increase the 2 increase in core growth is primarily attributable to increased sales of narrow body cargo loading systems and wide body and narrow body cargo spare components and repairs 

 

segment operating profit increased 32 in 2008 to 618 million from 470 million in 2007 the increase was principally due to the impact of the nordisk acquisition and favorable product mix of repair versus replacement in the engine repair services business as a result of technology investments we have made consolidation of operations and phasing out of lower margin product lines in the engine repair services business during 2007 also had a positive impact on operating profit in 2008 

 

  

aerospace segment net revenues increased 11 in 2007 to 4518 million from 4054 million in 2006 this increase was due to increases of 7 from core growth 3 from acquisitions and 1 from foreign currency movements core growth was primarily attributable to increased sales of wide body cargo handling systems and narrow body cargo loading systems combined with steady increases in sales volume for aftermarket spares and repairs throughout the year 

aerospace segment operating profit increased 17 to 470 million from 402 million in 2006 as a result of higher volume productivity improvements and cost control efforts in both the cargo handling systems and engine repair businesses as well as the positive impact of restructuring in engine repair services 

 

commercial 

 

  

commercial segment net revenues declined approximately 7 in 2008 to 4106 million from 4412 million in 2007 core revenue declined 9 as a result of a 16 decline in sales of marine products for the recreational boat market and a 22 decline in sales of auxiliary power units for the north american truck market which was partially offset by a 12 increase in sales of alternate fuel systems and an 11 increase in sales of rigging services products extreme volatility in fuel costs accompanied by deterioration in the general state of the global economy in the second half of 2008 adversely impacted the markets served by our marine and auxiliary power unit products and we expect the marine market to remain weak for most if not all of 2009 as a result we adjusted production levels and took new restructuring actions in response to the current environment conversely high fuel prices in 2008 increased demand for alternate fuel systems and we successfully penetrated a large emerging compressed natural gas market in south america during the year 

 

in 2008 segment operating profit increased 19 to 275 million compared to 230 million in 2007 this increase was principally due to favorable product mix and an acquisition during 2007 in the rigging services business favorable currency impact of approximately 3 million cost reductions and lower warranty expenses in the power systems business offset the lower operating profit in the marine business resulting from lower sales in 2008 

 

  

commercial segment revenues increased 3 in 2007 to 4412 million from 4268 million in 2006 the favorable impact of acquisitions and foreign currency movements and an increase in sales of products for marine markets offset a decline in core revenue attributable to a significant decline in sales of auxiliary power units in the north american heavy truck market and to lower sales of rigging services where unusually high demand as a result of us gulf coast rebuilding activities due to severe weather during 2006 caused unfavorable comparisons in 2007 

 

commercial segment operating profit declined 25 in 2007 to 230 million from 305 million in 2006 operating profit was negatively impacted by commodity price increases lower volumes of auxiliary power units and from approximately 4 million in provisions for warranty and other costs related to prior generation auxiliary power units sold to the north american truck market which more than offset the positive impact of cost and productivity improvements in the business serving the marine market operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to 52 in 2007 from 71 in 2006 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows in addition to operating cash flows other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures acquisitions pension funding dividends common stock repurchases adequacy of available bank lines of credit and access to other capital markets 

 

the deterioration in global economic conditions and the severe disruptions in global credit markets that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 affected the operating results of our various businesses as described above in “results of operations” in assessing the impact of these factors on our liquidity we do not currently foresee any difficulties meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months to date we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment default by our customers and we have 

sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund additional operating needs however taking into consideration current economic conditions we recognize the increased risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity if current market conditions continue to deteriorate we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our customers’ purchases from us which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

 

recent deterioration in the securities markets has impacted the value of the assets included in our defined benefit pension plans as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets our domestic pension funds experienced approximately 76 million or 29 decline in value during 2008 while this will increase pension expense in 2009 compared to 2008 we do not expect this to cause a significant increase to our pension funding requirements for 2009 because amounts funded to the plans in prior years exceeded the minimum amounts required in those years the volatility in the securities markets has not significantly affected the liquidity of our pension plans or counterparty exposure substantially all of our domestic pension plans are invested in mutual funds registered with the sec under the investment company act of 1940 underlying holdings of the mutual funds are invested in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities 

 

we manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations we have and will continue to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so substantially all of our debt service requirements are united states based and we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of these requirements we anticipate our domestic principal and interest payments for 2009 will be approximately 189 million and we expect to access approximately 95 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries in 2009 to help fund these debt service requirements to the extent we cannot or choose not to repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service requirements our revolving credit facility is utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner 

 

we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and cash equivalents borrowings under our revolving credit facility and additional sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and debt obligations 

 

a summary of our cash flows for the last three years is as follows 

 

 

 

cash flow from operating activities 

 

higher tax payments of approximately 112 million net of refunds of approximately 27 million and higher interest payments of approximately 60 million were the principal factors in the yearonyear decrease in cash flows from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 the largest factor contributing to the higher tax payments is approximately 90 million of taxes paid in connection with businesses divested in 2007 

all together changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease in cash from operations of approximately 110 million during 2008 which is principally attributable to the 90 million of tax payments mentioned previously the cash flow impact from changes in other operating assets and liabilities offset one another an inventory increase of approximately 21 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 8 million decrease in accounts receivable of 3 million and a decrease in other operating assets of 6 million the ramp up in production of cargo handling systems to meet the delivery schedules communicated earlier in the year from aircraft manufacturers and the late in the year delay of those delivery schedules into 2009 was the principal 14 million cause of the yearonyear increase in inventory nearly all of the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is due to a yearonyear increase in accounts payable in the medical segment that results from changes in payment patterns to suppliers of the arrow operations during 2008 where early payment discounts were forgone in favor of longer payment terms the 3 million decrease in accounts receivable reflects focused collection efforts in all segments and is in spite of higher sales during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same period of a year ago and a heavier mix of sales in our cargo handling systems business to aircraft manufacturers in 2008 which carry longer payment terms compared to the aftermarket side of that business during 2008 we repatriated approximately 104 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries 

 

changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2007 resulted in a net cash inflow of 769 million the most significant change was a decrease in inventories of 624 million 25 million of which is due to the resolution in 2007 of operational inefficiencies experienced in the medical segment during the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers in 2005 and 2006 and focused inventory reduction initiatives in the arrow operations postacquisition and 29 million is the impact from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which was sold during 2007 during 2007 we repatriated approximately 208 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries exclusive of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations 

 

cash flow from investing activities 

 

our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations in 2008 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 393 million 57 million of payments for businesses acquired that had been deferred at closing which primarily pertained to our acquisitions of nordisk 47 million and southern wire 10 million an additional investment of 22 million in our propulsion technologies joint venture and proceeds of 85 million from the sale of assets and investments principally 53 million related to post closing adjustments in connection with the sale of the gms business sale of investments in nonconsolidated affiliates of 18 million and the sale of a held for sale building for 10 million 

 

our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations during 2007 consisted primarily of payments of 22 billion for businesses acquired of which 21 billion pertained to the acquisition of arrow international during 2007 we received proceeds of approximately 7023 million from the sale of the commercial segment’s automotive and industrial business and the aerospace segment’s precision machined components business 

 

cash flow from financing activities 

 

our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations in 2008 consisted primarily of 1339 million repayment of longterm debt 928 million repayment of revolver borrowings additional borrowings under the revolver of 929 million payment of dividends of 530 million and payments to minority interest shareholders of 380 million which relate to the distribution of dividends from our ati joint venture 

 

our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations during 2007 consisted primarily of new longterm borrowings of 16 billion in connection with the arrow acquisition the payment of fees of 216 million to obtain that debt and the repayment of 4634 million of debt we repaid approximately 

540 million of debt in connection with the arrow acquisition and repaid approximately 3866 million of longterm debt with the proceeds from the disposal of the automotive and industrial businesses 

 

cash flows used in discontinued operations of 56 million in 2008 reflects the settlement of a contingency related to the gms businesses which were sold in 2007 

 

financing arrangements 

 

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

 

 

 

in connection with the october 2007 acquisition of arrow we entered into a credit agreement “the senior credit facility” that provides for a fiveyear term loan facility of 14 billion and a fiveyear revolving line of credit facility of 400 million both of which carried initial interest rates of libor plus a spread of 150 basis points the spread is subject to adjustment based upon our leverage ratio at december 31 2008 the spread over libor was 125 basis points we executed an interest rate swap for 600 million of the term loan from a floating 3 month libor rate to a fixed rate of 475 the notional value of the interest rate swap amortizes down to 350 million at maturity in 2012 our obligations under the senior credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our material whollyowned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of the shares of certain of our subsidiaries 

 

also in connection with our acquisition of arrow on october 1 2007 we issued 200 million in new senior notes the “2007 notes” and amended certain terms of our outstanding notes issued on july 8 2004 the “2004 notes” and october 25 2002 the “2002 notes” and together with the 2004 notes the “amended notes” in addition we repaid 105 million of outstanding notes issued on november 1 1992 and december 15 1993 collectively the “retired notes” the retired notes consisted of the 740 senior notes due november 15 2007 and the 680 series b senior notes due december 15 2008 

 

the 2007 notes and the amended notes referred to collectively as the “senior notes” rank pari passu in right of repayment with our obligations under the senior credit facility the “primary bank obligations” and are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the senior credit facility the senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain events of default in each case on the same basis as the senior credit facility 

 

the interest rates payable on the amended notes were also modified in connection with the foregoing transactions effective as of october 1 2007 

 

 37 

  

  

interest rates on the amended notes are subject to reduction based on positive performance relative to certain financial ratios 

 

fixed rate borrowings excluding the effect of derivative instruments comprised 36 of total borrowings at december 31 2008 fixed rate borrowings including the effect of derivative instruments comprised 74 of total borrowings at december 31 2008 approximately 2 of our total borrowings of 15464 million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro 

 

the senior credit facility and the senior note agreements contain covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements these agreements also require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio defined in the senior credit facility as “consolidated leverage ratio” and an interest coverage ratio defined in the senior credit facility as “consolidated interest coverage ratio” at the levels and as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or nearest to the dates set forth in the table below calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit facility 

 

 

 

at december 31 2008 we had 368 million of borrowings outstanding under our 400 million revolving lineofcredit facility this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs the availability of loans under this facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility and senior note agreements moreover additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit facility were to occur notwithstanding these restrictions we believe that this revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility for the year ended december 31 2008 we would have been permitted 334 million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december 31 2008 in addition we believe that we will continue to have adequate borrowing availability under this facility after giving effect to the scheduled reduction in the leverage ratio covenant to 3501 at september 30 2009 notwithstanding the borrowing capacity described above additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the ratios set forth in the table above are met after giving proforma effect of the ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility of the business acquired 

as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all other terms of the senior credit facility and the senior notes and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements including the leverage and interest coverage ratios throughout 2009 

 

for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

in addition at december 31 2008 the company had an accounts receivable securitization program to sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to 125 million to a commercial paper conduit this facility is utilized from time to time for increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements the credit market volatility during 2008 did not have a material impact on the availability of the accounts receivable securitization program for additional information regarding this facility please refer to “off balance sheet arrangements” included in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

stock repurchase programs

we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for certain equipment the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately 19 million 

 

we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs as currently structured accounts receivable of certain domestic subsidiaries are sold on a nonrecourse basis to a special purpose entity “spe” which is a bankruptcyremote subsidiary of teleflex incorporated that is consolidated in our financial statements this spe then sells undivided interests in those receivables to an asset backed commercial paper conduit the conduit issues notes secured by those interests and other assets to third party investors 

 

to the extent that cash consideration is received for the sale of undivided interests in the receivables by the spe to the conduit it is accounted for as a sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” as we have relinquished control of the receivables accordingly undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the commercial paper conduit under these transactions are excluded from accounts receivables net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the interests not represented by cash consideration from the conduit are retained by the spe and remain in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

 

the interests in receivables sold and the interest in receivables retained by the spe are carried at face value which is due to the shortterm nature of our accounts receivable the special purpose entity has received cash consideration of 397 million and 397 million for the interests in the accounts receivable it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively no gain or loss is recorded upon sale as fee charges from the commercial paper conduit are based upon a floating yield rate and the period the undivided interests remain outstanding fee charges from the commercial paper conduit are accrued at the end of each month should we default under the accounts receivable securitization program the commercial paper conduit is entitled to receive collections on receivables owned by the spe in satisfaction of the amount of cash consideration paid to the spe to the commercial paper conduit the assets of the spe are not available to satisfy the obligations of teleflex or any of its other subsidiaries 

 

information regarding the outstanding balances related to the spe’s interests in accounts receivables sold or retained as of december 31 2008 is as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

the delinquency ratio for the qualifying receivables represented 376 of the total qualifying receivables as of december 31 2008 

 

the following table summarizes the activity related to our interests in accounts receivable sold for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

 40 

 

other fee charges related to the sale of receivables to the commercial paper conduit for the year ended december 31 2008 were not material 

 

we continue servicing the receivables sold pursuant to servicing agreements with the spe no servicing asset is recorded at the time of sale because we do not receive any servicing fees from third parties or other income related to the servicing of the receivables we do not record any servicing liability at the time of the sale as the receivables collection period is relatively short and the costs of servicing the receivables sold over the servicing period are insignificant servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing period

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

 

  

in the ordinary course of business we grant noninterest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms in an effort to reduce our credit risk we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers’ receivables and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer’s outstanding receivable balance 

 

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable considering the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 87 million at december 31 2008 and 70 million at december 31 2007 which was 26 and 21 of gross accounts receivable at those respective dates in light of the disruptions in global credit markets that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 we have taken this heightened risk of customer payment default into account when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts at december 31 2008 by engaging in a more robust customerbycustomer risk assessment although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience however if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur additional allowances may be required 

 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market accordingly we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value 

include i current sales data and historical return rates ii estimates of future demand iii competitive pricing pressures iv new product introductions v product expiration dates and vi component and packaging obsolescence 

 

the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 

 

our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was 375 million at december 31 2008 and 359 million at december 31 2007 which was 81 and 79 of gross inventories at those respective dates 

 

  

the ability to realize longlived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount such evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

 

  

goodwill and intangible assets by reporting segment at december 31 2008 are as follows 

 

 

 

acquired intangible assets may represent indefinitelived assets eg certain trademarks or brands determinablelived intangibles eg certain trademarks or brands customer relationships patents and technologies or residual goodwill of these only the costs of determinablelived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life the value of the indefinitelived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinitelived intangibles goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles assets primarily trademarks and brand names are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 

 

considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value assumptions used in the company’s impairment evaluations such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital are consistent with internal projections and operating plans we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

 

goodwill 

 

impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level for purposes of this assessment the company’s reporting units are generally its businesses one level below the respective operating segment 

goodwill impairment is determined using a twostep process the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill in performing the first step the company calculated fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods one which estimates the discounted cash flows “dcf” of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the market approach if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 

 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates perpetual growth rates operating margins industry trends regulatory environment relevant comparable company selection calculation of comparable company multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter 2008 impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit where the compound annual growth rates during this period for the medical aerospace and commercial segments range from approximately 4 to 7 for revenue and from approximately 8 to 13 for operating income discount rates range from 105 to 140 and a perpetual growth rate of 25 was assumed for all reporting units 

 

the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on internal budgets and business plans and various longterm growth assumptions beyond the business plan period discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs 

 

in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit we considered the results of both the dcf and the market comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the average of the results yielded by the two methods for each reporting unit then the current market capitalization of the company was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units plus a control premium to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately 35 which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above in light of market conditions in the fourth quarter we considered whether there were any triggering events which would have caused us to reassess our goodwill impairment considerations as of the assessment date and we determined that there were no triggering events 

 

to illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges relative to future changes in projected operating income and discount rates the following table shows the sensitivity to 10 and 15 percentage point increases in the discount rate or a 10 and 25 reduction in the compound annual growth rate of operating income 

 

 

 

none of these scenarios resulted in an indication of impairment in any of our reporting units while we are not aware of any known trends uncertainties or other factors that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material impairment charge in the future events could occur in the future which are currently unforeseen that could result in an impairment 

intangible assets 

 

intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill intangible assets acquired are comprised mainly of technology customer relationships and trade names the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset the royalty which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales is taxeffected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method the excess earnings method measures economic benefit indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to an asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary or contributory assets the residual profit is taxeffected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 

 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis or more frequently if necessary in connection with the analysis management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to its estimated fair value since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value common among such approaches is the “relief from royalty” methodology this methodology estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate discount rate and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 

 

discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of indefinitelived assets during the fourth quarter of 2008 are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill by segment compound annual growth rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the medical segment ranged from 385 to 1167 and a royalty rate of 40 was assumed the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the commercial segment was 536 and a royalty rate of 20 was assumed discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 

 

this analysis indicated that certain trade names in the commercial segment were impaired by 08 million and this was charged to restructuring and other impairment charges during the fourth quarter of 2008 had the fair value of each company’s indefinitelived assets been hypothetically lower than presently estimated by 10 as of september 29 2008 certain trade names in the commercial segment would have been impaired by an additional 10 million and the arrow trade name would have been impaired 8 million 

 

longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets eg customer relationships do not require that an annual impairment test be performed instead longlived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events include the likely ie more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and reassessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finitelived assets by among other things validating customer attrition rates 

 

  

in connection with the acquisition of arrow international the company recorded a 30 million charge to operations during 2007 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” for inprocess research and development “iprd” assets acquired that the 

company determined had no alternative future use in their current state the company continues to evaluate certain of these projects for their feasibility and alignment with the company’s core strategic objectives 

 

as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation for arrow approximately 30 million of the purchase price was allocated to acquire inprocess research and development projects the amount allocated to the acquired inprocess research and development represents the estimated value based on riskadjusted cash flows related to inprocess projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the date of the acquisition the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner the company may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects 

 

the value assigned to the acquired inprocess technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value the revenue projections used to value the acquired inprocess research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales operating expenses and income taxes from such projects 

 

the rate of 14 percent utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the company’s acquisition model plus a risk premium due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects appropriate riskadjusted discount rates were used for the inprocess research and development projects the discount rates are based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased inprocess technology projects 

 

the purchased inprocess technology of arrow relates to research and development projects in the following product families central venus access catheters “cvc” and specialty care catheters “specialty care” 

 

the most significant purchased set of inprocess technologies relates to the cvc product family for which the company estimated a value of 25 million the projects included in this product family’s inprocess technology include the hic project picc triple lumen antimicrobial picc and certain catheter tip positioning technology 

 

the remaining purchased set of inprocess technologies relates to the specialty care product family for which the company has estimated a value of 5 million the projects included in this product family’s inprocess technology include the ethanol lock program and antimicrobial chdc 

 

the successful development of new products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties both known and unknown including unanticipated delays access to capital budget overruns technical problems and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design development and commercialization of these new products and enhancements including for example changes requested by the fda in connection with premarket approval applications for products or 510k notification given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction there can be no assurance that any of the company’s product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget if at all the failure of the company to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm the company’s results of operations and financial condition for additional risks that may affect the company’s business and prospects following completion of the merger see “risk factors” commencing on page 13 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

 

the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows 

 

 

 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense the following table shows the sensitivity to changes in the weighted average assumptions 

 

 

 

  

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of the sales we estimate our warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors including historical trends of units sold the status of existing claims recall programs and communication with customers our estimated product warranty liability was 171 million and 200 million at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively 

 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes and potentially litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates which the company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled the likelihood of a material change in the company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks final us and foreign tax settlements and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding 

income taxes are appropriate significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities and such adjustments could be material 

 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized based on this assessment we evaluate the need for and amount of valuation allowances to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 512 million and 685 million at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance decrease in 2008 was principally attributable to i the deconsolidation of a subsidiary ii the increased ability to utilize certain state net operating losses as a result of the mergers of several subsidiaries and iii the increased ability to utilize certain state net operating losses as a result of a shift in state apportionment factors following the gms transaction 

 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as defined by fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement 109” “fin 48” which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known

january 1 2009 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 157 with respect to nonfinancial assets and liabilities under fsp 1572 and this adoption did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

in october 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active” fsp 1573 clarifies the application of sfas no 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active fsp 1573 became effective upon issuance and did not have a material impact on the company’s fair value of financial assets as a result of the adoption of fsp 1573 refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on fair value measurements 

 

business combinations in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” sfas no 141r replaces sfas no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r retains the fundamental requirements in statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting which statement 141 called the purchase method  be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination sfas no 141r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control sfas no 141r’s scope is broader than that of statement 141 which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 

 

sfas no 141r replaces statement 141’s costallocation process and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date with limited exceptions in addition sfas no 141r changes the allocation and treatment of acquisitionrelated costs restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not obligated to incur the recognition of assets and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies and the recognition and measurement of goodwill this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and is to be applied prospectively to business combinations accordingly the company will apply the provisions of sfas no 141r upon adoption on its effective date 

 

noncontrolling interests in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” sfas no 160 amends accounting research bulletin “arb” 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary sometimes referred to as minority interest and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas no 160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity but separate from the parent’s equity that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income that the changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and that when a subsidiary is deconsolidated any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited accordingly the company will apply the provisions of sfas no 160 upon adoption on its effective date 

 

disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133” which requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities companies will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why a company uses derivative instruments b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 133 and related interpretations and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the company’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal 

and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 accordingly the company will ensure that it meets the enhanced disclosure provisions of sfas no 161 upon the effective date 

 

determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities in june 2008 the fasb issued fsp eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” which addresses whether unvested instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities subject to the twoclass method of computing earnings per share under sfas no 128 “earnings per share” fsp eitf 0361 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years the company is currently evaluating the guidance under fsp eitf 0361 but does not expect it will result in a change in the company’s earnings per share or diluted earnings per share 

 

determination of the useful life of intangible assets in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” which amends sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 142 regarding the factors that should be considered in developing the useful lives for intangible assets with renewal or extension provisions fsp fas 1423 requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements regardless of whether those arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions when determining the useful life of an intangible asset in the absence of such experience an entity shall consider the assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension adjusted for entityspecific factors fsp fas 1423 will be effective for qualifying intangible assets acquired by the company on or after january 1 2009 the application of fsp fas 1423 did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position upon adoption however future transactions entered into by the company will need to be evaluated under the requirements of this fsp 

 

fasb accounting standards codification in december 2008 the fasb issued a news release for the expected launch of the fasb accounting standards codification the codification is a major restructuring of accounting and reporting standards the codification does not change gaap but instead it introduces a new structure it will supersede all accounting standards in existing fasb emerging issues task force eitf american institute of certified public accountants aicpa and related standards the codification is expected to become authoritative on july 1 2009 at which time only two levels of us gaap will exist authoritative represented by the codification and nonauthoritative represented by all other literature 

 

in december 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas no 132r1 “employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets” fsp fas 132r1 which requires additional disclosures for employers’ pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets as pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were not included within the scope of sfas no 157 fsp fas 132r1 requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under sfas no 157 the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets fsp fas 132r1 will be effective for the company as of december 31 2009 as fsp fas 132r1 provides only disclosure requirements the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial positions

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

  

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

  

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk the table below is an analysis of the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on december 31 2008 rates for the swaps notional amounts and related interest rates are shown by year of maturity the fair value net of tax of the interest rate swap as of december 31 2008 was a loss of 270 million 

 

 

 

 

  

a 10 change in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately 24 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures these are all contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december 31 2008 was a loss of 5 million the following table presents our open forward currency contracts as of december 31 2008 which mature in 2009 forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies in thousands the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately 996 million 

 

forward currency contracts 

 

 

a strengthening of 10 in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would on a combined basis adversely impact the translation of our nonus subsidiary net earnings and transactions on currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries by approximately 16 million for the year ended december 31 2009

 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of arrow or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the arrow acquisition 

 

the integration of arrow into our medical segment involves a number of risks and presents financial managerial and operational challenges in particular we may have difficulty and may incur unanticipated expenses related to 

 

  

the success of the arrow acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from successfully combining the businesses of arrow and of teleflex medical in the time frame we anticipate if we are not able to achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits synergies and cost savings of the business combination may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

 

failure to successfully complete the integration of arrow or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of arrow may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our inability to resolve issues related to the fda corporate warning letter issued to arrow could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  on october 11 2007 arrow received a corporate warning letter from the fda which expresses concerns with arrow’s quality systems including complaint handling corrective and preventive action process and design validation and inspection and training procedures while we are working with the fda to resolve these issues this work has required and will continue to require the dedication of significant internal and external resources there can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the fda in addition if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda we may have to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts and the fda may take further regulatory actions against us these actions may include seizing our product inventory obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products assessing civil monetary penalties or imposing a consent decree on us which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we have substantial debt obligations that could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the consideration for our acquisition of arrow as of december 31 2007 our outstanding indebtedness was approximately 17 billion we will be required to use a significant portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our indebtedness over the next few years resulting in a reduction of the cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and investments our indebtedness may also subject us to greater vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 

 

our senior credit facility and agreements with the holders of our senior notes which we refer to as our senior debt facilities impose certain operating and financial covenants that limit our ability to among other things 

 

  

in addition the terms of our senior credit facilities require us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and in the event of a significant deterioration of our economic performance we cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy those ratios a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior credit facilities if we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders under the senior credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such facilities if the lenders under the senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings and we are not able to obtain financing to satisfy this obligation we likely would have to liquidate significant assets which nevertheless may not be sufficient to repay our borrowings 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

 

although no material concentration of our manufacturing operations exists in any single country we have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states including operations conducted through entities that are not whollyowned and other alliances as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 49 of our total fixed assets and 56 of our total revenues were attributable to products directly 

  distributed from our operations outside the us our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including 

 

  

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

 

customers in our medical segment depend on third party reimbursement and the failure of healthcare programs to provide reimbursement or the reduction in levels of reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect our medical segment 

 

demand for some of our medical products is impacted by the reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers in the countries where we do business internationally medical reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the level of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for some of our medical products could be adversely impacted 

 

we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business in addition as a result of their purchasing power these payors often seek discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers our provision of such pricing concessions could negatively impact our revenues and product margins 

 

uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy legislation and regulations as well as private market practices could affect our ability to sell our products in acceptable quantities at profitable prices 

 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenue from products manufactured in and sold into nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our us dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows in order to reduce the effects of this fluctuation changes in the relative values of currencies may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

  many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities including copper and zinc although we monitor our exposure to these commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall risk management program volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

our failure to successfully develop new products could adversely affect our results 

 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products particularly in the medical device industry which is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as the inability to 

 

  

moreover we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of these intellectual property rights is important though not essential to the future success of our business in addition to relying on our patents trademarks and copyrights we rely on confidentiality agreements with employees and other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than ours or that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach confidentiality agreements misappropriate proprietary information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive harm that could adversely affect our business 

 

we depend upon relationships with physicians and other health care professionals 

 

the research and development of some of our products is dependent on our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians and other health care professionals we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding our products and the development of our products physicians assist us as researchers product consultants inventors and as public speakers if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and receive the benefits of their knowledge advice and input our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability contracts intellectual property employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us 

 

although the company carries product liability insurance we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage accordingly we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

much of our business is subject to extensive government regulation and our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations 

 

numerous national and local government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products the us food and drug administration “fda” and government agencies in other countries regulate the approval manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our medical products the us federal aviation administration and the european aviation safety agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our repair stations 

 

failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing shutdowns product shortages delays in product manufacturing product seizures recalls operating restrictions withdrawal of required licenses prohibitions against exporting of products to countries outside the united states importing products from manufacturing facilities outside the us and civil and criminal penalties including exclusion under medicaid or medicare any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis if at all resulting in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations our medical segment facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures 

 

we are also subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare pricing and fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil 

  sanctions including substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs 

 

in addition we are subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 

  

these laws and government regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover we may be subject to additional environmental claims which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet revenue or profit expectations 

 

as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully and our strategic alliances may not prove to be successful in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of services 

 

approximately 6 of our manufacturing revenues are produced by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

on october 11 2007 the company’s subsidiary arrow international inc “arrow” received a corporate warning letter from the us food and drug administration fda the letter cites three sitespecific warning letters issued by the fda in 2005 and subsequent inspections performed from june 2005 to february 2007 at arrow’s facilities in the united states the letter expresses concerns with arrow’s quality systems including complaint handling corrective and preventive action process and design validation inspection and training procedures it also advises that arrow’s corporatewide program to evaluate correct and prevent quality system issues has been deficient limitations on premarket approvals and certificates of foreign goods had previously been imposed on arrow based on prior inspections and the corporate warning letter does not impose additional sanctions that are expected to have a material financial impact on the company 

 

in connection with its acquisition of arrow completed on october 1 2007 the company has developed an integration plan that includes the commitment of significant resources to correct these previouslyidentified regulatory issues and further improve overall quality systems senior management officials from the company have met with fda representatives and a comprehensive written corrective action plan was presented to fda in late 2007 the company has begun implementing its corrective action plan which it expects to complete by the end of 2008 

 

while we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious manner there can be no assurances regarding the length of time or expenditures required to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the fda if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda we may have to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts and the fda may take further regulatory actions against us including but not limited to seizing our product inventory obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products or assessing civil monetary penalties 

 

in addition we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability intellectual property employment and environmental matters based on information currently available advice of counsel established reserves and other resources we do not believe that any such actions are likely to be individually or in the aggregate material to our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity however in the event of unexpected further developments it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters or other similar matters if unfavorable may be materially adverse to our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

various senior and term note agreements provide for the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and payment of cash dividends under the most restrictive of these provisions on an annual basis 75 million of retained earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at december 31 2007 on february 26 2008 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 032 per share on our common stock which is payable on march 17 2008 to holders of record on march 5 2008 as of february 26 2008 we had approximately 952 holders of record of our common stock 

 

on june 14 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of outstanding company common stock repurchases of company stock under the program may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and the company’s ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generation from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition under the senior loan agreements entered into october 1 2007 the company is subject to certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase shares in the event the company’s consolidated leverage ratio exceeds certain levels which further limit the company’s ability to repurchase shares under this program through december 31 2007 no shares have been purchased under this plan 

 

on july 25 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 140 million of outstanding teleflex common stock over twelve months ended july 2006 in june 2006 our board of directors extended for an additional six months until january 2007 its authorization for the repurchase of shares under the board’s authorization we repurchased a total of 2317347 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 1400 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

we have been focused on creating a portfolio of businesses that provides greater consistency of performance improved profitability and sustainable growth to accomplish this in 2007 we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to improve margins reduce cyclicality and focus our resources on the development of our core businesses 

  we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through our internal growth initiatives which include the development of new products expansion of market share moving existing products into new geographies and through selected acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development initiatives and our ability to grow market share 

 

the teleflex portfolio of businesses changed significantly in 2007 with acquisitions in all three business segments and significant divestitures in both commercial and aerospace during 2007 in our medical segment we completed the acquisition of arrow international a medical products company with annual revenues of over 500 million which significantly expanded the segment we also completed the acquisition of a small orthopedic device manufacturer to expand our capability to serve medical device manufacturers in our commercial segment we acquired a rigging services business with annual revenues of approximately 25 million at the end of the fiscal year we completed the divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses with 2007 revenues of over 860 million significantly reducing the size of our commercial segment in our aerospace segment we acquired a cargo equipment business with annual revenues of approximately 55 million and divested a precision — machined components business with approximately 130 million in revenues 

 

the following bullet points summarize our more significant acquisitions and divestitures in 2007 and 2006 and the results for the acquired businesses are included in the respective segments see notes 3 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our significant acquisitions and divestitures 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

we incurred significant indebtedness to fund a portion of the consideration for our october 2007 acquisition of arrow as of december 31 2007 our outstanding indebtedness was 17 billion up from 

  05 billion as of december 31 2006 for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see “liquidity and capital resources” below and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

results of operations 

 

discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelvemonth period 

 

the following comparisons exclude the impact of the teleflex aerospace manufacturing group “tamg” the automotive and industrial driver control motion systems and fluid handling systems business the automotive pedal systems business the sermatech international business a european medical product sterilization business and a small medical business which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note 16 for discussion of discontinued operations 

 

  

net revenues increased 14 in 2007 to 193 billion from 169 billion in 2006 entirely due to acquisitions and foreign currency movements the medical aerospace and commercial segments comprised 54 23 and 23 of our 2007 revenues respectively 

 

there was no core revenue growth in 2007 overall as compared to 2006 core growth in our aerospace segment was 7 and our medical and commercial segments declined 1 and 5 respectively year over year 

 

materials labor and other product costs as a percentage of revenues improved to 648 in 2007 from 654 in 2006 due primarily to cost and productivity improvements in our medical segment and the benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost reduction efforts which offset the negative impact from a 29 million charge related to a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which was sold during 2007 selling engineering and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 230 in 2007 compared with 222 in 2006 due primarily to approximately 7 million higher amortization expense from the arrow acquisition the 300 million writeoff of inprocess research and development costs is related to inprocess rd projects acquired in the arrow acquisition which the company believes have no alternative future use in their current state during its annual test for goodwill impairment the company determined 164 million of its goodwill attributable to its businesses that manufacture and sell auxiliary power units in the north american heavy truck and rail markets as well as components and systems for use of alternative fuels in industrial vehicles and passenger cars was impaired recent softness in certain of these markets negatively impacted the valuation of goodwill resulting in the impairment charge the remaining 25 million goodwill impairment is related to a writedown to the agreed selling price of one of the company’s variable interest entities in its commercial segment 

 

interest expense increased from 412 million to 749 million in 2007 principally as a result of higher debt levels since october 1 2007 incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition interest income increased in 2007 primarily due to higher average cash balances during the first three quarters of 2007 taxes on income from continuing operations of 1228 million in 2007 include discrete income tax charges incurred in connection with the arrow acquisition specifically in connection with funding the acquisition of arrow the company i repatriated approximately 1970 million of cash from foreign subsidiaries which had previously been deemed to be permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions and ii changed its position with respect to certain additional previously untaxed foreign earnings to treat these earnings as no longer permanently reinvested these items resulted in a discrete income tax charge in 2007 of approximately 

  918 million the effective income tax rate was 1123 in 2007 compared with 216 in 2006 the increase in the effective income tax rate primarily reflects the impact of the repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries and the change in position regarding untaxed foreign earnings minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased 57 million in 2007 due to increased profits from our entities that are not whollyowned gain on disposal of discontinued operations was 2995 million in 2007 as compared to 02 million in 2006 the significant increase was driven by the sale of tamg and the automotive and industrial businesses net income for 2007 was 1465 million compared to 1394 million for 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 7 to 373 for 2007 

 

in connection with the october 2007 acquisition of arrow the company formulated a plan related to the future integration of arrow with the company’s medical businesses the plan focuses on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing sales marketing and distribution functions in north america europe and asia costs estimated to be incurred affecting arrow employees and facilities totaling 316 million have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow while costs related to actions that affect teleflex employees and facilities will be included in restructuring and impairment charges when incurred approximately 09 million has been charged to restructuring and impairment during the fourth quarter of 2007 with an additional 2530 million expected in 2008 and 2009 a majority of which is expected to be cash outlays the company expects to realize annual savings of between 7075 million in 2010 when these integration and restructuring actions are complete 

 

in june 2006 we began certain restructuring initiatives that affected all three of our operating segments these initiatives involve the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america we took these initiatives as a means to improving operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources the charges associated with the 2006 restructuring program that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during 2007 and 2006 totaled 34 million and 30 million respectively the segment component of the 2007 charges are 53 39 and 8 attributable to our medical aerospace and commercial segments respectively the segment component of the 2006 charges are 51 37 and 12 attributable to our medical aerospace and commercial segments respectively as of december 31 2007 we expect to incur future restructuring costs associated with our 2006 restructuring program of between 10 million and 20 million in our medical segment over the next two quarters also during 2007 we determined that three minority held investments and certain fixed assets were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of 39 million which is included in restructuring and impairment charges 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2004 we announced and commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for future earnings growth the actions have included exiting or divesting noncore or low performing businesses consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services the charges including changes in estimates associated with the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program for continuing operations that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during 2007 2006 and 2005 totaled 07 million 104 million and 234 million respectively the 07 million and 104 million was attributable to our medical segment of the 234 million 87 and 13 were attributable to our medical and aerospace segments respectively as of december 31 2007 we do not expect to incur future restructuring costs associated with our 2004 restructuring and divestiture program 

 

certain 2005 costs associated with the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program are not included in restructuring and impairment charges all inventory adjustments that resulted from the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program and certain other costs associated with closing out businesses during 2005 are included in materials labor and other product costs in the aerospace segment and totaled 20 million 

 

for a more complete discussion of our restructuring programs see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

    

revenues increased 8 in 2006 to 169 billion from 156 billion in 2005 principally due to core growth the medical aerospace and commercial segments comprised 51 24 and 25 of our 2006 revenues respectively 

 

materials labor and other product costs as a percentage of revenues improved to 654 in 2006 from 669 in 2005 due primarily to the benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost reduction efforts selling engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 222 in 2006 compared with 214 in 2005 due primarily to 104 million of costs associated with the initial phases of an information systems implementation program in our medical segment 68 million of stockbased compensation expensed under sfas no 123r and various temporary inefficiencies in our medical segment during the first half of 2006 

 

on december 26 2005 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased awards made to employees based on estimated fair values sfas no 123r supersedes previous accounting under accounting principles board or apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” for periods beginning in fiscal 2006 in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin or sab no 107 providing supplemental implementation guidance for sfas 123r we have applied the provisions of sab no 107 in our adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we accounted for stockbased awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 25 as allowed under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” under the intrinsic value method no stockbased compensation expense for employee stock options had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant in accordance with the modified prospective transition method we used in adopting sfas no 123r our results of operations prior to fiscal 2006 have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of sfas no 123r as of december 31 2006 total unamortized stockbased compensation cost related to nonvested stock options net of expected forfeitures was 92 million which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 19 years additional information regarding stockbased compensation and our stock compensation plans is presented in notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

interest expense declined in 2006 principally as a result of lower debt balances interest income increased in 2006 primarily due to higher average cash balances and more favorable interest rates compared to the prior period the effective income tax rate was 216 in 2006 compared with 206 2005 the increase in the effective income tax rate primarily reflects the favorable impact in 2005 of the american jobs creation act or ajca repatriation benefit minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased 42 million in 2006 due to increased profits from our entities that are not whollyowned net income for 2006 was 1394 million compared to 1388 million for 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 3 to 349 for 2006 

 

we performed an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2006 and determined that a portion of our goodwill was impaired for which we recorded a charge of 10 million also during 2006 we determined that three minority held investments and certain fixed assets were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of 74 million which is included in restructuring and impairment charges 

  segment reviews 

 

 

 

the percentage increases or decreases in revenues during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 compared to the respective prior periods were due to the following factors 

 

 

 

the following is a discussion of our segment operating results additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

medical 

 

  

medical segment revenues increased 21 in 2007 to 10413 million from 8587 million in 2006 entirely due to acquisitions and currency movements revenues related to the acquisition of arrow international contributed 1338 million or 16 of this increase increased sales of disposable medical products for airway management respiratory care urology and surgical devices to european hospital markets and to asian hospital markets was more than offset by a decline in sales of orthopedic specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers the phase out of some product lines for medical device manufacturers and a decline in sales of products for alternate sites in north america 

 

medical segment operating profit increased 13 in 2007 to 1826 million from 1617 million in 2006 primarily due to the increase in volume from the arrow acquisition the positive impact from the full year effect of cost and productivity improvements that began in the second half of 2006 following completion of significant restructuring activities and currency movements which more than offset the negative impact from a 29 million charge in 2007 related to the fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which was sold in 2007 during the first half of 2006 operating profit was negatively impacted by costs 

  associated with operational inefficiencies and the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers operating profit as a percent of revenues decreased to 175 in 2007 from 188 in 2006 

 

assets in the medical segment increased 2419 million or 262 primarily due to acquisition of arrow in october 2007 

 

  

medical segment revenues increased 3 in 2006 to 8587 million from 8311 million in 2005 principally due to core growth the segment benefited from sales of new products in respiratory care and sleep therapy including distribution of products through alliances with other manufacturers and continued growth of diagnostic and therapeutic device products sold to medical device manufacturers offset by a decline in sales of orthopedic specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers 

 

medical segment operating profit increased 8 in 2006 to 1617 million from 1500 million in 2005 this increase primarily reflects cost and productivity improvements in the second half of the year following completion of significant restructuring activities during the first half of 2006 operating profit was negatively impacted by costs associated with operational inefficiencies and the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers we also incurred significant costs as planned in connection with the initial phases of an information systems implementation program during the first half of 2006 operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to 188 in 2006 from 180 in 2005 

 

assets in the medical segment declined 42 million or 1 primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable deferred tax assets and net property plant and equipment offset in part by the impact of the taut acquisition and the impact of currency 

 

aerospace 

 

  

aerospace segment revenues increased 11 in 2007 to 4518 million from 4054 million in 2006 this increase was due to increases of 7 from core growth 3 from acquisitions and 1 from foreign currency movements core growth was primarily attributable to increased sales of on board wide body cargo handling systems and narrow body cargo loading systems combined with steady increases in sales volume for aftermarket spares and repairs throughout the year 

 

aerospace segment operating profit increased 17 to 470 million from 402 million in 2006 as a result of higher volume productivity improvements and cost control efforts in both the cargo handling systems and engine repair businesses as well as the positive impact of restructuring in engine repair services operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to 104 in 2007 from 99 in 2006 

 

assets in the aerospace segment decreased 121 million or 5 primarily due to the sale of the teleflex aerospace manufacturing group during the second quarter of 2007 offset by the acquisition of nordisk during the fourth quarter of 2007 

 

  

aerospace segment revenues increased 11 in 2006 to 4054 million from 3668 million in 2005 this increase was due to increases of 10 from core growth and 1 from acquisitions core growth in wide body cargo handling systems and repair services was partially offset by the 65 million decrease in revenues resulting from the phase out of our industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business in 2005 

 

aerospace segment operating profit increased 51 to 402 million from 266 million in 2005 volumerelated efficiencies and additional higher margin cargo spares sales contributed to the improvement as did a reduction in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to 99 in 2006 from 73 in 2005 

  assets in the aerospace segment increased 43 million or 2 primarily due to the impact of currency 

 

commercial 

 

  

commercial segment revenues increased 3 in 2007 to 4412 million from 4268 million in 2006 the favorable impact of acquisitions and foreign currency movements and an increase in sales of products for marine markets offset a decline in core revenue growth attributable to a significant decline in sales of auxiliary power units in the north american heavy truck market and to lower sales of rigging services where unusually high demand as a result of us gulf coast rebuilding activities due to severe weather during 2006 caused unfavorable comparisons in 2007 

 

commercial segment operating profit declined 25 in 2007 to 230 million from 305 million in 2006 operating profit was negatively impacted by commodity price increases lower volumes of auxiliary power units and from approximately 4 million in provisions for warranty and other costs related to prior generation auxiliary power units sold to the north american truck market which more than offset the positive impact of cost and productivity improvements in the business serving the marine market operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to 52 in 2007 from 71 in 2006 

 

assets in the commercial segment declined 492 million or 69 primarily due to the sale of its business units that design and manufacture automotive and industrial driver controls motion systems and fluid handling systems and to the 226 million impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets 

 

  

commercial segment revenues increased 17 in 2006 to 4268 million from 3639 million in 2005 principally due to core growth the segment benefited from increased sales in 2006 of alternative fuel systems and auxiliary power units and sales of heavyduty rigging and cable used in marine construction and the securing of oil platforms resulting from rebuilding efforts in the gulf of mexico 

 

commercial segment operating profit increased 29 in 2006 to 305 million from 236 million in 2005 operating profit improvements were largely due to higher sales volumes of alternative fuel systems auxiliary power units and heavy duty rigging and cable which more than offset the negative impact of increases in commodity pricing impacting our marine products operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to 71 in 2006 from 65 in 2005 

 

assets in the commercial segment declined 111 million or 2 primarily due to the decrease in net property plant and equipment and accounts receivable offset in part by the impact of foreign currency exchange adjustments 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of 2831 million during 2007 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2007 resulted in a net cash inflow of 633 million the most significant change was a decrease in inventories of 624 million 25 million of which is due to the resolution in 2007 of operational inefficiencies experienced in the medical segment during the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers in 2005 and 2006 and focused inventory reduction initiatives in the arrow operations postacquisition and 29 million is the impact from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition which was sold during 2007 our financing activities from continuing operations during 2007 consisted primarily of new longterm borrowings of 16 billion in connection with the arrow acquisition the payment of fees of 216 million to obtain that debt and the repayment of 4634 million of debt we repaid approximately 540 million of debt in connection with the arrow acquisition and repaid approximately 3866 million of longterm debt with the proceeds from the disposal of the automotive and industrial 

  businesses our investing activities from continuing operations during 2007 consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of 22 billion of which 21 billion pertains to the acquisition of arrow international during 2007 we received proceeds of approximately 7023 million from the sale of the commercial segment’s automotive and industrial business and the aerospace segment’s precision machined components business discontinued operations generated approximately 885 million of cash flow in 2007 

 

in connection with the october 2007 acquisition of arrow the company entered into a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent bank of america na as syndication agent the guarantors party thereto the lenders party thereto and each other party thereto “the senior credit facility” the senior credit facility provides for a fiveyear term loan facility of 14 billion and a fiveyear revolving line of credit facility of 400 million both of which carry initial interest rates of libor  150 basis points the company executed an interest rate swap for 600 million of the term loan from a floating 3 month libor rate to a fixed rate of 475 the obligations under the senior credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of the material whollyowned domestic subsidiaries of the company and are secured by a pledge of the shares of certain of the company’s subsidiaries 

 

in addition the company i entered into a note purchase agreement dated as of october 1 2007 among teleflex incorporated and the several purchasers party thereto the “note purchase agreement” and issued 200000000 in new senior secured notes pursuant thereto the “2007 notes” ii amended the terms of the note purchase agreement dated july 8 2004 and the notes issued pursuant thereto the “2004 notes” and the note purchase agreement dated october 25 2002 and the notes issued pursuant thereto the “2002 notes” and together with the 2004 notes the “amended notes” and iii repaid 105 million of notes issued pursuant to the note agreements dated november 1 1992 and december 15 1993 the “retired notes” the retired notes consisted of the 740 senior notes due november 15 2007 and the 680 senior notes series b due december 15 2008 

 

the 2007 notes and the amended notes referred to collectively as the “senior notes” rank pari passu in right of repayment with the company’s obligations under the senior credit facility the “primary bank obligations” and are secured and guaranteed in the same manner as the senior credit facility jpmorgan chase bank na has been appointed as the collateral agent with respect to the collateral pledged under the senior credit facility and the senior note agreements the senior notes have mandatory prepayment requirements upon the sale of certain assets and may be accelerated upon certain events of default in each case on the same basis as the senior credit facility 

 

the interest rates payable on the amended notes were also modified in connection with the foregoing transactions effective october 1 2007 a the 2004 notes will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the following rates i 766 in respect of the series 20041 tranche a senior notes due 2011 ii 814 in respect of the series 20041 tranche b senior notes due 2014 and iii 846 in respect of the series 20041 tranche c senior notes due 2016 and b the 2002 notes will bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of 782 per annum interest rates on the amended notes are subject to reduction based on positive performance relative to financial covenants 

 

fixed rate borrowings excluding the effect of derivative instruments comprised 34 of total borrowings at december 31 2007 fixed rate borrowings including the effect of derivative instruments comprised 69 of total borrowings at december 31 2007 approximately 4 of our total borrowings of 16843 million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro 

 

the senior credit facility and the agreements with the holders of the senior notes contain covenants that among other things limit or restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur debt create liens consolidate merge or dispose of certain assets make certain investments engage in acquisitions pay dividends on repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements under the most restrictive of these provisions on an annual basis 75 million of retained earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at december 31 2007 the senior credit facility and the senior note agreements also 

  require the company to maintain certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios currently the company is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio defined in the senior credit facility as “consolidated leverage ratio” of not more than 475 to 1 and an interest coverage ratio defined in the senior credit facility as “consolidated interest coverage ratio” of not less than 3 to 1 

 

as of december 31 2007 the company was in compliance with the terms of the senior bank loan and the senior notes for additional information regarding our indebtedness please see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

in addition to the cash generated from operations we have approximately 352 million available in committed financing through the senior credit facility the availability of loans under this facility is dependent upon us maintaining our financial condition including our continued compliance with bank covenants see note 8 for further disclosure of the covenants 

 

during 2007 the company repatriated approximately 208 million of cash from its foreign subsidiaries exclusive of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of 2005 in order to take advantage of the provisions of the ajca management executed a foreign earnings repatriation plan under this plan we repatriated 304 million of dividends during november and december 2005 cash repatriated in 2006 was less than 2 million 

 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately 1985 million during 2006 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2006 resulted in a net cash inflow of 57 million the most significant change was a decrease in accounts receivable which was primarily due to improved cash collection our financing activities during 2006 consisted primarily of purchases of shares of our common stock of 936 million a reduction in longterm borrowings of 550 million a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of 599 million and payment of dividends of 441 million our investing activities during 2006 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 408 million and payments for businesses acquired of 374 million during 2006 we also made a 60 million payment in connection with a postclosing purchase price adjustment based on working capital for a divested business discontinued operations generated approximately 1143 million of cash flow 

 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately 2384 million during 2005 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2005 resulted in a net cash inflow of 673 million the most significant change was a decrease in accounts receivable which was primarily due to improved cash collection including the sale of certain receivables under a nonrecourse securitization program our financing activities during 2005 consisted primarily of a reduction of longterm borrowings of 2703 million as a result of improved cash flow the repatriation of foreign earnings and proceeds from the disposition of businesses during 2005 we also paid dividends to minority shareholders of 625 million and made purchases of shares of our common stock of 465 million our investing activities in 2005 consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of 1323 million discontinued operations contributed approximately 810 million of cash flow 

 

we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs as currently structured we sell certain trade receivables on a nonrecourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity which in turn sells interests in those receivables to a commercial paper conduit the conduit issues notes secured by those interests to third party investors the assets of the special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our obligations the total amount of accounts receivable sold to the special purpose entity were 1243 million and 1715 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the special purpose entity has received cash consideration of 397 million and 400 million for the interests in the accounts receivable it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively which amounts were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at such dates in accordance with sfas 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” 

  on june 14 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of outstanding company common stock repurchases of company stock under the program may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privatelynegotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and the company’s ability to execute on the program will depend on among other factors cash requirements for acquisitions cash generation from operations debt repayment obligations market conditions and regulatory requirements in addition under the senior loan agreements entered into october 1 2007 the company is subject to certain restrictions relating to its ability to repurchase shares in the event the company’s consolidated leverage ratio exceeds certain levels which further limit the company’s ability to repurchase shares under this program through december 31 2007 no shares have been purchased under this plan 

 

on july 25 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 140 million of our outstanding common stock over twelve months ended july 2006 in june 2006 our board of directors extended for an additional six months until january 2007 its authorization for the repurchase of shares under the board’s authorization we repurchased a total of 2317347 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 1400 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million with 1627247 shares repurchased during 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 935 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million 

 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 685 million and 505 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance increase in 2007 was primarily attributable to the recording of deferred tax assets associated with state tax loss carryforwards at full value which required a valuation allowance 

 

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

 

 

 

the increase in our percent of net debt to total capital for 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily due to new borrowings associated with the arrow acquisition 

 

we believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and meet debt obligations 

  contractual obligations at december 31 2007 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

we also have obligations with respect to income tax uncertainties and our pension and other postretirement benefit plans see notes 12 and 13 respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 

the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2007 are significantly different than at december 31 2006 due to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of arrow international in 2007 and to the divestiture of businesses in its commercial and aerospace segments in 2007 

 

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for plant and equipment the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately 19 million 

 

we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs as currently structured we sell certain trade receivables on a nonrecourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity which in turn sells interests in those receivables to a commercial paper conduit the conduit issues notes secured by those interests to third party investors the assets of the special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our obligations the total amount of accounts receivable sold to the special purpose entity were 1243 million and 1715 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively the special purpose entity has received cash consideration of 397 million and 400 million for the interests in the accounts receivable it has sold to the commercial paper conduit at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively which amounts were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at such dates in accordance with sfas 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” 

 

see also note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

  we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates based upon these judgments and estimates we record a reserve to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage our inventory reserve was 359 million and 466 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

 

  

the ability to realize longlived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount such evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

 

  

in accordance with sfas no 142 we perform an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill in addition we test our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment these impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of future performance longterm discount rates and market price valuation multiples these estimates will likely change over time several of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 25878 million and 7258 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

 

  

in connection with the acquisition of arrow international the company recorded a 30 million charge to operations during 2007 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 “business combinations” for inprocess research and development “iprd” assets acquired that the company determined had no alternative future use in their current state 

 

as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation for arrow approximately 30 million of the purchase price has been allocated to acquire inprocess research and development projects the amount allocated to the acquired inprocess research and development represents the estimated value based on riskadjusted cash flows related to inprocess projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of the acquisition the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner the company may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects 

 

the value assigned to the acquired inprocess technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value the revenue projections used to value the acquired inprocess research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product 

  introductions by us and our competitors the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales operating expenses and income taxes from such projects 

 

the rate of 14 percent utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the company’s acquisition model plus a risk premium due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects appropriate riskadjusted discount rates were used for the inprocess research and development projects the discount rates are based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased inprocess technology projects 

 

the purchased inprocess technology of arrow relates to research and development projects in the following product families central venus access catheters “cvc” and specialty care catheters “specialty care” 

 

the most significant purchased set of inprocess technologies relates to the cvc product family for which the company has estimated a value of 25 million the projects included in this product family’s inprocess technology include the hic project picc triple lumen antimicrobial picc and the elcamcatheter tip positioning technology it is anticipated that cvc inprocess technologies will begin producing revenues sometime in 2008 subject to receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals material net cash inflows net of operating costs including costs to complete clinical trials from the use of the cvc inprocess technologies are expected to commence in 2009 the estimated remaining total costs to complete these clinical trials are expected to be approximately 4 million 

 

the remaining purchased set of inprocess technologies relates to the specialty care product family for which the company has estimated a value of 5 million the projects included in this product family’s inprocess technology include the ethanol lock program and antimicrobial chdc it is anticipated that specialty care inprocess technologies will begin producing revenues sometime in 2008 subject to receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals material net cash inflows net of operating costs including costs to complete clinical trials from the use of the specialty care inprocess technologies are expected to commence in 2009 the estimated remaining total costs to complete these clinical trials are expected to be approximately 3 million to 4 million 

 

the successful development of new products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties both known and unknown including unanticipated delays access to capital budget overruns technical problems and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design development and commercialization of these new products and enhancements including for example changes requested by the fda in connection with premarket approval applications for products or 510k notification given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction there can be no assurance that any of the company’s product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget if at all the failure of the company to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm the company’s results of operations and financial condition for additional risks that may affect the company’s business and prospects following completion of the merger see “risk factors” commencing on page 12 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense a 50 basis point increase in the 

  assumed discount rate would have decreased the total net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense for 2007 by approximately 12 million and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2007 by approximately 230 million a 50 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased these amounts by approximately 15 million and 248 million respectively a 50 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would have impacted 2007 annual pension expense by approximately 10 million a 10 increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have increased the 2007 benefit expense by approximately 03 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 40 million a 10 decrease in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have decreased the 2007 benefit expense by approximately 02 million and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 35 million 

 

  

restructuring costs which include termination benefits contract termination costs and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated to exit certain contractual obligations and the timing of employees leaving the company 

 

  

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable when the collection of the full amount of the account is doubtful the allowance is based on our historical experience the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services we review the allowance periodically and adjust it as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 102 million at december 31 2007 and 101 million at december 31 2006 

 

  

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of the sales we estimate our warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors including historical trends of units sold the status of existing claims recall programs and communication with customers our estimated product warranty liability was 200 million and 141 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes and potentially litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities to the extent the final outcome differs future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities will be necessary our income taxes payable was 858 million and 161 million at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively 

 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into consideration our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and amount of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

 

we are required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions or if previously untaxed foreign earnings of the company will no longer be 

  permanently reinvested and thus become taxable in the united states as a result of the arrow acquisition we reconsidered our position with respect to recognition of deferred tax liabilities on outside basis differences including undistributed earnings relating to foreign subsidiaries as a result deferred taxes were provided in the third quarter with respect to 3015 million of undistributed foreign earnings in addition deferred taxes were provided with respect to 494 million of undistributed foreign earnings of arrow foreign subsidiaries in connection with the sale of our automotive and industrial businesses we determined that nonus proceeds from the sale totaling approximately 2677 million would also be repatriated in the foreseeable future we remain permanently reinvested with respect to the remainder of our foreign undistributed earnings 

 

significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas no 109 and in evaluating tax positions we establish additional provisions for income taxes when despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold as defined by fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement 109” “fin 48” which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority in the normal course of business the company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known

accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 

 

fair value measurements in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 sfas no 157 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to us gaap requiring use of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 

 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1572 “partial deferral of the effective date of statement 157” fsp 1572 fsp 1572 delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 157 on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

fair value option in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings at each subsequent measurement date the fair value option may be elected on an instrumentbyinstrument basis as long as it is applied to the instrument in its entirety the fair value option election is irrevocable unless an event specified in sfas no 159 occurs that results in a new election date this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 159 on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 

business combinations in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” sfas no 141r replaces fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141r retains the fundamental requirements in statement 141 that the acquisition method of accounting which statement 141 called the purchase method  be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination sfas no 141r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer 

  achieves control sfas no 141r’s scope is broader than that of statement 141 which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 

 

sfas no 141r replaces statement 141’s costallocation process and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date with limited exceptions in addition sfas no 141r changes the allocation and treatment of acquisitionrelated costs restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not obligated to incur the recognition of assets and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies and the recognition and measurement of goodwill this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and is to be applied prospectively to business combinations the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 141r on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

noncontrolling interests in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” sfas no 160 amends arb 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary sometimes referred to as minority interest and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas no 160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity but separate from the parent’s equity that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income that the changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and that when a subsidiary is deconsolidated any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 earlier adoption is prohibited the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 160 on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

  

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

 

  

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk the table below is an analysis of the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on december 31 

  2007 rates for the swaps notional amounts and related interest rates are shown by year of maturity the fair value net of tax of the interest rate swap as of december 31 2007 was a loss of 89 million 

 

 

 

 

  

a 10 change in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately 32 million for the period ended december 31 2008 

 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures these are all contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december 31 2007 was less than 01 million the following table presents our open forward currency contracts as of december 31 2007 which mature in 2008 and 2009 forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies in thousands the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately 98 million 

 

  forward currency contracts 

 

 

 

a movement of 10 in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would impact our expected net earnings by approximately 25 million

government regulation 

 

government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products and the products sold by our customers utilizing our products the us food and drug administration and government agencies in other countries regulate the approval manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products the us federal aviation administration and the european aviation safety agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some of our aerospace products and license the operation of our repair stations the us national highway traffic safety administration and government agencies in other countries regulate the manufacture and sale of many of our automotive products 

 

competition 

 

given the range and diversity of our products and markets no one competitor offers competitive products for all the markets and customers that we serve in general all of our segments and product lines face significant competition from competitors of varying sizes although the number of competitors in each market tends to be limited we believe that our competitive position depends on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineering personnel the knowhow and skill of our manufacturing personnel and the strength and scope of our sales service and distribution networks 

 

patents and trademarks 

 

we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we 

do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex brand to be essential to the operation of our business 

 

suppliers and materials 

 

materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of our products we cannot be assured of successfully passing these cost increases through to all of our customers particularly oems 

 

seasonality 

 

a portion of our revenues particularly in the commercial and medical segments are subject to seasonal fluctuations revenues in the automotive and industrial markets are generally reduced in the third quarter of each year as a result of preparations by oems for the upcoming model year in addition marine aftermarket revenues generally increase in the second quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming season incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related to disposable medical products 

 

employees 

 

we employed approximately 19800 fulltime and temporary employees at december 31 2006 of these employees approximately 7100 were employed in the united states and 12700 in countries outside of the united states less than 10 percent of our employees in the united states were covered by union contracts we have governmentmandated collectivebargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover employees in other countries we believe we have good relationships with our employees

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

we are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these risks include but are not limited to the following 

 

many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

 

although we believe that the diversified nature of our business reduces the risk that all of our operations would experience simultaneous cyclical downturns many of the businesses which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles most acutely in the automotive marine aerospace and transportation industries accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us moreover if we fail to respond promptly to changes in demand our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter 

 

we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

 

although no material concentration of our manufacturing operations exists in any single country we have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states including entities that are not whollyowned and other alliances as of december 31 2006 approximately 45 of our total assets and 57 of our total revenues were attributable to products directly distributed from our operations outside the us our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including 

 

  

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition generally 

 

our products are typically integrated into other manufacturers’ products as a result changes in demand for our customers’ products may adversely affect our revenues on short notice 

 

many of our customers in the commercial and aerospace segments including oems integrate our products into products our customers sell our customers also generally have no obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of product from us and may terminate our arrangement on short notice typically 30 to 90 days sometimes less therefore our reported backlog may not be realized as revenues revenues could 

materially decline if these customers experience a reduction in demand for their products or cancel a significant number of contracts and we cannot replace them with similar arrangements 

 

customers in our medical segment depend on third party reimbursement 

 

demand for some of our medical products is impacted by the reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers in the countries where we do business internationally medical reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the level of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers the market for some of our medical products could be adversely impacted 

 

we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business in addition as a result of their purchasing power these payors often seek discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers our provision of such pricing concessions could negatively impact our revenues and product margins 

 

uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy legislation and regulations as well as private market practices could affect our ability to sell our products in acceptable quantities at profitable prices 

 

foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenue from products manufactured in and sold into nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our reporting currency when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture our products such as the euro our us dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate although we maintain a currency hedging program to reduce the effects of this fluctuation changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations 

 

many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities including copper and zinc although we monitor our exposure to these commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall risk management program volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

our failure to successfully develop new products could adversely affect our results 

 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products including developing electronic technology to replace or improve upon mechanical technology this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as the inability to 

 

 11 

  

moreover we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of these intellectual property rights is important to the future success of our business in addition to relying on our patents trademarks and copyrights we rely on confidentiality agreements with employees and other measures to protect our knowhow and trade secrets despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us moreover there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than us or that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach confidentiality agreements misappropriate proprietary information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights our inability to protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive harm that could adversely affect our business 

 

we are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability contracts intellectual property employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict 

 

we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us 

 

we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage accordingly we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

much of our business is subject to extensive government regulation and failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

numerous national and local government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products and the products sold by our customers incorporating our products the us national highway traffic safety administration regulates the manufacture and sale of many of our automotive products the us food and drug 

administration regulates the approval manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our medical products the us federal aviation administration and the european aviation safety agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our repair stations failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing shutdowns product shortages or delays in product manufacturing 

 

we are also subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things 

 

  

these laws and government regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations moreover we may be subject to additional environmental claims which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

the costs associated with our restructuring programs may be greater than expected 

 

we are engaged in restructuring programs which require management to utilize significant estimates related to realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete and expenses for severance and other employee separation costs lease cancellation and other exit costs actual results could differ materially from those estimated due to among other things unanticipated expenditures in connection with the effectuation of the programs costs and length of time required to comply with legal requirements applicable to certain aspects of the programs inability to realize anticipated cost savings and unanticipated difficulties in connection with consolidation of manufacturing and administrative functions 

 

our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system in our medical segment may result in problems that could adversely affect us 

 

we are in the process of implementing a third party enterprise resource planning or erp system across our medical segment in an effort to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of business operations the first phase of the implementation which relates to our medical segment operations in north america is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2007 in the event we encounter any problems in the implementation of the erp system we could experience business disruptions in our medical segment which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of our medical segment management team away from daily operations in addition any delays in the implementation of the erp system could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs should we experience such difficulties our business cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

our acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet revenue or profit expectations 

 

as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances however we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully in this regard acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions 

may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of services 

 

approximately 17 of our manufacturing revenues are produced by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions it is likely that a significant portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business

various senior and term note agreements provide for the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and payment of cash dividends under the most restrictive of these provisions 148 million of retained earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at december 31 2006 on february 21 2007 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0285 per share on our common stock which is payable on march 15 2007 to holders of record on march 5 2007 as of february 15 2007 we had approximately 957 holders of record of our common stock 

 

on july 25 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 140 million of outstanding teleflex common stock over twelve months ended july 2006 in june 2006 our board of directors extended for an additional six months until january 2007 its authorization for the repurchase of shares under the approved plan we repurchased a total of 2317347 shares on the open market during 2005 and the first nine months of 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 1400 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million 

 

the following graph provides a comparison of five year cumulative total stockholder returns of teleflex common stock the standard  poor sp 500 stock index and the sp midcap 400 index we have selected the sp midcap 400 index because due to the diverse nature of our businesses we do not believe that there exists a relevant published industry or lineofbusiness index and do not believe we can reasonably identify a peer group the annual changes for the fiveyear period shown on the graph are based on the assumption that 100 had been invested in teleflex common stock and each index on december 31 2001 and that all dividends were reinvested

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through the continued development of our core businesses and carefully selected acquisitions our internal growth initiatives include the development of new products moving existing products into market adjacencies in which we already participate with other products and the expansion of market share our core revenue growth in 2006 as compared to 2005 excluding the impacts of currency acquisitions and divestitures was 5 core growth was strongest in our aerospace segment which grew 8 and weakest in our medical segment which grew 3 year over year 

 

segment operating profit increased 10 in 2006 due primarily to cost and productivity improvements in our aerospace and medical segments offset in part by a decline in our commercial segment margins 

 

on july 25 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 140 million of our outstanding common stock over twelve months ended july 2006 in june 2006 our board of directors extended for an additional six months until january 2007 its authorization for the repurchase of shares under the approved plan we repurchased a total of 2317347 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 1400 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million with 1627247 shares repurchased during 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 935 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million 

 

in november 2006 we acquired taut inc or taut a producer of instruments and devices for minimally invasive surgical procedures particularly laparoscopic surgery for 280 million the results for taut are included in our medical segment also in november 2006 we acquired ecotrans technologies inc or ecotrans a leading supplier of locomotive antiidling and emissions reduction solutions for the railroad industry for 101 million the results for ecotrans are included in our commercial segment 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

 

we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

 

  

inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates based upon these judgments and estimates we record a reserve to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage our inventory reserve was 466 million and 446 million at december 31 2006 and december 25 2005 respectively 

 

  

the ability to realize longlived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount such evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow projections the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

 

  

in accordance with sfas no 142 we perform an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill in addition we test our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment these impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of future performance longterm discount rates and market price valuation multiples these estimates will likely change over time many of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 7258 million and 7120 million at december 31 2006 and december 25 2005 respectively 

 

  

we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees including pensions and postretirement healthcare several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

 

significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense a 50 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased the total net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense for 2006 by approximately 18 million and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2006 by approximately 179 million a 50 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased these amounts by approximately 20 million and 197 million respectively a 50 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would have impacted 2006 annual pension expense by approximately 07 million a 10 increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have increased the 2006 benefit expense by approximately 03 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 27 million a 10 decrease in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have decreased the 

2006 benefit expense by approximately 01 million and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation by approximately 23 million 

 

  

restructuring costs which include termination benefits contract termination costs and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated to exit certain contractual obligations and the timing of employees leaving the company 

 

  

an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for which the collection of the full amount of accounts receivable is doubtful the allowance is based on our historical experience the period an account is outstanding the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services we review the allowance periodically and adjust it as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 101 million at both december 31 2006 and december 25 2005 

 

  

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of the sales we estimate our warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors including historical trends of units sold the status of existing claims recall programs and communication with customers our estimated product warranty liability was 141 million and 142 million at december 31 2006 and december 25 2005 respectively 

 

  

our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates we conduct a broad range of operations around the world subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions resulting at times in tax audits disputes and potentially litigation the outcome of which is uncertain management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities to the extent the final outcome differs future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities will be necessary our income taxes payable was 386 million and 462 million at december 31 2006 and december 25 2005 respectively 

 

we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into consideration our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets based on this assessment management must evaluate the need for and amount of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 

 

accounting standards issued not yet adopted 

 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued interpretation or fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin no 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin no 48 requires that the impact of a tax position be recognized in the financial statements if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on tax audit based on the technical merits of the position fin no 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of tax positions that do not meet the “more likely than not” standard classification of tax assets and liabilities interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the provisions of 

fin no 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the impact of fin no 48 on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

results of operations 

 

discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year the impact of eliminating the onemonth reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelvemonth period the following comparisons exclude the impact of the automotive pedal systems business sermatech international business european medical product sterilization business and small medical business which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations 

 

  

revenues increased 5 in 2006 to 265 billion from 251 billion in 2005 principally due to core growth the commercial medical and aerospace segments comprised 47 33 and 20 of our 2006 revenues respectively 

 

materials labor and other product costs as a percentage of revenues improved to 707 in 2006 from 718 in 2005 due primarily to the benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost reduction efforts selling engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 186 in 2006 compared with 179 in 2005 due primarily to 104 million of costs associated with the initial phases of an information systems implementation program in our medical segment 68 million of stockbased compensation expensed under sfas no 123r and various temporary inefficiencies in our medical segment during the first half of 2006 

 

interest expense declined in 2006 principally as a result of lower debt balances interest income increased in 2006 primarily due to higher average cash balances and more favorable interest rates compared to the prior period the effective income tax rate was 2472 in 2006 compared with 2299 2005 the increase in the effective income tax rate primarily reflects the favorable impact in 2005 of the american jobs creation act or ajca repatriation benefit minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased 46 million in 2006 due to increased profits from our entities that are not whollyowned net income for 2006 was 1394 million compared to 1388 million for 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 3 to 349 for 2006 

 

on december 26 2005 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased awards made to employees based on estimated fair values sfas no 123r supersedes previous accounting under accounting principles board or apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” for periods beginning in fiscal 2006 in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin or sab no 107 providing supplemental implementation guidance for sfas 123r we have applied the provisions of sab no 107 in our adoption of sfas no 123r 

 

sfas no 123r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stockbased awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods we adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application method which requires the application of the standard starting from december 26 2005 the first day of our 2006 fiscal year our consolidated financial statements for 2006 reflect the impact of sfas no 123r 

 

stockbased compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized under sfas no 123r for 2006 was 68 million and is included in selling engineering and administrative expenses the total income tax benefit recognized for sharebased compensation arrangements for 2006 was 14 million as of december 31 2006 total unamortized stockbased compensation cost related to nonvested stock options net of expected forfeitures was 92 million which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 19 years 

 

prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we accounted for stockbased awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 25 as allowed under sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” under the intrinsic value method no stockbased compensation expense for employee stock options had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant in accordance with the modified prospective transition method we used in adopting sfas no 123r our results of operations prior to fiscal 2006 have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of sfas no 123r 

 

additional information regarding stockbased compensation and our stock compensation plans is presented in notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

in june 2006 we began certain restructuring initiatives that affect all three of our operating segments these initiatives involve the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america we have determined to undertake these initiatives as a means to improving operating performance and to better leverage our existing resources the charges associated with the 2006 restructuring program that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during 2006 totaled 59 million of which 55 26 and 19 were attributable to our commercial medical and aerospace segments respectively as of december 31 2006 we expect to incur future restructuring costs associated with our 2006 restructuring program of between 30 million and 54 million in our commercial medical and aerospace segments over the next two quarters 

 

during the first quarter of 2006 we began a restructuring activity in our aerospace segment the actions relate to the closure of a manufacturing facility termination of employees and relocation of operations the charges associated with this activity that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during 2006 totaled 06 million we do not expect to incur future restructuring costs associated with this activity 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2004 we announced and commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for future earnings growth the actions have included exiting or divesting noncore or low performing businesses consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services the charges including changes in estimates associated with the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program for continuing operations that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during 2006 2005 and 2004 totaled 104 million 271 million and 676 million respectively the 104 million was attributable to our medical segment of the 271 million 13 76 and 11 were attributable to our commercial medical and aerospace segments respectively of the 676 million 31 15 and 54 were attributable to our commercial medical and aerospace segments respectively as of december 31 2006 we expect to incur future restructuring costs associated with our 2004 restructuring and divestiture program of between 16 million and 32 million in our medical segment during 2007 

 

certain costs associated with the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program are not included in restructuring and impairment charges all inventory adjustments that resulted from the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program and certain other costs associated with closing out businesses during 2005 and 2004 are included in materials labor and other product costs and totaled 20 million and 170 million respectively the 20 million in costs for 2005 related to our aerospace segment of the 170 million in costs for 2004 45 million and 125 million were attributed to our commercial and aerospace segments respectively 

 

the cost savings from our restructuring programs were lower than expected in 2006 due primarily to implementation inefficiencies in our medical segment during the first half of the year but we began to experience our anticipated rate of savings during the second half of the year 

 

for a more complete discussion of our restructuring programs see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

we performed an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2006 and determined that a portion of our goodwill was impaired we recorded a charge of 10 million which is included in restructuring and impairment charges also during 2006 we determined that three minority held investments and certain fixed assets were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of 74 million which is included in restructuring and impairment charges 

 

  

revenues increased 5 in 2005 to 251 billion from 239 billion in 2004 this increase was due to increases of 5 from core growth and 4 from acquisitions offset in part by decreases of 3 from dispositions and 1 from the impact of eliminating the onemonth reporting lag in 2004 for certain of our foreign operations the commercial medical and aerospace segments comprised 47 33 and 20 of our 2005 revenues respectively 

 

materials labor and other product costs as a percentage of revenues increased to 718 in 2005 compared with 713 in 2004 due primarily to the impact of duplicate costs and inefficiencies related to the transfer of products between facilities in the commercial segment associated with the restructuring program selling engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 179 in 2005 compared with 204 in 2004 due primarily to the continuing reduction of facilities and supporting infrastructure costs and decreased corporate expenses relative to higher revenues 

 

interest expense increased in 2005 principally from higher acquisition related debt balances in the first half of 2005 interest income increased in 2005 primarily due to higher average cash balances related to increased proceeds received from sales of businesses and assets in 2005 the effective income tax rate was 2299 in 2005 compared with 1317 in 2004 the higher rate in 2005 was primarily the result of the increase in foreign earnings for businesses located in highertaxed jurisdictions minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased 11 million in 2005 due to increased profits from our entities that are not whollyowned net income for 2005 was 1388 million an increase of 1293 million from 2004 due primarily to a 60 decrease in restructuring costs and to the gain on the sale of the sermatech business diluted earnings per share increased 315 to 339 and includes the net gain on sales of businesses and assets and the cost of restructuring and discontinued operations 

 

segment reviews 

 

the following is a discussion of our segment operating results additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

  commercial 

 

products in the commercial segment are manufactured for broad distribution as well as custom fabricated to meet individual customer needs consumer spending patterns influence the market trends for products sold to the automotive marine and certain power equipment markets 

 

automotive cable and shifter products are manufactured primarily for automotive oems discussion of marine and industrial product lines below includes the manufacturing and distribution of driver controls 

motion controls power and vehicle management systems and fuel management systems to the automotive supply marine and industrial markets 

 

  

commercial segment revenues increased 5 in 2006 to 125 billion from 119 billion in 2005 principally due to core growth the segment benefited from increased sales in 2006 of alternative fuel systems and auxiliary power systems and sales of heavyduty rigging and cable used in marine construction and the securing of oil platforms offset in part by lower volume and customer price reductions for automotive products 

 

commercial segment operating profit declined 3 in 2006 to 784 million from 811 million in 2005 operating profit improvements resulting from sales of auxiliary power units and other higher margin industrial products were more than offset by costs associated with the end of certain automotive programs mix and margin pressure associated with lower volume and customer price reductions for automotive products coupled with increases in commodity pricing operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to 63 in 2006 from 68 in 2005 

 

assets in the commercial segment declined 111 million or 2 primarily due to the decrease in net property plant and equipment and accounts receivable offset in part by the impact of currency 

 

  

commercial segment revenues declined 1 in 2005 to 119 billion from 120 billion in 2004 the segment generated an increase of 3 from core growth that was more than offset by a 4 decrease from dispositions the segment benefited from strength in its industrial oem markets the contribution of new driver controls and power and vehicle management system products and increased sales of driver and motion controls to automotive oem markets these benefits were more than offset by slower sales of products into marine and recreational markets 

 

commercial segment operating profit declined 23 in 2005 to 811 million from 1057 million in 2004 this decline primarily reflects lower volume related contributions from higher margin marine and recreational products the impact of duplicate costs and inefficiencies related to the transfer of products between two tier 2 automotive supply facilities the bankruptcy of an automotive supply customer and the impact of divestitures made in 2004 operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to 68 in 2005 from 88 in 2004 

 

assets in the commercial segment declined 1202 million or 14 primarily due to the decrease in noncurrent deferred tax assets and net property plant and equipment and the impact of currency 

 

  medical 

 

products in the medical segment generally are required to meet exacting standards of performance and have long product life cycles economic influences on revenues relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide medical devices and hospital supply market 

 

  

medical segment revenues increased 3 in 2006 to 8587 million from 8311 million in 2005 principally due to core growth the segment benefited from sales of new products in respiratory care and sleep therapy including distribution of products through alliances with other manufacturers and continued growth of diagnostic and therapeutic device products sold to medical device manufacturers offset by a decline in sales of orthopedic specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers 

 

medical segment operating profit increased 8 in 2006 to 1617 million from 1500 million in 2005 this increase primarily reflects cost and productivity improvements in the second half of the year following 

completion of significant restructuring activities during the first half of 2006 operating profit was negatively impacted by costs associated with operational inefficiencies and the consolidation of facilities and distribution centers we also incurred significant costs as planned in connection with the initial phases of an information systems implementation program during the first half of 2006 operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to 188 in 2006 from 180 in 2005 

 

assets in the medical segment declined 66 million or 1 primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable deferred tax assets and net property plant and equipment offset in part by the impact of the taut acquisition and the impact of currency 

 

  

medical segment revenues increased 13 in 2005 to 8311 million from 7364 million in 2004 this increase was due to increases of 13 from acquisitions and 3 from core growth offset in part by decreases of 2 from the impact of eliminating the onemonth reporting lag in 2004 for certain of our foreign operations and 1 from dispositions medical segment revenues increased primarily as a result of the increased sale of disposable medical products particularly related to the third quarter 2004 acquisition of hudsonrci a provider of respiratory care products sales of surgical instruments and medical devices increased primarily as a result of new product sales and volume increases for specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers 

 

medical segment operating profit increased 29 in 2005 to 1500 million from 1167 million in 2004 driven primarily by the hudsonrci acquisition and significant improvements in the core business as benefits of the restructuring program began to be recognized operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to 180 in 2005 from 158 in 2004 

 

assets in the medical segment declined 1660 million or 15 primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable including the sale of certain receivables under a nonrecourse securitization program the decrease in noncurrent deferred tax assets and the impact of currency 

 

  aerospace 

 

products and services in the aerospace segment many of which are proprietary require a high degree of engineering sophistication and are often customdesigned economic influences on these products and services relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide aerospace industry and the demand for additional air cargo capacity 

 

  

aerospace segment revenues increased 9 in 2006 to 5372 million from 4938 million in 2005 this increase was due to increases of 8 from core growth and 1 from acquisitions core growth in wide body cargo handling systems repair services and precision machined components was partially offset by the 65 million decrease in revenues resulting from the phase out of our industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business in 2005 

 

aerospace segment operating profit increased 51 to 506 million from 334 million in 2005 volumerelated efficiencies additional higher margin cargo spares sales and mix within our precisionmachined components business contributed to the improvement as did a reduction in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to 94 in 2006 from 68 in 2005 

 

assets in the aerospace segment increased 43 million or 2 primarily due to the impact of currency 

 

  

aerospace segment revenues increased 9 in 2005 to 4938 million from 4532 million in 2004 strong core growth in repair products and services and in sales of both narrowbody cargo loading systems and widebody cargo system conversions along with an increase due to a small acquisition in 2005 was partially offset by the impact of eliminating the onemonth reporting lag in 2004 for certain of our foreign operations and by the phase out and closure of industrial gas turbine aftermarket services 

 

aerospace segment operating profit increased to a profit of 334 million in 2005 from a loss of 105 million in 2004 an improvement of 439 million higher volume and improvements in precisionmachined components and the cargo systems businesses contributed to the increase as did a reduction in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial gas turbine aftermarket services operating profit loss as a percent of revenues was 68 in 2005 versus 23 in 2004 

 

assets in the aerospace segment declined 1077 million or 30 primarily due to the impact of the sale of the sermatech international business 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of 3439 million during 2006 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2006 resulted in a net cash inflow of 468 million the most significant change was a decrease in accounts receivable which was primarily due to improved cash collection our financing activities from continuing operations during 2006 consisted primarily of purchases of shares of our common stock of 936 million a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of 688 million a reduction in longterm borrowings of 550 million and payment of dividends of 441 million our investing activities from continuing operations during 2006 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 632 million and payments for businesses acquired of 417 million including a 43 million deferred payment related to a prior period acquisition during 2006 we also had proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of 80 million and made a 60 million payment in connection with a postclosing purchase price adjustment based on working capital for a divested business we had net cash provided by discontinued operations of 07 million in 2006 

 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately 3335 million during 2005 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2005 resulted in a net cash inflow of 697 million the most significant change was a decrease in accounts receivable which was primarily due to improved cash collection including the sale of certain receivables under a nonrecourse securitization program our financing activities during 2005 consisted primarily of a reduction in longterm borrowings of 2703 million and proceeds from longterm borrowings of 1092 million as a result of improved operating cash flow the repatriation of foreign earnings proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower capital spending during 2005 we also paid dividends to minority interest shareholders of 630 million and made purchases of shares of our common stock of 465 million our investing activities during 2005 consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of 1429 million during 2005 we also had capital expenditures of 699 million we had net cash used in discontinued operations of 27 million in 2005 

 

operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately 2499 million during 2004 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2004 resulted in a net cash inflow of 259 million the most significant changes were an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to increased accruals associated with the restructuring and divestiture program the decrease in inventories was the result of our focus on improved working capital management the increase in accounts receivable was largely a result of increased business levels and the hudsonrci acquisition the decrease in income taxes payable was a result of tax deductions associated with the restructuring and divestiture program for which the cash benefits were received in 2005 

our financing activities during 2004 consisted primarily of the receipt of 5116 million in gross proceeds from longterm borrowings primarily for the acquisition of hudsonrci this amount is offset by a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of 1378 million and a reduction in longterm borrowings of 779 million driven by improved operating cash flow proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower yearoveryear capital spending our investing activities during 2004 consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of 4585 million we had net cash provided by discontinued operations of 74 million in 2004 

 

we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs as currently structured we sell certain trade receivables on a nonrecourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity which in turn sells an interest in those receivables to a commercial paper conduit the conduit issues notes secured by that interest to third party investors the assets of the special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” transfers of assets under the program qualify as sales of receivables and accordingly 401 million of accounts receivable and the related amounts previously recorded in notes payable were removed from the consolidated balance sheet as of both december 31 2006 and december 25 2005 

 

on july 25 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 140 million of our outstanding common stock over twelve months ended july 2006 in june 2006 our board of directors extended for an additional six months until january 2007 its authorization for the repurchase of shares under the approved plan we repurchased a total of 2317347 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 1400 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million with 1627247 shares repurchased during 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of 935 million and aggregate fees and commissions of 01 million 

 

the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of 513 million and 326 million at december 31 2006 and december 25 2005 respectively relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance increase in 2006 was primarily attributable to the recording of deferred tax assets associated with state tax loss carryforwards at full value which required a valuation allowance 

 

in addition to the cash generated from operations we have approximately 406 million in committed and 165 million in uncommitted unused lines of credit available the availability of the lines of credit is dependent upon us maintaining our financial condition including our continued compliance with bank covenants various senior and term note agreements provide for the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and payment of cash dividends under the most restrictive of these provisions 148 million of retained earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at december 31 2006 

 

on february 21 2007 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0285 per share on our common stock which is payable on march 15 2007 to holders of record on march 5 2007 as of february 15 2007 we had approximately 957 holders of record of our common stock 

 

fixed rate borrowings excluding the effect of derivative instruments comprised 82 of total borrowings at december 31 2006 approximately 19 of our total borrowings of 5184 million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro which we believe provides a natural hedge against fluctuations in the value of assets outside the united states 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 in order to take advantage of the provisions of the ajca management executed a foreign earnings repatriation plan under this plan we repatriated 304 million of dividends during november and december 2005 

the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

 

 

 

the decline in our percent of net debt to total capital for 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the repayment of current and longterm borrowings during 2006 which was funded principally by cash generated from operations 

 

we believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and additional acquisition opportunities 

 

contractual obligations at december 31 2006 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

we also have obligations with respect to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

off balance sheet arrangements 

 

we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for plant and equipment the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately 48 million 

 

we use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs as currently structured we sell certain trade receivables on a nonrecourse basis to a 

consolidated special purpose entity which in turn sells an interest in those receivables to a commercial paper conduit the conduit issues notes secured by that interest to third party investors the assets of the special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 140 transfers of assets under the program qualify as sales of receivables and accordingly 401 million of accounts receivable and the related amounts previously recorded in notes payable were removed from the consolidated balance sheet as of both december 31 2006 and december 25 2005

  market risk 

 

we are exposed to certain financial risks specifically fluctuations in market interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent commodity prices we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 

 

  interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk the table below is an analysis of the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates of the debt portfolio for the swaps notional amounts and related interest rates are shown by year of maturity the fair value of the interest rate swaps as of december 31 2006 was 03 million 

 

 

 

a 10 increase or decrease in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately 02 million or 02 million respectively 

 

  foreign currency risk 

 

we are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december 31 2006 was 04 million the following table presents our open forward currency 

contracts as of december 31 2006 which all mature in 2007 forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies in thousands 

 

forward currency contracts

government regulation 

  government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products and the products sold by our customers utilizing our products the us food and drug administration and government agencies in other countries regulate the approval manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare products the us federal aviation administration and the european aviation safety agency regulate the manufacturing and sale of some of our aerospace products and license the operation of our repair stations the national highway traffic safety administration regulates the manufacturing and sale of numerous of our automotive products 

competition 

  given the range and diversity of our products and markets no one competitor offers competitive products for all the markets and customers that we serve in general all of our segments and product lines face significant competition from competitors of varying sizes although the number of competitors in each market tends to be limited we believe that our competitive position depends on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineering personnel the knowhow and skill of our manufacturing personnel and the strength and scope of our sales service and distribution networks 

patents and trademarks 

  we own a portfolio of patents patents pending and trademarks we also license various patents and trademarks patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks all capitalized product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by or licensed to us or our subsidiaries although these have been of value and are expected to continue to be of value in the future we do not consider any single patent or trademark except for the teleflex brand to be material to the operation of our business 

7   suppliers and materials 

  materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic locations we are not dependent on any single supplier for a substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied for our overall operations most of the materials and components we use are available from multiple sources and where practical we attempt to identify alternative suppliers volatility in commodity markets particularly steel and plastic resins can have a significant impact on the cost of producing our products we cannot be assured of successfully passing these cost increases through to all of our customers particularly oems 

seasonality 

  a portion of our revenues particularly in the commercial segment are subject to seasonal fluctuations revenue in the automotive market is generally reduced in the third quarter of each year as a result of preparations by vehicle manufacturers for the upcoming model year in addition marine aftermarket revenues generally increase in the second quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming season 

employees 

  we employed approximately 21300 fulltime and temporary employees at december 26 2004 of these employees approximately 8900 were employed in the united states and 12400 in countries outside of the united states less than 10 percent of our employees in the united states were covered by union contracts we have governmentmandated collectivebargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover employees in other countries we believe we have good relations with our employees

risk factors 

  all statements made in this annual report on form 10k other than statements of historical fact are forwardlooking statements the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “intend” “may” “plan” “will” “would” “should” “guidance” “potential” “continue” “project” “forecast” “confident” “prospects” and similar expressions typically are used to identify forwardlooking statements forward 

8   looking statements are based on the thencurrent expectations beliefs assumptions estimates and forecasts about our business and the industry and markets in which we operate these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements factors which may affect our business financial condition and operating results include changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers or suppliers including delays or cancellations in shipments demand for and market acceptance of new and existing products our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our operations realize planned synergies and operate such businesses profitably in accordance with expectations our ability to effectively execute our restructuring and divestiture program competitive market conditions and resulting effects on revenues and pricing increases in raw material costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing and global economic factors including currency exchange rates difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as interest rates more information about potential factors that could affect us is provided below we expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forwardlooking statements except as otherwise specifically stated by us 

  the costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture program may be greater than expected 

  we are engaged in a restructuring and divestiture program which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete and expenses for severance and other employee separation costs lease cancellation and other exit costs actual results could differ materially from those estimated due to among other things inability to sell businesses at prices or within timeperiods anticipated by management unanticipated expenditures in connection with the effectuation of the program costs and length of time required to comply with legal requirements applicable to certain aspects of the program and unanticipated difficulties in connection with consolidation of manufacturing and administrative functions 

  many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

  many of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles most acutely in the automotive marine aerospace and transportation industries accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us moreover if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter the diversified nature of our business reduces the risk that all of our operations would experience simultaneous cyclical downturns 

  we are subject to risks associated with our nonus operations 

  we have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states including joint ventures and other alliances as of december 26 2004 approximately 47 of our total assets and 54 of our total revenues were attributable to operations outside the us our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including 

 9   

 

   these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business results of operations and financial condition no material concentration exists in any single country 

  our products are typically integrated into other manufacturers’ products as a result changes in demand for our customers’ products may adversely affect our revenues on short notice 

  many of our customers in the commercial and our aerospace segments including oems integrate our products into products our customers sell our customers also generally have no obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of product from us and may terminate our arrangement on short notice typically 30 to 90 days sometimes less our reported backlog may not be realized as revenues and revenues could materially decline if these customers experience a reduction in demand for their products or cancel a significant number of contracts and we cannot replace them with similar arrangements 

  customers in our medical segment depend on third party reimbursement 

  sales of some of our medical products depend on the reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers in the countries where we do business internationally medical reimbursement systems vary significantly with medical centers in some countries having fixed budgets regardless of the level of patient treatment other countries require application for and approval of government or third party reimbursement without both favorable coverage determinations by and the financial support of government and third party insurers there could be an impact on the market for some of our medical products 

  we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products adverse coverage determinations or any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business in addition through their purchasing power these payors often seek discounts price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy legislation and regulations as well as private market practices could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices 

  foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

  we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we expect revenue from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues when the us dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries where we sell our products such as the euro our us dollarreported revenue and income will fluctuate changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a significant effect on our results of operations our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars our functional currency we maintain a currency hedging program to minimize the effects of this risk 

  many of our products have a significant steel and plastic resin content we also use quantities of other commodities including copper and zinc volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows we monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program 

  we depend on our ability to develop new products 

  the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products including developing electronic technology to 

10   replace or improve upon mechanical technology this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products such as the inability to identify viable new products obtain adequate intellectual property protection gain market acceptance of new products or successfully obtain regulatory approvals moreover we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

  because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of these intellectual property rights is important to the future success of our business in addition to relying on patent trademark and copyright rights we rely on unpatented proprietary knowhow and trade secrets and employ various methods including confidentiality agreements with employees to protect our knowhow and trade secrets despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the knowhow and trade secrets or develop better technology than us or that current and former employees contractors and other parties will not breach confidentiality agreements misappropriate proprietary information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights 

  we are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  we are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business these lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability contracts intellectual property employment and environmental matters the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits in addition we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies that could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to reliably predict 

  we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us 

  we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage accordingly we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims in addition if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to safety product liability warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

11     much of our business is subject to extensive regulation andor oversight by the government and failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  numerous national and local government agencies in a number of countries regulate our products and the products sold by our customers incorporating our products the national highway traffic safety administration regulates the manufacturing and sale of many of our automotive products the us food and drug administration regulates the approval manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our medical products the us federal aviation administration and the european aviation safety agency regulate the manufacturing and sale of some of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our repair stations failure to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product shortages or delays in product manufacturing 

  we are also subject to numerous foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing among other things the generation storage use and transportation of hazardous materials emissions or discharges of substances into the environment and the health and safety of our employees 

  these laws and government regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

  there is the possibility that acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet revenue andor profit expectations 

  as part of our strategy for growth we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances however there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to us we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of services 

  approximately 33 of manufacturing revenues are produced by operations for which a significant part of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements in foreign jurisdictions it is likely that a significant portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

  we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through the continued development of our core businesses and carefully selected acquisitions we fueled our acquisition growth during 2004 primarily by the third quarter acquisition of hudson respiratory care inc or hudsonrci a leading provider of disposable medical products for respiratory care and anesthesia we continue to integrate hudsonrci’s operations into our existing medical business during 2004 our results also were affected by the full year contribution from 2003 acquisitions of seven smaller businesses 

 18     our internal growth initiatives include the development of new products moving existing products into market adjacencies in which we already participate with other products and the expansion of market share our core revenue growth in 2004 as compared to 2003 excluding the impacts of currency acquisitions and divestitures was 5 

  in connection with the acquisition of hudsonrci we retired certain existing credit lines issued 350 million of senior notes at fixed interest rates ranging from 523 to 585 entered into a 400 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and amended the terms of certain existing senior notes to create a more effective and lower rate debt structure 

  in 2004 we commenced a portfolio evaluation to identify businesses for divestiture phase out or consolidation we have engaged an investment banking firm to assist us in this process and to evaluate strategic alternatives for a major portion of the businesses that were identified as nonstrategic in our evaluation process as a result of the initial evaluations we completed the divestiture of six small nonstrategic businesses during the year — four in the commercial segment one in the medical segment and one in the aerospace segment these divestitures resulted in an aggregate pretax gain of 27 million 

  on november 10 2004 we announced the initiation of a restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for earnings growth in the years ahead the planned actions include exiting or divesting of noncore or underperforming businesses consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services in connection with the restructuring and divestiture program we announced plans to actively market and divest the automotive pedal systems business for 2004 and comparable periods the automotive pedal systems business has been presented in our consolidated financial results as a discontinued operation we also announced plans to substantially exit the aftermarket services portion of the industrial gas turbine product line reported in our aerospace segment in addition we began a program to consolidate manufacturing facilities and continue to consolidate administrative functions to create shared services and further standardization of processes across the company restructuring costs were 676 million in 2004 of which 31 was commercial 15 medical and 54 aerospace all inventory adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture program and certain other costs associated with closing out businesses during the fourth quarter of 2004 are included in materials labor and other product costs and totaled 170 million in 2004 of which 45 million 0 and 125 million was attributed to our commercial medical and aerospace segments respectively 

  the weakening of the us dollar through 2003 and 2004 particularly against the euro the swedish krona the canadian dollar and the british pound had mixed impact on our reported results currency changes increased reported net revenues and net orders by 803 million and 873 million respectively in 2004 as compared to 2003 

  during 2004 we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation or fin no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” as a result we consolidated four small entities which had previously not been consolidated these entities are reported in our medical and commercial segments we also determined that it is appropriate to separately identify and reclassify for all periods presented minority interest and minority interest in equity for all of our consolidated but not whollyowned subsidiaries the minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries previously included within selling engineering and administrative expenses totaled 16534 and 16184 for 2003 and 2002 respectively the minority interest in equity of consolidated affiliates previously included within other liabilities totaled 63443 for 2003 these reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income or equity 

  during the fourth quarter of 2004 we eliminated the onemonth lag for certain of our foreign operations to coincide with the timing of reporting for all of our other operations as a result our consolidated results for 2004 include the results of those operations for the month of december 2003 and the entire twelve months of 2004 whereas our consolidated results for 2003 include the results of those operations for the month of december 2002 and the first eleven months of 2003 this change increased our consolidated revenues for 

19   2004 by 16879 and reduced our consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest for 2004 by 1114 

critical accounting estimates 

  the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 

  we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

inventory utilization 

  inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates based upon these judgments and estimates we record a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities in assessing historical usage we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 

accounting for longlived assets 

  the ability to realize longlived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount such evaluation is based on various analyses including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate as applicable the impact on the existing business the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment any impairment loss if indicated is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 

  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 142 we perform an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill in addition we test our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment these impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of future performance longterm discount notes and market price valuation multiples these estimates will likely change over time many of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 7458 million and 3869 million at december 26 2004 and december 28 2003 respectively 

accounting for restructuring costs 

  restructuring costs which include termination benefits contract termination costs asset impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs include the anticipated sales price for discontinued operations the terms that may be negotiated to exit certain contractual obligations the realizable value of certain assets associated with discontinued product lines and the timing of employees leaving the company the estimated total cost of the restructuring and divestiture actions which commenced in november 2004 is anticipated to be between 190 million and 198 million 

accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts 

  an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for which the collection of the full amount of accounts receivable is doubtful the allowance is based on our historical experience the period an account is outstand 

20   ing the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services we review the allowance periodically and adjust it as necessary our allowance for doubtful accounts was 113 million and 93 million at december 26 2004 and december 28 2003 respectively 

product warranty liability 

  most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of the sales we estimate our warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors including historical trends of units sold recourse provisions against third parties the status of existing claims recall programs and communication with customers our estimated product warranty liability was 97 million and 70 million at december 26 2004 and december 28 2003 respectively 

accounting for income taxes 

  income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items we estimate the likelihood of these actions and provide appropriate tax liabilities our income taxes payable was 119 million and 428 million at december 26 2004 and december 28 2003 respectively 

results of operations 

  discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year the impact of eliminating the onemonth reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelvemonth period the following comparisons exclude the impact of the automotive pedal systems business which has been presented in our consolidated financial results as a discontinued operation 

comparison of 2004 and 2003 

  revenues increased 15 in 2004 to 249 billion from 215 billion in 2003 this increase was due to increases of 5 from core growth 5 from acquisitions net of dispositions 4 from currency and 1 from the impact of eliminating the onemonth reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations the commercial medical and aerospace segments comprised 48 30 and 22 of our revenues respectively 

  materials labor and other product costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to 719 in 2004 compared to 724 in 2003 the decline was due to the disposition of underperforming businesses and a favorable contribution from the hudsonrci acquisition selling engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 199 in 2004 compared with 183 in 2003 due to increases relative to sales in the commercial and aerospace segments and higher corporate expenses which were impacted by the costs of compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and costs associated with the resolution of a number of legal matters 

  in 2003 we sold an investment resulting in a pretax gain of 31 million or 005 per share after tax in 2004 we sold six nonstrategic businesses resulting in a net pretax gain of 27 million or 004 per share after tax 

  interest expense increased in 2004 principally from higher debt outstanding in connection with the hudsonrci acquisition net of repayments and lower borrowing costs the effective income tax rate was 1402 in 2004 compared with 2424 in 2003 the lower rate in 2004 was primarily the result of the benefit associated with the restructuring and divestiture program net income for 2004 was 95 million a 

21   decrease of 91 from 2003 diluted net earnings per share decreased 91 to 024 and includes the cost of restructuring and discontinued operations 

  minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased 31 million in 2004 due to increased profits from our joint ventures 

  during the fourth quarter of 2004 we announced and commenced implementation of our restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for earnings growth in the years ahead the planned actions include exiting or divesting of noncore or low performing businesses consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services 

  certain costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture program are not included in restructuring costs all inventory adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture program and certain other costs associated with closing out businesses during the fourth quarter of 2004 are included in materials labor and other product costs and totaled 170 million of which 45 million 0 and 125 million was attributed to our commercial medical and aerospace segments respectively 

  for 2004 the charges associated with the restructuring and divestiture program by segment that are included in restructuring costs were as follows 

   termination benefits are comprised of severancerelated payments for all employees terminated in connection with the restructuring and divestiture program contract termination costs relate primarily to the termination of leases in conjunction with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities asset impairments relate primarily to machinery and equipment associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities as well as goodwill associated with our industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business  other restructuring costs include expenses which are directly attributable to the restructuring and divestiture program 

  as of december 26 2004 we expect to incur the following future restructuring costs in our commercial medical and aerospace segments over the next 6 quarters 

 22   comparison of 2003 and 2002 

  revenues increased 10 in 2003 to 215 billion from 196 billion resulting from gains in the commercial and medical segments which offset a decline in the aerospace segment acquisitions net of dispositions accounted for onehalf of our increase in revenue the impact of currency exchange rates provided the remainder of the revenue increase overall core growth was down slightly sales from international operations which represented 51 of our revenues increased 22 in 2003 of which 11 resulted from stronger foreign currency and 5 from acquisitions the commercial medical and aerospace segments accounted for 51 25 and 24 of our revenues respectively 

  materials labor and other product costs were 724 of revenues consistent with 2002 operating expenses increased to 183 of revenues in 2003 compared with 172 in 2002 due to increases in the medical segment and to a lesser extent the commercial and aerospace segments 

  in 2003 we sold an investment which resulted in a pretax gain of 31 million or 005 per share after tax in 2002 we sold two minor noncore businesses and also received insurance proceeds resulting in an aggregate 101 million gain or 016 per share after tax 

  interest expense increased in 2003 by 13 million largely a result of currency movement during the year as a percent of revenues interest expense decreased to 12 compared to 13 in 2002 the effective income tax rate decreased to 2424 in 2003 from 2511 in 2002 net income in 2003 decreased 13 to 1091 million from 1253 million diluted earnings per share decreased 13 from 315 in 2002 to 273 per share in 2003 

  minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased 04 million in 2003 due primarily to an increase in the medical segment 

  we closed or severely curtailed operations at 11 facilities in 2003 costs related to these consolidation efforts were 90 million of which 48 was commercial 24 medical and 28 aerospace these costs were incurred throughout the year 

segment reviews 

  the following is a discussion of our segment operating results additional information regarding our segments is presented in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

commercial 

  products in the commercial segment generally are produced in higher unit volume than those of our other two segments they are manufactured for broad distribution as well as custom fabricated to meet individual customer needs consumer spending patterns influence the market trends for products sold to the automotive and marine markets 

  automotive cable and shifter products are manufactured primarily for automotive oems discussion of marine and industrial product lines below includes the manufacturing and distribution of driver controls motion controls power and vehicle management systems and fuel management systems to the automotive supply marine and industrial markets 

comparison of 2004 and 2003 

  commercial segment revenues increased 10 in 2004 to 120 billion from 109 billion in 2003 the improvement was due to increases of 8 from core growth 4 from currency and 3 from acquisitions offset in part by a 5 decrease from dispositions revenue from driver control products sold to oem’s increased slightly in 2004 compared to 2003 with increases from currency and core growth mostly offset by 

23   a decrease from a disposition for the remainder of the segment threefourths of the revenue improvements were the result of core gains favorable currency translation provided a majority of the remaining growth and revenues from acquired entities were equivalent to the impact of dispositions 

  commercial segment operating profit declined 5 in 2004 to 1057 million from 1115 million in 2003 marine and industrial operating profit improved on volume gains which were partially offset by a cancellation of automotive alternative fuel programs in north america pricing pressure in the automotive supplier market and costs related to a new product launch operating profit in the automotive cables and shifters product line declined as a result of pricing pressure and increased raw material costs operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to 88 in 2004 from 102 in 2003 

  assets in the commercial segment increased 238 million as currency and receivable increases in european automotive cable and shifter and united states lightduty cables were tempered by the impact of business dispositions 

comparison of 2003 and 2002 

  commercial segment revenues increased 12 to 109 billion in 2003 from 9721 million in 2002 acquisitions and currency translation each added 6 in automotive cables and shifters favorable currency movements accounted for over 85 of the overall improvement as core gains in europe and asia were tempered by a decline in north america core growth outside the united states was largely the result of increased shifter and guide control products in the marine and industrial product lines revenue increased as a result of acquisitions including businesses in the power and vehicle management systems and motion controls businesses acquisitions accounted for nearly threefourths of the improvement and currency provided the remainder core revenue was relatively constant as declines in the marine aftermarket primarily fishfinders and alternative fuel systems were offset by increased sales to truck military and automotive supply markets 

  commercial segment operating profit increased 10 in 2003 to 1115 million from 1013 million due to improvement in the automotive cable and shifter product line automotive cables and shifters operating profit improved as the result of higher volume from new products and cost reductions which served to more than offset the impact of customer price reductions marine and industrial operating profit was flat as acquisitions compensated for a core business decline core business declined due to adverse mix as lower margin marine and truck products replaced higher margin aftermarket products in addition alternative fuel systems declined as a result of lower volume in part related to delays in the passage of the energy bill 

  assets in this segment increased 1939 million 44 of the increase resulted from acquisitions in the marine and industrial product lines and 37 from the impact of currency exchange rates 

medical 

  products in the medical segment generally are required to meet exacting standards of performance and have long product life cycles economic influences on revenues relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide medical devices and hospital supply market 

comparison of 2004 and 2003 

  medical segment revenues increased 40 in 2004 to 7462 million from 5347 million in 2003 this increase was due to increases of 24 from acquisitions 6 from core growth 5 from currency 3 from the impact of eliminating the onemonth reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations and 2 from the consolidation of variable interest entities in disposable medical products 59 of the growth came from the hudsonrci acquisition with currency and core improvement providing a majority of the remaining increase 

24   in surgical instruments and medical devices the cardiothoracic acquisition in the third quarter of 2003 accounted for over twothirds of the yearoveryear revenue improvement 

  medical segment operating profit increased 37 in 2004 to 1172 million from 854 million in 2003 this increase was driven largely by acquisitions and core volume gains in both the disposable medical products and surgical instruments and medical devices product lines operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to 157 in 2004 from 160 in 2003 

  assets in the medical segment increased 5213 million or 91 primarily due to the hudsonrci acquisition 

comparison of 2003 and 2002 

  in 2003 medical segment revenues increased 19 to 5347 million from 4487 million revenues gained 10 from acquisitions and 8 from the effects of stronger currencies while core growth remained relatively constant in the disposable medical products product line twothirds of the revenue increase came from stronger foreign currencies sales in the surgical instruments and medical devices product line improved substantially due to acquisitions including a cardiothoracic devices business in 2003 

  operating profit increased 18 in 2003 to 854 million compared with 723 million in 2002 the increase in operating profit was comprised of equal contributions from disposable medical products volume and currency and acquisitions in the surgical instruments and medical devices product line overall operating profit as a percent of revenues declined as an improvement in the disposable medical products product line from volume gains was more than offset by a decline in surgical instruments and medical devices as a result of the acquisition 

  assets increased 701 million or 14 the cardiothoracic devices acquisition accounted for 75 of the increase 

aerospace 

  products and services in the aerospace segment many of which are proprietary require a high degree of engineering sophistication and are often customdesigned economic influences on these products and services relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide aerospace industry and to demand for power generation 

comparison of 2004 and 2003 

  aerospace segment revenues increased 2 in 2004 to 5383 million from 5286 million in 2003 this increase was due to increases of 2 from currency and 1 from the impact of eliminating the onemonth reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations offset in part by a 1 decrease from dispositions core growth was the result of doubledigit growth in repair products and services and precisionmachined components which more than compensated for declines in industrial gas turbine or igt and cargohandling systems core revenue growth was in part due to increased sales of lower margin offerings 

  aerospace segment operating profit declined 168 in 2004 to a loss of 63 million from a profit of 92 million in 2003 operating profit declined due primarily to onetime charges in igt related to our restructuring and divestiture program pricing pressures from the aerospace oems and aftermarket and higher costs in precisionmachined components operating profit loss as a percent of revenues was 12 in 2004 versus 17 in 2003 

  assets in the aerospace segment declined 723 million or 16 due substantially to the phaseout of the igt business 

25   comparison of 2003 and 2002 

  in 2003 aerospace segment revenues decreased 2 to 5286 million from 5421 million in 2002 core products declined by 4 while currency contributed a positive 2 sales declined due to weaker end markets in the igt product line and to a lesser extent the cargohandling systems and precisionmachined components product lines these declines were tempered by an increase in repair products and services revenues brought about by higher sales of low margin material product offerings 

  operating profit declined 73 from 342 million in 2002 to 92 million in 2003 while operating profit as a percent of revenues fell to 17 from 63 in the prior year a significant portion of the decline was attributable to the igt product line which declined due to lower volume major investments in new parts development and contract losses in the engineering services business results in cargohandling systems and precisionmachined components were adversely impacted by volume declines and continued pricing pressures margins of repair products and services declined due to the unfavorable product mix 

  in 2003 assets increased 110 million or 2 due substantially to currency fluctuations 

liquidity and capital resources 

  operating activities provided net cash of approximately 2545 million during 2004 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2004 resulted in a net cash inflow of 139 million the most significant changes were an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to increased accruals associated with the restructuring and divestiture program the decrease in inventories was the result of our focus on improved working capital management the increase in accounts receivable was largely a result of increased business levels and the hudsonrci acquisition the decrease in income taxes payable was a result of tax deductions associated with the restructuring and divestiture program for which the cash benefits will be received in 2005 our financing activities during 2004 consisted primarily of the receipt of 5116 million in gross proceeds from longterm borrowings primarily for the acquisition of hudsonrci this amount is offset by a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of 1378 million and a reduction in longterm borrowings of 779 million driven by improved operating cash flow proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower yearoveryear capital spending our investing activities during 2004 consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of 4585 million we had net cash used in discontinued operations of 70 million in 2004 see the “interest rate risk” section of item 7a on page 28 for additional information regarding interest rates and borrowings 

  operating activities provided net cash of approximately 2251 million during 2003 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2003 resulted in a net cash outflow of 178 million the most significant change was an increase in accounts receivable offset in part by an increase in income taxes payable accounts receivable growth was in line with volume improvement as accounts receivable as a percentage of fourth quarter revenues remained flat our financing activities during 2003 consisted primarily of a reduction in longterm borrowings of 375 million offset in part by an increase in notes payable and current borrowings of 351 million during 2003 we also paid 309 million in dividends our investing activities during 2003 consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of 852 million and capital expenditures of 804 million we had net cash used in discontinued operations of 232 million in 2003 

  operating activities provided net cash of approximately 1982 million during 2002 changes in our operating assets and liabilities during 2002 resulted in a net cash outflow of 295 million the most significant change was an increase in inventory offset in part by an increase in income taxes payable inventory increased in connection with new widebody cargohandling systems repair products and services programs and igt aftermarket parts products our financing activities during 2002 consisted primarily of 

26   reductions of 746 million in notes payable and current borrowings and 342 million in longterm borrowings offset in part by the receipt of 530 million in gross proceeds from longterm borrowings during 2002 we also paid 279 million in dividends our investing activities during 2002 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of 806 million and payments for businesses acquired of 572 million we had net cash used in discontinued operations of 22 million in 2002 

  in addition to the cash generated from operations we have approximately 285 million in committed and 115 million in uncommitted unused lines of credit available the availability of the lines of credit is dependent upon us maintaining our strong financial condition including our continued compliance with bank covenants various senior note agreements provide for the maintenance of ratios and limit the payment of cash dividends under the most restrictive of these provisions 240 million of retained earnings was available for dividends at december 26 2004 

  fixed rate borrowings comprised 60 of total borrowings at december 26 2004 approximately 29 of our total borrowings of 788 million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar principally the euro providing a natural hedge against fluctuations in the value of assets outside the united states 

  the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio 

   the increase in our percent of net debt to total capital for 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily due to additional borrowings used to acquire hudsonrci 

  we believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements capital expenditures and additional acquisition opportunities 

27     contractual obligations at december 26 2004 are as follows 

  

 off balance sheet arrangements 

  we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for plant and equipment the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately 11 million see also note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

28   variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates of the debt portfolio for the swaps notional amounts and related interest rates are shown by year of maturity 

 foreign currency risk 

  we are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures the following table presents the significant cash flows and fair values of our open forward currency contracts as of december 26 2004 which all mature in 2005 

   forward contracts are expressed in local currency amounts the market value of the total exchange gain is 2865 

  additional risk is incurred as a result of the translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into us dollars a movement of 10 in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would impact our expected net earnings by approximately 14 million

item 1  business

     teleflex incorporated the company was incorporated in 1943 as a
manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft
from this original single market single product orientation the company began
to emphasize products and services in a broader range of economically diverse
markets to reduce its vulnerability to economic cycles since the mid1970s the
companys investments have been directed toward specific market niches employing
its technical capabilities to provide solutions to specific engineering problems
and toward expanding into medical businesses the continuing stream of new
products and valueadded product improvements that have resulted from this
strategy have enabled the company to participate in larger market segments
several of these new products and product improvements were developed by means
of an unusual investment program of the company called the new venture fund
established in 1972 the fund directs monies representing onehalf percent of
sales into the development of new products and services this concept allows for
entrepreneurial risk taking in new areas by encouraging innovation and
competition among the companys managers for funds to pursue new programs and
activities independent of their operating budgets examples of new venture
projects include the funding of second generation adjustable pedal research
flexible fuel hose and most of the early seed money for certain medical
products

item 1  business

     teleflex incorporated the company was incorporated in 1943 as a
manufacturer of precision mechanical pushpull controls for military aircraft
from this original single market single product orientation the company began
to emphasize products and services in a broader range of economically diverse
markets to reduce its vulnerability to economic cycles since the mid1970s the
companys investments have been directed toward specific market niches employing
its technical capabilities to provide solutions to specific engineering problems
and toward expanding into medical businesses the continuing stream of new
products and valueadded product improvements that have resulted from this
strategy have enabled the company to participate in larger market segments
several of these new products and product improvements were developed by means
of an unusual investment program of the company called the new venture fund
established in 1972 the fund directs monies representing onehalf percent of
sales into the development of new products and services this concept allows for
entrepreneurial risk taking in new areas by encouraging innovation and
competition among the companys managers for funds to pursue new programs and
activities independent of their operating budgets examples of new venture
projects include the funding of second generation adjustable pedal research
flexible fuel hose and most of the early seed money for certain medical
products

     the companys business is separated into three business
segments  commercial medical and aerospace

commercial segment

     the commercial segment designs and manufactures proprietary mechanical and
electrical controls for the automotive market mechanical electrical and
hydraulic controls and electronic products for the pleasure marine market and
proprietary products for fluid transfer and industrial applications products in
the commercial segment generally are less complex and are produced in higher
unit volume than that of the companys other two segments they are manufactured
for general distribution as well as custom fabricated to meet individual
customer needs consumer spending patterns generally influence the market trends
for these products the commercial segment consists of three major product
lines automotive marine and industrial

     the company is a major supplier of driver control systems to automotive
manufacturers worldwide the principal products in this market are automatic and
manual transmission gearshift systems mechanical and electronic throttle
systems complete pedal box systems including adjustable pedals and various
release cables general stampings and flexible fluoropolymer hoses in may 1997
the company acquired comcorp technologies inc a supplier of pedal assemblies
and other automotive components and systems in december 1997 the company
acquired united parts group nv a european manufacturer of gearshift systems
and other components supplying most of the european auto and truck makers the
truck systems division of united parts was sold in february 1998 the remaining
driver control division with five manufacturing plants throughout europe
expanded the companys entrance into the european automotive market the
acquisitions of both comcorp and united parts are part of the companys strategy
to integrate cable controls with other automotive components in order to provide
systems solutions for customers acceptance by the automobile manufacturers of a
companydeveloped control for use on a new model ordinarily assures the company
a large but not exclusive market share for the supply of that control in
2000 the company acquired a tier i supplier of natural gas propane and
hydrogen components and systems to the alternative fuel vehicle market

     the company is a leading domestic producer of mechanical steering systems
for pleasure power boats it also manufactures hydraulic steering systems
engine throttle and shift controls electrical gauges and instrumentation

     for the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing
form s8 effective july 13 1990 under the securities act of 1933 the
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows which undertaking shall be
incorporated by reference into registrants registration statements on form s8

     insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act
of 1933 and is therefore unenforceable in the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action suit or
proceeding is asserted by such director officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered the registrant will unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue
