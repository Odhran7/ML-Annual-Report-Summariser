businesses spend an estimated 125 trillion each year with other businesses in many instances they lack the proper tools to monitor what is being purchased and employ manual paperbased disparate processes and methods to both approve and make payments for their purchases this often results in wasted time and money due to unnecessary or unauthorized spending fraud receipt collection data input and consolidation report generation reimbursement processing account reconciliations employee disciplinary actions and more 

digital payments are faster and more secure than paperbased methods such as checks and provide timely and detailed data which can be utilized to effectively reduce unauthorized purchases and fraud automate data entry and reporting and eliminate reimbursement processes combining this payment data with analytical tools delivers powerful insights which managers can use to better run their businesses 

fleetcor’s vision is that every payment is digital every purchase is controlled and every related decision is informed our wide range of modern digitized solutions generally provides control reporting and automation benefits superior to many of the payment methods businesses often used such as cash paper checks general purpose credit cards as well as employee pay and reclaim processes in addition to delivering meaningful value to our customers our solutions also share several important and attractive business model characteristics such as 

• the majority of revenue is derived primarily from businesses that are customers which tend to have relatively predictable consistent volumes 

• recurring revenue models driven by recurring volume resulting in predictable revenue 

• similar businesstobusiness b2b selling systems with common sales approaches management and reporting 

• specialized technology platforms and proprietary payment acceptance networks which create competitive advantages and barriers to entry and 

• high ebitda margins and cash flow translation given limited infrastructure investment requirements 

we are executing on a strategy of optimizing assets leveraging similar selling methods and bundling and crossselling valueadded solutions we continue to enhance our solutions to displace disjointed payment methods improve customers’ mobile and digital experiences and extend utility we actively market and sell to current and prospective customers leveraging a multichannel gotomarket approach which includes comprehensive digital channels direct sales forces and strategic partner relationships we supplement our organic growth strategy and sales efforts by pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities which serve to strengthen and extend our market positions and create value even faster with a long proven operating history fleetcor now serves hundreds of thousands of business customers with millions of cardholders making payments to millions of vendors around the world 

fleetcor has three reportable segments north america international and brazil we report these three segments as they reflect how we organize and manage our global employee base manage operating performance contemplate the differing regulatory environments across geographies and help us isolate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our financial results however to help facilitate an understanding of our expansive range of solutions around the world we describe them in two categories expense management solutions which help control and monitor employee spending and corporate payments solutions which simplify and automate vendor payments 

expense management 

our expense management solutions are purposebuilt to provide customers with greater control and visibility of employee spending when compared with less specialized payment methods such as cash or generalpurpose credit cards our proprietary processing and card management solutions provide customers with significant capabilities including customizable userlevel controls detailed transaction reporting programmable alerts configurable networks contract price validation and audit and tax management and reporting our customers can use these data controls and tools to combat fraud and employee misuse streamline expense administration and potentially lower their operating costs 

we utilize both proprietary and thirdparty payment acceptance networks to deliver our expense management solutions in our proprietary networks which tend to be geographically distinct transactions are processed on applications and operating systems owned and operated by us and only at select participating merchants with whom we have contracted directly for acceptance these proprietary networks generally provide us with better economics as we control more of the transaction and richer data 

because of how the networks and point of sale software are configured thirdparty networks are operated by independent parties and tend to be more broadly accepted which is the primary benefit compared with our proprietary networks mastercard and visa are our primary thirdparty network partners in north america and europe respectively 

fuel 

we offer fuel solutions to businesses and government entities who operate vehicle fleets at the most basic level we provide the measurement of fuel used and facilitate the payment for that fuel to the merchant whether that fuel be diesel gasoline compressed natural gas or electricity 

the measurement and payment needs of our customers operating electric vehicles ev are similar to those operating traditional internal combustion vehicles just centered around electricity usage instead of gas or diesel usage as we help our customers manage through the transition to evs we expect many of them to operate mixed fleets and will need access to networks of fuel stations electric charging stations both on the road and at the office in addition to athome charging options considering the increased complexity of managing a mixed fleet or an all ev fleet we believe the value of our solutions will endure regardless of the propulsion method 

we utilize both proprietary and thirdparty networks to deliver our fuel solutions our proprietary fuel networks are geographically distinct and may also be unique to specific markets we serve such as highwaybased truck stops with high speed diesel pumps that can quickly refuel longhaul diesel trucks we are actively expanding our proprietary networks in ev including investing in ev partner companies to accommodate ev charging in the us uk and europe many of our fuel solutions also have additional purchasing capabilities as part of our beyond fuel program we can enable the fuel card to allow customers to purchase nonfuel items such as oil vehicle maintenance supplies and services and building supplies but with more control than a generalpurpose credit card 

we also provide program management services to major oil companies leasing companies and fuel marketers which allow these partners to outsource the sales marketing credit service and system operations of their branded fuel card portfolios our fuel partners include british petroleum bp arco speedway and caseys and over 650 fuel marketers of all sizes 

lodging

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to information technology and security 

we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems telecommunications data centers and call centers including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to provide reliable service to customers cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data centers and call centers as well as thirdparty labor and services providers our business involves processing large numbers of transactions the movement of large sums of money and the management of large amounts of data we rely on the ability of our employees contractors suppliers systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure uninterrupted and errorfree manner 

our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors such as power availability telecommunications carrier redundancy embargoes and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries 

we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data however there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown security breach or catastrophic event such as fire explosion flood pandemic natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure or physical breakin we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of proprietary and thirdparty processing systems a system outage could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations including by damaging our reputation or exposing us to thirdparty liability to successfully operate our business we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption including from events that may be beyond our control events that could cause system interruptions include fire natural disaster unauthorized entry power loss telecommunications failure computer viruses terrorist acts and war although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures 

our solutions are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that are constantly evolving we often encounter delays and cost overruns in developing changes implemented to our systems in addition the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation or exposure to liability claims in addition we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation of liability provisions in our licenses and other agreements with our customers we cannot assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

we may not be able to adequately protect our systems or the data we collect from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information social security numbers expense data and credit card debit card and checking account numbers we endeavor to keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

other than a previously disclosed unauthorized access incident during the second quarter of 2018 we are not aware of any material breach of our or our associated third parties’ computer systems although we and others in our industry are regularly the subject of attempts by bad actors to gain unauthorized access to these computer systems and data or to obtain change or destroy confidential data including personal consumer information of individuals through a variety of means 

because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our systems and the data we collect change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure computer viruses can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 

we could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws for example we are subject to a variety of us and international statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries while we believe we are in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations if we were ever found to be in violation our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to security and privacy that we impose on our service providers who have access to customer and consumer data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data in addition we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of customer data the costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures as well as the cost of deploying additional personnel training our employees and hiring outside experts may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability protracted and costly litigation governmental and card network intervention and fines remediation costs and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers lost revenue and reputational harm while we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and such insurance may not be available for renewal on acceptable terms or at all and in any event insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident 

in addition under payment network rules regulatory requirements and related obligations we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties such as thirdparty service providers vendors partners and others which we refer to collectively as associated participants the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions and could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our solutions are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of regulators and our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing selling or encouraging adoption of new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position similarly if new technologies are developed that displace our traditional payment card as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses we may be unsuccessful in adequately responding to customer practices and our transaction volume may decline in addition we regularly engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products services and underlying technology which may or may not be successful in achieving broad acceptance or their intended purposes 

the solutions we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions all at high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we may rely on third parties to develop or codevelop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms or at all and these relationships may not be successful in addition partners some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties 

risks related to our business and operations 

the extent to which the outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 the continuing spread of its variants and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict 

the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 and its variants have spread throughout the globe and have negatively impacted the macroeconomic environment significantly increasing economic uncertainty the outbreak has resulted in regulatory and other authorities periodically implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and business shutdowns as well as uncertainty regarding the scope or enforceability of vaccine mandates in certain jurisdictions these measures have negatively impacted consumer and business spending and could continue to do so in addition these measures have adversely impacted and may further impact our ability or the cost and expense incurred by us to attract retain and develop our workforce or otherwise impact our operations and the operations or workforces of our customers suppliers and business partners these measures may remain in place or return as applicable for significant periods of time and they are likely to continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the spread of the coronavirus previously caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and subject to variations in infection levels in various jurisdictions we may take renewed or further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners while vaccines are currently being administered around the world vaccine availability the distribution of vaccines efficacy to new strains of the virus and the publics willingness to get vaccinated or receive booster doses could limit their impact and extend the duration of the pandemic we continue to manage the business as appropriate in order to preserve our financial flexibility during this challenging time there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities 

in addition any ongoing impact of covid19 on macroeconomic conditions may impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates inflation and increasing commodity prices including fuel prices interest rates and the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the global supply chain even after the covid19 global pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future the continued disruption of global financial markets as a result of the covid19 global pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future 

the extent to which the covid19 outbreak impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact through vaccines or otherwise and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the coronavirus outbreak has subsided we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future 

there are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of the coronavirus and a global pandemic and as a result the ultimate impact of the covid19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy as a whole however the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations 

adverse effects on payment card transaction volume including from unfavorable macroeconomic conditions weather conditions natural catastrophes or public health crises or from changes to business purchasing practices could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers accordingly our operating results could be adversely impacted by events or trends that negatively impact the demand for fuel businessrelated products and services or payment card services in general 

for example our transaction volume is generally correlated with general economic conditions and levels of spending particularly in the us europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the related amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other businessrelated products and services by our customers similarly prolonged adverse weather events travel bans due to medical quarantine such as the recent responses to the covid19 pandemic or in response to natural catastrophes especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions could adversely affect our transaction volumes likewise recent political investor and industry focus on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may adversely affect the volume of transactions or business operations of the oil companies merchants and truck stop owners with whom we maintain strategic relationships which could adversely impact our business in such event we may not be able to successfully execute our ev strategy which could further adversely impact our business 

in addition our transaction volumes could be adversely affected if businesses do not continue to use or fail to increase their use of credit debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions similarly our transaction volumes could be impacted by adverse developments in the payments industry such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business or a wellpublicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not creditworthy or are fraudulently completed changes in our industry customer demand and in relation to our fuel customers movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result could lead to increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment including economic weakness caused by largescale crises like the covid19 pandemic we may experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers additionally the counterparties to the derivative financial instruments that we use in our international payments provider business to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in foreign exchange rates may fail to honor their obligations which could expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate this risk includes the exposure generated when we write derivative contracts to our customers as part of our crosscurrency payments business and we typically hedge the net exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties if a customer becomes insolvent files for bankruptcy commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with such counterparties for the derivatives or may bear financial risk for those receivables where we have offered trade credit if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 our bad debt expense was 379 million and 1585 million or 3 bps and 15 bps of total billings respectively 

any decrease in our receipt of fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card solutions include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments revenues for late fees and finance charges represent 4 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity or the extent to which they use optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our solutions is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer our primary competitors in the north american fuel solutions are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers corporate payments solutions faces a variety of competitors some of which have greater financial resources name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services competitors in the lodging solution include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of fleet cards and vouchers for food fuel tolls and transportation and major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers who offer commercial fleet cards 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service payment terms account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources than we do in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers such as treasury management commercial lending and credit card processing which allow them to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships sometimes at a discount if 

price competition continues to intensify we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers decrease the prices of our solutions or lose customers each of which could adversely affect our operating results in fuel solutions major oil companies petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuel card services as a complement to their existing or complementary card products and services to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business if their fuel card products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into lower cost sales packages with other widely utilized nonfuel card related products and services 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings we must continually and quickly update our services a process that could result in higher costs and the loss of revenues earnings and customers if the new services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 

the payments technology industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in a number of projects including the development of new platforms mobile payment applications ecommerce services and other new offerings emerging in the payments technology industry including particularly with respect to electric vehicles these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance problems in the payments technology markets these risks are even more acute any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services could render our services less desirable to customers or possibly even obsolete 

a decline in retail fuel prices or contraction in fuel price spreads could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

we believe during the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 12 of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel approximately 5 of our consolidated revenue during the year ended december 31 2021 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuel price spreads when our fleet customers purchase fuel certain arrangements in our fuel solutions generate revenue as a percentage of the fuel transaction purchase amount and other arrangements generate revenue based on fuel price spreads the fuel price that we charge to any fuel customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices the significant volatility in fuel prices can impact these revenues by lowering total fuel transaction purchase amounts and tightening fuel price spreads we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fuel customers or the fuel price we charge to our fuel customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel the volatility is due to many factors outside our control including new oil production or production slowdowns supply and demand for oil and gas and market expectations of future supply and demand political conditions actions by opec and other major oil producing countries speculative trading government regulation weather and general economic conditions when such volatility leads to a decline in retail fuel prices or a contraction of fuel price spreads our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected 

the value of certain of our solutions depend in part on relationships with oil companies fuel and lodging merchants truck stop operators airlines and sales channels to grow our business the failure to maintain and grow existing relationships or establish new relationships could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the success and growth of our solutions depend on the wide acceptability of such cards when our customers need to use them as a result the success of these solutions is in part dependent on our ability to maintain relationships with major oil companies petroleum marketers closedloop fuel and lodging merchants truck stop operators airlines and sales channels each of whom we refer to as our “partners” and to enter into additional relationships or expand existing arrangements to increase the acceptability of our payment cards these relationships vary in length from one to eight years for oil companies to one to two years for merchants and may be renegotiated at the end of their respective terms due to the highly competitive and at times exclusive nature of these relationships we often must participate in a competitive bidding process to establish or continue the relationships such bidding processes may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing which may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships 

if the various partners with whom we maintain relationships experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise are forced to contract their operations our solutions could be adversely impacted similarly because some of our solutions are marketed under the brands of major oil companies certain other adverse events outside our control like those companies’ failure to maintain their brands or a decrease in the size of their branded networks may adversely affect our ability to grow our revenue 

the loss of failure to continue or failure to establish new relationships or the weakness or decrease in size of companies with whom we maintain relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and adversely affect our solutions and operating results 

we must comply with various rules and requirements including the payment of fees of mastercard and our sponsor banks in order to remain registered to participate in the mastercard networks 

a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the us and canada registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive even if we pursue sponsorship by alternative member banks similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist  in addition mastercard routinely updates and modifies its membership requirements changes in such requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services if we do not comply with mastercard requirements it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registration which allows us to process transactions on its networks the termination of our registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the us and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future 

our crossborder solution depends on our relationships with banks and other financial institutions around the world which may impose fees restrictions and compliance burdens on us that make our operations more difficult or expensive 

in our crossborder solution we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions primarily crossborder crosscurrency transactions for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations increased regulation and compliance requirements are impacting these businesses by making it more costly for us to provide our solutions or by making it more cumbersome for businesses to do business with us any factors that increase the cost of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical such as trade policy including restrictions arising out of the russian and ukrainian conflict or higher tariffs could negatively impact our revenues and harm our business we may also have difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships needed to conduct our services due to banks’ policies 

increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors customers and our employees with respect to our environmental social and governance esg practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks 

there is increased focus including from governmental organizations investors employees and clients on esg issues such as environmental stewardship climate change diversity and inclusion racial justice and workplace conduct negative public perception adverse publicity or negative comments in social media could damage our reputation if we do not or are not perceived to adequately address these issues any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us in addition organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries 

maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our business relationships and operating results 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our solutions from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets even if these activities increase our revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 37 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound brazilian real canadian dollar russian ruble mexican peso czech koruna euro australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income in addition a majority of the revenue from our international payments provider business is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments this solution also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

our expansion through acquisitions may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating or integration difficulties or increased costs and dilution to our stockholders and we may never realize the anticipated benefits 

we have been an active acquirer in the us and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall portfolio of solutions customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties delays and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business all of which may divert resources and management attention otherwise available to grow our existing portfolio in addition acquisitions may expose us to geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience present difficulties in retaining the customers of the acquired business and present difficulties and expenses associated with new regulatory requirements competition controls or investigations 

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including difficulty managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities difficulty integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds languages and organizational cultures difficulty and expense introducing our corporate policies or controls and increased expense to comply with foreign regulatory requirements applicable to acquisitions 

integration of acquisitions could also result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing operations or inconsistencies on our services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results 

to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

our business in foreign countries may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the us 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for customers in more than 150 countries throughout north america south america europe africa oceania and asia we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various additional countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate such as russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the us in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet revenues from nonus operations or in the 

interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our portfolio operating results and financial condition 

specifically the current conflict between russia and ukraine is creating substantial uncertainty about the role russia will play in the global economy in the future countries across the globe are instituting sanctions and other penalties against russia – and those sanctions and penalties are evolving almost daily we are unable to predict the impact sanctions will have on the global economy also the recent exit of the uk from the european union often referred to as brexit may create significant administrative burdens and additional compliance costs for our european operations by interrupting or effectively terminating ukbased licenses that we hold to conduct financial transactions within the european union the uncertainty surrounding these events could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products globally 

in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other political economic technological operational and regulatory risks and difficulties that we do not generally face in the us these risks and difficulties could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment solutions 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment solutions we do not maintain insurance to protect us against such losses we bear similar risk relating to fraudulent acts of employees or contractors for which we maintain insurance however the conditions or limits of coverage may be insufficient to protect us against such losses 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft a single significant incident of fraud or increases in the overall level of fraud involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment solutions and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions including significant monetary fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our payment solutions results are subject to seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income 

our fuel and payroll card solutions are typically subject to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and profit which are impacted during the first and fourth quarter each year by the weather holidays in the us christmas being celebrated in russia in january and lower business levels in brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration our gift solutions are typically subject to seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns historically gift revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season 

risks related to our intellectual property 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the us in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed 

furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we may agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

finally we use open source software in connection with our technology and services companies that incorporate open source software into their products from time to time face claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software open source software is also provided without warranty and may therefore include bugs security vulnerabilities or other defects for which we have no recourse or recovery some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software andor make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost while we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related technology or service such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive especially in certain fields including information technology and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

risks related to regulatory matters and litigation 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the us and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to government regulations covering a number of different areas including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements licensing and registration requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security privacy and data breach requirements identity theft protection programs and aml compliance programs while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures and regulators continue to consider whether to include business customers especially smaller business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the bsa by the financial crimes enforcement network fincen and must comply with applicable aml requirements including implementation of an effective aml program our business in canada is also subject to the pcmltfa which is a corollary to the bsa changes in this regulatory environment 

including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business 

as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs in addition our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state banking authorities and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us or alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

many of these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly with increasing frequency federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training monitoring and compliance including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and appropriate manner we may be subject to injunctions other sanctions or the payment of fines and penalties and our reputation may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

for more information about laws regulations and enforcement activities that may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate see “business regulatory” 

derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities as well as impact how we conduct our business within our international payments provider operations 

rules adopted under the doddfrank act by the cftc provisions of the european market infrastructure regulation and its technical standards as well as derivative reporting in canada and the us have subjected certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer to our customers as part of our crossborder solutions to reporting record keeping and other requirements additionally certain foreign exchange derivatives transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing requirements or may be subject to margin requirements in the us uk and european union or other jurisdictions 

our compliance with these requirements has resulted and may continue to result in additional costs to our business and may impact our international payments provider business operations furthermore our failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines and other sanctions as well as necessitate a temporary or permanent cessation to some or all of our derivative related activities any such fines sanctions or limitations on our business could adversely affect our operations and financial results additionally the regulatory regimes for derivatives in the us uk and european union such as under the doddfrank act and the markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii are continuing to evolve and changes to such regimes our designation under such regimes or the implementation of new rules under such regimes such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs to our business other jurisdictions outside the us uk and the european union are considering have implemented or are implementing regulations similar to those described above and these may result in greater costs to us as well 

governmental regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services 

governmental bodies in the us and abroad have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations restricting the transfer of and requiring safeguarding of nonpublic personal information for example in the us all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to help protect the privacy and security of consumer financial information in connection with providing services to our clients we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks our sponsor banks and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer information these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer personal information received from our customers our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level or internationally our compliance costs may increase our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

legislation and regulation of greenhouse gases “ghg” and related divestment and other efforts could adversely affect our business 

we are aware of the increasing focus of local state regional national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues legislation to regulate ghg emissions has periodically been introduced in the us congress and there has been a wideranging policy debate both in the us and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation several states and geographic regions in the us have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of ghgs additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions the epa andor any international agreements to which the us may become a party that control or limit ghg emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our partners’ and merchants’ operations and therefore ours see “our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results” and “if we are unable to maintain and expand our merchant relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected” because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil industry existing or future laws or regulations related to ghgs and climate change including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for fuel in such event we may not be able to successfully execute our electric vehicle strategy which could further adversely affect our business 

in addition to the regulatory efforts described above there have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves if these efforts are successful our ability to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively impacted 

members of the investment community have recently increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry including practices related to ghgs and climate change an increasing percentage of the investment community considers sustainability factors in making investment decisions and an increasing number of our partners and merchants consider sustainability factors in awarding work if we are unable to successfully address sustainability enhancement we may lose partners or merchants our stock price may be negatively impacted our reputation may be negatively affected and it may be more difficult for us to effectively compete 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor material adverse effects on our business 

we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of our operations including employmentrelated disputes contract disputes intellectual property disputes government inquiries investigations audits and regulatory proceedings customer disputes and tort claims responding to proceedings may be difficult and expensive and we may not prevail in some proceedings the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief which if granted would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings regardless of whether we prevail or not such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations further these types of matters could divert our management’s attention and other resources away from our businessin addition from time to time we have had and expect to continue to receive inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business any potential claims or any such inquiries or potential claims have resulted in and may continue to result in various audits reviews and investigations which can be time consuming and expensive these types of inquiries audits reviews and investigations could result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties various forms of injunctive relief and redress changes in personnel and increased review and scrutiny by customers regulatory authorities the media and others which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

failure to comply with the fcpa aml regulations economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws and regulations applicable to our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the fcpa the uk bribery act canada’s pcmltfa and australia’s amlctf act these laws and regulations generally prohibit and our employees consultants and agents from bribing being bribed or making 

other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate these laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible 

in addition we are subject to aml laws and regulations including the bsa among other things the bsa requires money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased aml programs verify the identity of our customers report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations other group entities may be subject to additional foreign or local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions 

similar aml and counterterrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations 

violations of these laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting likewise any investigation of any potential violations of these laws and regulations by us or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and operating results in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws and regulations might be administered or interpreted 

risks related to our debt 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2021 we had approximately 60 billion of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

• we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations under our debt facilities and if we fail to satisfy these obligations an event of default could result 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for acquisitions working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate activities see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsmaterial cash requirements and uses of cash” 

• covenants relating to our debt may limit our ability to enter into certain contracts pay dividends or to obtain additional financing for acquisitions working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate activities including to react to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate 

• events outside our control including volatility in the credit markets or a significant rise in fuel prices may make it difficult to renew our securitization facility on terms acceptable to us and limit our ability to timely fund our working capital needs 

• we may be more vulnerable than our less leveraged competitors to the impact of economic downturns and adverse developments in the industry in which we operate and 

• we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are subject to variable or floating rates of interest 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including through our securitization facility although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

the transition away from the london interbank offered rate libor benchmark interest rate and the adoption of alternative benchmark reference rates could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the majority of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor we have entered into hedging instruments to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate the last of which expires in december 2023 effective january 1 2022 the publication of libor on a representative basis ceased for the oneweek and twomonth usd libor settings and all sterling yen euros and swiss franc libor settings all other remaining usd libor settings will cease july 1 2023 in connection with the sunset of certain libor reference rates occurring at the end of 2021 we have amended the credit agreement to provide for a transition from libor to the sterling overnight index average reference rate “sonia” plus a sonia adjustment of 00326 for sterling borrowings the euro interbank offered rate “euribor” for euro borrowings and the tokyo interbank offer rate “tibor” for yen borrowings we continue to monitor developments related to the upcoming transition from usd libor to an alternative benchmark reference rate after june 30 2023 the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to usd libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 at this time the effects of the phase out of usd libor and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined a failure to properly transition away from usd libor could adversely affect the company’s borrowing costs or expose the company to various financial operational and regulatory risks which could affect the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 55 of our total assets at december 31 2021 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions which may increase in the future in connection with new acquisitions under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings which could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition

executive overview 

fleetcor is a leading global provider of digital payment solutions that enables businesses to control purchases and make payments more effectively and efficiently since its incorporation in 2000 fleetcor has continued to deliver on its mission to provide businesses with “a better way to pay” fleetcor has been a member of the sp 500 since 2018 and trades on the new york stock e xchange under the ticker flt 

businesses spend an estimated 125 trillion each year with other businesses in many instances they lack the proper tools to monitor what is being purchased and employ manual paperbased disparate processes and methods to both approve and make payments for their purchases this often results in wasted time and money due to unnecessary or unauthorized spending fraud receipt collection data input and consolidation report generation reimbursement processing account reconciliations employee disciplinary actions and more 

fleetcor’s vision is that every payment is digital every purchase is controlled and every related decision is informed digital payments are faster and more secure than paperbased methods such as checks and provide timely and detailed data which can be utilized to effectively reduce unauthorized purchases and fraud automate data entry and reporting and eliminate reimbursement processes combining this payment data with analytical tools delivers powerful insights which managers can use to better run their businesses our wide range of modern digitized solutions generally provides control reporting and automation benefits superior to many of the payment methods businesses often used such as cash paper checks general purpose credit cards as well as employee pay and reclaim processes 

our revenue is generally reported net of the cost for underlying products and services purchased through our payment products in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue see “results of operations” for additional segment information 

impact of covid19 on our business 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus including variants thereof covid19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity the operations of our suppliers vendors and customers and on our employees as a result of quarantines vaccine mandates facility closures travel and logistics restrictions and general decreases in the level of consumer confidence and business activity in 2020 our operations were negatively impacted by a significant decrease in the level of business activity across industries worldwide which reduced the volume of payment services provided to our customers and revenue generated beginning during the second half of march 2020 and continuing through early 2021 in 2021 as described in more detail under “results of operations” below we experienced a rebound in transaction volumes as the business recovered from the effects of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of incremental new sales particularly as a result of the favorable impact of fuel prices and foreign exchange rates 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact various aspects of the world economy and our customers the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations financial results and liquidity into 2022 will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess including the duration and scope of the pandemic and the geographies most affected vaccine availability globally the distribution of the vaccines efficacy to new strains of the virus and the publics willingness to get vaccinated or receive booster doses including potential disruptions impacting our suppliers and vendors resulting directly or indirectly from vaccine mandates andor vaccine hesitancy our response to the continued impact of the pandemic the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and general economic activity including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and business spending levels its impact on our ability or the cost and expense incurred by us to successfully attract retain and develop our workforce its short and longerterm impact on the levels of consumer confidence the ability of our suppliers vendors and customers to successfully address the continued impacts of the pandemic and actions governments businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic and how quickly economies recover after the pandemic subsides

we generate revenue in our fuel solutions through a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and charges as well as from interchange these fees may be charged as fixed amounts costs plus a markup based on a percentage of the transaction purchase amounts or a combination thereof our programs also include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk 

in our corporate payments solutions the primary measure of volume is spend the dollar amount of payments processed on behalf of customers through our various networks we primarily earn revenue from the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the third party for a given transaction as interchange or spread revenue our programs may also charge fixed fees for access to the network and ancillary services provided 

in our tolls solution the relevant measure of volume is average monthly tags active during the period we primarily earn revenue from fixed fees for access to the network and ancillary services provided we also earn interchange on certain nontoll products 

in our lodging solutions we primarily earn revenue from the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the hotel for a given transaction and commissions paid by hotels we may also charge fees for access to the network and ancillary services provided 

in our gift solutions we primarily earn revenue from the processing of gift card transactions sold by our customers to end users as well as from the sale of the plastic cards we may also charge fixed fees for ancillary services provided

the following table provides revenue per key performance metric by solution category as reported and organically for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 in millions except revenues net per key performance metric 





organic revenue growth is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of operating performance organic revenue growth is calculated as revenue growth in the current period adjusted for the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment to include fuel price fuel price spreads and changes in foreign exchange rates over revenue in the comparable prior period adjusted to include or remove the impact of acquisitions andor divestitures and nonrecurring items that have occurred subsequent to that period see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures” for more information and a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap we believe that organic revenue growth on a macroneutral onetime item and consistent acquisitiondivestiturenonrecurring item basis is useful to investors for understanding the performance of fleetcor 

revenue per relevant key performance indicator kpi which may include transaction spend volume monthly tags room nights or other metrics is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and the overall macroeconomic environment including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and fuel price spreads revenue per kpi per customer may change as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases as macroeconomic factors change and as 

adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates see “results of operations” for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction 

sources of expenses 

we incur expenses in the following categories   

• processing —our processing expense consists of expenses related to processing transactions servicing our customers and merchants credit losses and cost of goods sold related to our hardware and card sales in certain businesses 

• selling —our selling expenses consist primarily of wages benefits sales commissions other than merchant commissions and related expenses for our sales marketing and account management personnel and activities 

• general and administrative —our general and administrative expenses include compensation and related expenses including stockbased compensation for our executives finance and accounting information technology human resources legal and other administrative personnel also included are facilities expenses thirdparty professional services fees travel and entertainment expenses and other corporatelevel expenses 

• depreciation and amortization —our depreciation expenses include depreciation of property and equipment consisting of computer hardware and software including proprietary software development amortization expense cardreading equipment furniture fixtures vehicles and buildings and leasehold improvements related to office space our amortization expenses include amortization of intangible assets related to customer and vendor relationships trade names and trademarks software and noncompete agreements we are amortizing intangible assets related to business acquisitions and certain private label contracts associated with the purchase of accounts receivable 

• other operating net —our other operating net includes other operating expenses and income items that do not relate to our core operations or that occur infrequently 

• investment gain loss net —our investment results primarily relate to impairment charges related to our investments and unrealized gains and losses related to a noncontrolling interest in a marketable security which was disposed in 2020 

• other expense income net —our other expense income net includes gains or losses from the sale of assets foreign currency transactions and other miscellaneous operating costs and revenue 

• interest expense net —our interest expense net includes interest expense on our outstanding debt interest income on our cash balances and interest on our interest rate swaps 

• provision for income taxes —our provision for income taxes consists of corporate income taxes related primarily to profits resulting from the sale of our products and services on a global basis 

factors and trends impacting our business 

we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance   

• global economic conditions —our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally in north america brazil and internationally including the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic factors affected by the economy include our transaction volumes the credit risk of our customers and changes in tax laws across the globe these factors affected our businesses in each of our segments 

• foreign currency changes —our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates namely by movements of the australian dollar brazilian real british pound canadian dollar czech koruna euro mexican peso new zealand dollar and russian ruble relative to the us dollar approximately 63 and 61 of our revenue in 2021 and 2020 respectively was derived in us dollars and was not affected by foreign currency exchange rates see “results of operations” for information related to foreign currency impact on our total revenue net 

our crossborder foreign currency trading business aggregates foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts and economically hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties these contracts are subject to counterparty credit risk 

• fuel prices —our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a change in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease or increase in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts we believe approximately 12 and 11 of revenues net were directly impacted by changes in fuel price in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

• fuel price spread volatility —a portion of our revenue involves transactions where we derive revenue from fuel price spreads which is the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant for the same transaction in these transactions the price paid to the merchant is based on the wholesale cost of fuel the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors 

described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel the inverse of these situations produces fuel price spread expansion we believe approximately 5 and 8 of revenues net were directly impacted by fuel price spreads in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

• acquisitions —since 2002 we have completed over 90 acquisitions of companies in addition to commercial account portfolios acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy and it is our intention to continue to seek opportunities to increase our customer base and diversify our service offering through further strategic acquisitions the impact of acquisitions has and may continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations and may make it difficult to compare our results between periods 

• interest rates —our results of operations are affected by interest rates we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt on january 22 2019 we entered into three swap contracts the objective of these swap contracts is to reduce the variability of cash flows in the previously unhedged interest payments associated with 20 billion of variable rate debt the sole source of which is due to changes in the libor benchmark interest rate for each of these swap contracts we pay a fixed monthly rate and receive one month libor the 10 billion interest rate swap matured in january 2022 

• expenses —over the long term we expect that our general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue increases to support our expected revenue growth we plan to continue to incur additional sales and marketing expense by investing in our direct marketing thirdparty agents internet marketing telemarketing and field sales force 

• taxes —we pay taxes in various taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in certain nonus taxing jurisdictions are different than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates

• in february 2022 we made two immaterial investments in an electric vehicle charging payments business and an electric vehicle data analytics business

processing processing expenses were 5598 million in 2021 a decrease of 365 million or 61 from 5964 million in 2020 the decrease in processing expenses was due to lower bad debt expense of approximately 121 million which included a writeoff of a customer receivable in our crossborder business of approximately 90 million in the first quarter of 2020the remaining change in processing expense included incremental expenses of 48 million related to higher volumes processed and incremental expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2021 of approximately 36 million

the average unused facility fee for the credit facility excluding the revolving d facility was 030 and 029 in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

on january 22 2019 we entered into three interest rate swap contracts the objective of these interest rate swap contracts is to reduce the variability of cash flows in the previously unhedged interest payments associated with 2 billion of variable rate debt tied to the one month libor benchmark interest rate during 2021 as a result of these swaps we incurred additional interest expense of approximately 50 million or 246 over the average libor rates on 2 billion of borrowings in january 2022 10 billion of our interest rate swaps matured

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness make acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios repurchase shares of our common stock and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

sources of liquidity we believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and securitization facility each defined below together with expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future based on our current assumptions at december 31 2021 we had approximately 26 billion in total liquidity consisting of approximately 11 billion available under our credit facility defined below and unrestricted cash of 15 billion restricted cash primarily represents customer deposits in our comdata business in the us as well as collateral received from customers for crosscurrency transactions in our crossborder payments business which are restricted from use other than to repay customer deposits as well as secure and settle crosscurrency transactions 

we also utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic receivables to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants before collecting the receivable as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions at december 31 2021 we had no additional liquidity under our securitization facility 

the company has determined that outside basis differences associated with our investment in foreign subsidiaries would not result in a material deferred tax liability and consistent with our assertion that these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested have not recorded incremental income taxes for the additional outside basis differences 

we cannot assure you that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will remain accurate due to the unprecedented nature and unpredictability of the ongoing covid19 global pandemic as a consequence our estimates of the duration of the pandemic and the severity of the impact on our future earnings and cash flows could change and have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

  

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 11971 million in 2021 a decrease from 14726 million in 2020 the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to unfavorable working capital movements due to the timing of cash receipts and payments in 2021 over 2020 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 7159 million in 2021 an increase from 1062 million in 2020 the increased use of cash was primarily due to incremental cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 over 2020 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was 3439 million in 2021 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 14168 million in 2020 the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased net borrowings on our credit facility of 1702 million and increased net borrowings on our securitization facility of 689 million which were partially offset by an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock of 506 million in 2021 over 2020 

capital spending summary 

our capital expenditures were 1115 million in 2021 an increase of 331 million or 422 from 784 million in 2020 the increased size of the business due to acquisitions as well as continued investments in technology resulted in an increase in capital spending

stock repurchase program 

given the company’s returns on its capital investments and significant cash provided by operations management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders over time through stock repurchases the companys board of directors the board has approved a stock repurchase program as updated from time to time the program authorizing the company to repurchase its common stock from time to time until february 1 2023 on july 27 2021 the b oard increased the aggregate size of the program by 10 billion to 51 billion since the beginning of the program through december 31 2021 20068498 shares have been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of 44 billion leaving the company up to 07 billion available under the program for future repurchases in shares of its common stock there were 5451556 common shares totaling 14 billion in 2021 3497285 common shares totaling 9408 million in 2020 and 2211866 common shares totaling 6368 million in 2019 repurchas ed under the program 

on january 25 2022 the board increased the aggregate size of the program by 10 billion to 61 billion in january and february 2022 1510027 shares were repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of 3608 million of which 1066015 shares with an aggregate purchase price of 2565 million were repurchased pursuant to a 10b51 plan as of march 1 2022 the company has up to 13 billion available under the program for future repurchases of its common stock 

any stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as deemed appropriate the timing and amount of stock repurchases if any will depend on a variety of factors including the stock price market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements and any additional constraints related to material inside information the company may possess any repurchases have been and are expected to be funded by a combination of available cash flow from the business working capital and debt 

critical accounting policies and estimates adoption of new accounting standards and pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote on page 59 of this form 10k for additional information 

revenue recognition and presentation we provide payment solutions to our business merchant consumer and payment network customers our payment solutions are primarily focused on specific commercial spend categories including corporate payments fuel lodging tolls as well as gift solutions stored value cards and ecards we provide solutions that help businesses of all sizes control simplify and secure payment of various domestic and crossborder payables using specialized payment products we also provide other payment solutions for fleet maintenance employee benefits and long haul transportationrelated services 

payment services 

our primary performance obligation for the majority of our payment solutions corporate payments fuel lodging and gift among others is to standready to provide authorization and processing services payment services for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions and the consideration received is contingent upon the customer’s use eg number of transactions submitted and processed of the related payment services accordingly the total transaction price is variable payment services involve a series of distinct daily services that are substantially the same with the same pattern of transfer to the customer as a result we allocate and recognize variable consideration in the period we have the contractual right to invoice the customer for the tolls payment solution our primary performance obligation is to standready each month to provide access to the toll network and process toll transactions each period of access is determined to be distinct and substantially the same as the customer benefits over the period of access in our crossborder payments business the majority of revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enables customers to make crosscurrency payments 

gift card products and services 

our gift solutions deliver both stored value cards and ecards cards and cardbased services primarily in the form of gift cards to retailers these activities each represent performance obligations that are separate and distinct revenue for stored valued cards is recognized gross of the underlying cost of the related card recorded in processing expenses within the consolidated statements of income at the point in time when control passes to our customer which is generally upon shipment 

other 

we account for revenue from late fees and finance charges in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations primarily in the us and canada in accordance with asc 310 receivables such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed and services are provided we cease billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 30  40 days after the customer’s balance becomes delinquent 

in addition in our crossborder payments business we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments in foreign currencies the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year we aggregate our foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including forwards options and spot exchanges of currency as necessary and economically hedge the net currency risks by entering into offsetting derivatives with established financial institution counterparties the changes in fair value related to these instruments are recorded in revenues net in the consolidated statements of income 

refer to the revenue footnote on page 66 of this form 10k for additional information 

financial instrumentscredit losses our current expected credit loss methodology for measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis replaces the previous incurred loss impairment methodology our financial assets subject to credit losses are primarily trade receivables we utilize a combination of aging and lossrate methods to develop an estimate of current expected credit losses depending on the nature and risk profile of the underlying asset pool based on product size of customer and historical losses expected credit losses are estimated based upon an assessment of risk characteristics historical payment experience and the age of outstanding receivables adjusted for forwardlooking economic conditions the allowances for remaining financial assets measured at amortized cost basis are evaluated based on underlying financial condition credit history and current and forwardlooking economic conditions the estimation process for expected credit losses includes consideration of qualitative and quantitative risk factors associated with the age of asset balances expected timing of payment contract terms and conditions changes in specific customer risk profiles or mix of customers geographic risk economic trends and relevant environmental factors refer to the financial instrumentscredit losses section in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote on page 60 of this form 10k for additional information 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived assets we complete an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level we first perform a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required we then perform the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies estimates critical to our evaluation of goodwill for impairment include forecasts for revenues net and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda growth and longterm growth rates as well as the discount rates if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment loss is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

refer to the impairment of longlived assets intangibles and investments section in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote on page 60 of this form 10k and the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote on page 76 of this form 10k for additional information 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the 

enactment date we have elected to treat the global intangible low taxed income gilti inclusion as a current period expense 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribe thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense refer to the income taxes footnote on page 81 of this form 10k for additional information 

business combinations business combinations completed by us have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents goodwill the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the transaction 

the estimates we use to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets the estimated fair values of customerrelated and contractbased intangible assets are generally determined using the income approach which is based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows the discount rates used represented a risk adjusted market participant weightedaverage cost of capital derived using customary market metrics these measures of fair value also require considerable judgments about future events including forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted customer attrition rates contract renewal estimates and technology changes acquired technologies are generally valued using the replacement cost method which requires us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence trademarks and trade names are generally valued using the relieffromroyalty approach this method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weightedaverage cost of capital this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statements of income we also estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the period over which to recognize the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible assets as an expense certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate refer to the acquisitions footnote on pages 73 of this form 10k for additional information and the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote 76 of this form 10k for additional information 

stock based compensation we routinely grant employee stock options and restricted stock awardsunits as part of employee compensation plans stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to five years and vesting is generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions or a combination of these we use the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units generally have vesting provisions of one to four years and vesting is generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions or a combination of these the fair value of restricted stock where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock units granted with market based vesting conditions is estimated using the monte carlo simulation valuation model stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years over which the requisite service is expected to be rendered for performancebased and restricted stock awardsunits and performancebased stock option awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected refer to the stock based compensation section in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote on page 63 of this form 10k and stock based compensation footnote on page 70 of this form 10k for additional information 

material cash requirements and uses of cash 

material cash requirements primarily consist of debt obligations and related interest payments along with lease obligations refer to the debt footnote on page 78 and leases footnote on page 83 of this form 10k for more information the company estimates interest payments for our interest rate swap cash flow contracts the swap contracts using the fixed interest rate on each swap less the one month libor rate in effect on our term loans at december 31 2021 are expected to be 265 million and 127 million in 2022 and 2023 respectively 

deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31 2021 were approximately 5644 million refer to income taxes footnote on page 81 of this form 10k for more information deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods as a result scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading as this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs at december 31 2021 we had approximately 470 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions we cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled we do not expect reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties 

management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stock based compensation expense related to share based compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs discounts and intangible assets amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment c integration and deal related costs and d other nonrecurring items including unusual credit losses occurring largely due to covid19 the impact of discrete tax items impairment charges asset writeoffs restructuring costs gains due to disposition of assetsbusinesses loss on extinguishment of debt and legal settlements 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash share based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and share based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from our adjusted net income we also believe that integration and deal related costs and onetime nonrecurring expenses gains losses and impairment charges do not necessarily reflect how our investments and business are performing we adjust net income for the tax effect of each of these nontax items adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income net income per diluted share or cash flow from operations as determined by us generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies 

organic revenue growth is calculated as revenue growth in the current period adjusted for the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment to include fuel price fuel price spreads and changes in foreign exchange rates over revenue in the comparable prior period adjusted to include or remove the impact of acquisitions andor divestitures and nonrecurring items that have occurred subsequent to that period we believe that organic revenue growth on a macroneutral onetime item and consistent acquisitiondivestiturenonrecurring item basis is useful to investors for understanding the performance of fleetcor 

management uses adjusted net income adjusted net income per diluted share and organic revenue growth 

• as measurements of operating performance because they assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis 

• for planning purposes including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget 

• to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business and 

• to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies 

reconciliation of nongaap revenue and key performance metric by solution to gaap  set forth below is a reconciliation of organic growth by component calculated using pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenue net and transactions in millions 



reconciliation of nongaap organic growth by segment to gaap  set forth below is a reconciliation of organic growth by segment calculated using pro forma and macro adjusted revenue to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenue net and transactions in millions 





reconciliation of nongaap measures  set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

  






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

foreign earnings 

our international businesses expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenues from our international businesses were 370 386 and 398 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2021 were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2021 by approximately 480 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2020 and 2019 were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 by approximately 424 million and 477 million respectively we have utilized international and brazil segment operating income as a proxy for foreign earnings 

unhedged crosscurrency risk 

with our crossborder payment solutions we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our crossborder payments provider business the majority of crossborder payments revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments in our crossborder payment solutions we also write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year we aggregate foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including the derivative contracts described above and hedge economic hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates on our cash investments and on the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2021 we had 49 billion of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit agreement see note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about the credit agreement we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to changes in interest rates in january 2019 we entered into three interest rate swap cash flow contracts with us dollar notional amounts of 1 billion with a fixed rate of 256 500 million with a fixed rate of 256 and 500 million with a fixed rate of 255 maturing on january 31 2022 january 31 2023 and december 19 2023 respectively for each of these swap contracts we will receive one month libor while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highlyeffective cash flow hedges under us gaap see note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about the swap contracts 

if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points and assuming we had an outstanding balance on our credit facility and term loans of 29 billion not fixed by interest rate swap contracts at december 31 2021 our interest expense would have changed by approximately 290 million based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2020 and 2019 if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense would have changed by approximately 160 million and 202 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuel price spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction for certain of our payment products the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the 

merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuel price spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price

businesses spend an estimated 170 trillion each year in many instances they lack the proper tools to monitor what is being purchased and employ manual paperbased disparate processes and methods to both approve and make payments for their purchases this often results in wasted time and money due to unnecessary or unauthorized spending fraud receipt collection data input and consolidation report generation reimbursement processing account reconciliations employee disciplinary actions and more 

fleetcor’s vision is that every payment is digital every purchase is controlled and every related decision is informed digital payments are faster and more secure than paperbased methods such as checks and provide timely and detailed data which can be utilized to effectively reduce unauthorized purchases and fraud automate data entry and reporting and eliminate reimbursement processes combining this payment data with analytical tools delivers powerful insights which managers can use to better run their businesses 

our wide range of modern digitized solutions generally provides control reporting and automation benefits superior to many of the payment methods businesses often used such as cash paper checks general purpose credit cards as well as employee pay and reclaim processes in addition to delivering meaningful value to our customers our solutions also share several important and attractive business model characteristics such as 

• customers are primarily businesses which tend to have relatively predictable consistent volumes 

• recurring revenue models driven by recurring volume resulting in predictable revenue 

• similar businesstobusiness b2b selling systems with common sales approaches management and reporting 

• specialized technology platforms and proprietary payment acceptance networks which create competitive advantages and barriers to entry and 

• high ebitda margins and cash flow translation given limited infrastructure investment requirements 

we are executing on a strategy of optimizing assets leveraging similar selling methods and bundling and crossselling valueadded solutions we continue to enhance our solutions to displace inferior payment methods improve customers’ mobile and digital experiences and extend utility we actively market and sell to current and prospective customers leveraging a multichannel gotomarket approach which includes direct sales forces comprehensive digital channels and strategic partner relationships we supplement our organic growth strategy and sales efforts by pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities which serve to strengthen or extend our market positions and create value even faster with a long proven operating history fleetcor now serves hundreds of thousands of business customers with millions of cardholders making payments to millions of vendors around the world 

fleetcor has three reportable segments north america international and brazil we report these three segments as they reflect how we organize and manage our global employee base manage operating performance contemplate the differing regulatory environments across geographies and help us isolate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our financial results however to help facilitate an understanding of our expansive range of solutions around the world we describe them in two categories corporate payments solutions which simplify and automate payments and expense management solutions which help control and monitor employee spending 

corporate payments 

our corporate payments solutions are designed to help businesses streamline the backoffice operations associated with making outgoing payments companies save time cut costs and manage b2b payment processing more efficiently with our suite of corporate payment solutions including accounts payable ap automation virtual cards crossborder and purchasing and te cards 

ap automation – we offer ap automation solutions with options that are purposebuilt for the simplest small business to the most complex large enterprise we initiate manage and guarantee payment of all companyapproved bills to all domestic and international vendors through whichever payment modalities the vendors allow such as automated clearing house ach wire check or payment card for smallmedium sized businesses smb our offering is simple modern bill pay with invoice scanning and automated workflows which also syncs to popular accounting systems like quickbooks tm  our midmarketenterprise option meets the needs of the most complex global enterprises with multiple organizational hierarchies approval workflows locations bank accounts robust ondemand reporting and seamless integration with enterprise resource planning 

table of contents 

erp systems we also provide rich data on the remittance to the supplier regardless of payment modality which facilitates invoice reconciliations and payment posting by automating the process of paying vendors businesses of all sizes can reduce the time costs and fraud risks associated with their payment processes and refocus on operating their businesses 

virtual card – virtual card provides a singleuse card number for a specific amount usable within a defined timeframe virtual cards provide enhanced security relative to checks while reducing total payment costs for our customers full remittance data accompanies each virtual card payment providing significant reconciliation advantages to ach payments we have integrated our virtual card offering into most leading erp systems providing a seamless experience for ap personnel 

we have built a proprietary merchant acceptance network which we believe is largest in the industry that accepts our virtual card payments our merchant acceptance network is unique from all others due to the nature of commercial virtual card acceptance so other issuers’ virtual cards are not interchangeable this network is managed with proprietary technology that allows us to continuously expand virtual card acceptance and optimize the amount of spend we can capture the scale of this network coupled with a bestinclass inhouse vendor enrollment service is a competitive advantage our erp integrations application programming interface api capabilities strategic vendor enrollment and transaction management tools enable us to optimize our customers’ electronic payables programs 

our virtual card operates solely on the mastercard network our customers’ erp systems are directly integrated with our issuing system and merchants must be enrolled in our proprietary vendor network to accept our virtual card solution this twosided transaction where both payor and receiver are both in our network provides substantial payment security relative to paper checks or ach 

crossborder – our crossborder solution is used by our customers to pay international suppliers foreign office and personnel expenses capital expenditures and profit repatriation and dividends we also offer hedging and risk management services to customers which helps them manage the impact of volatile exchange rates in the course of doing business internationally

we utilize both proprietary and thirdparty payment acceptance networks to deliver our expense management solutions in our proprietary networks which tend to be geographically distinct transactions are processed on systems owned and operated by us and only at select participating merchants with whom we have contracted directly for acceptance these proprietary networks generally provide us with better economics as we control more of the transaction and richer data because of how the networks and point of sale software are configured thirdparty networks are operated by independent parties and tend to be more broadly accepted which is the primary benefit compared with our proprietary networks mastercard and visa are our primary thirdparty network partners in north america and europe respectively 

fuel 

we offer fuel solutions to businesses and government entities who operate vehicle fleets at its most basic we provide the measurement of fuel used and facilitate the payment for that fuel to the merchant whether that fuel be diesel gasoline compressed natural gas or even electricity 

the measurement and payment needs of our customers operating electric vehicles ev are similar to those operating traditional internal combustion vehicles just centered around electricity usage instead of gas or diesel usage as we help our customers manage through the transition to evs we expect many of them to operate mixed fleets and will need access to networks of fuel stations electric charging stations both on the road and at the office in addition to athome charging options considering the increased complexity of managing a mixed fleet or an all ev fleet we believe the value of our solutions will endure regardless of the propulsion method

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to our business and operations 

the extent to which the outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict 

the novel strain of the coronavirus covid19 has globally spread throughout other areas such as asia europe the middle east and north america and have negatively impacted the macroeconomic environment significantly increasing economic uncertainty the outbreak has resulted in regulatory and other authorities periodically implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and business shutdowns these measures have negatively impacted consumer and business spending and could continue to do so in addition these measures have adversely impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers suppliers and business partners these measures may remain in place or return as applicable for significant periods of time and they are likely to continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the spread of the coronavirus has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners while vaccines are currently being administered around the world vaccine availability distribution efficacy to new strains of the virus and the publics willingness to get vaccinated could limit their impact and extend the duration of the pandemic we continue to manage the business as appropriate in order to preserve our financial flexibility during this challenging time there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities 

in addition the impact of covid19 on macroeconomic conditions may impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices including fuel prices and interest rates even after the covid19 global pandemic has subsided or we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future the continued disruption of global financial markets as a result of the covid19 global pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future 

the extent to which the covid19 outbreak impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact through vaccines or otherwise and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the coronavirus outbreak has subsided we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future 

there are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of the coronavirus and a global pandemic and as a result the ultimate impact of the covid19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economy as a whole however the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations 

adverse effects on payment card transaction volume including from unfavorable macroeconomic conditions weather conditions natural catastrophes or public health crises or from changes to business purchasing practices could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers accordingly our operating results could be adversely impacted by events or trends that negatively impact the demand for fuel businessrelated products and services or payment card services in general 

for example our transaction volume is generally correlated with general economic conditions and levels of spending particularly in the us europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the related amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other business related products and services by our customers similarly prolonged adverse weather events travel bans due to medical quarantine such as the recent responses to the covid19 pandemic or in response to natural catastrophes especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions could adversely affect our transaction volumes likewise recent political investor and industry focus on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may adversely affect the volume of transactions or business operations of the oil companies merchants and truck stop owners with whom we maintain strategic relationships which could adversely impact our business 

table of contents 

in addition our transaction volumes could be adversely affected if businesses do not continue to use or fail to increase their use of credit debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions similarly our transaction volumes could be impacted by adverse developments in the payments industry such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business or a wellpublicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not creditworthy or are fraudulently completed changes in our industry customer demand and in relation to our fuel customers movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result could lead to increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment including economic weakness caused by largescale crises like the covid19 pandemic we may experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers additionally the counterparties to the derivative financial instruments that we use in our international payments provider business to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in foreign exchange rates may fail to honor their obligations which could expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate this risk includes the exposure generated when we write derivative contracts to our customers as part of our crosscurrency payments business and we typically hedge the net exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties if an international payments customer becomes insolvent files for bankruptcy commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with such counterparties for the derivatives or may bear financial risk for those receivables where we have offered trade credit if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 our bad debt expense was 1585 million and 743 million or 15 bps and 6 bps of total billings respectively 

any decrease in our receipt of fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card solutions include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments revenues for late fees and finance charges represent 4 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity or the extent to which they use optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our solutions is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer our primary competitors in the north american fuel solution are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers corporate payments solutions faces a variety of competitors some of which have greater financial resources name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services competitors in the lodging solution include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of fleet cards and vouchers for food fuel tolls and transportation and major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers who offer commercial fleet cards 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service payment terms account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources than we do in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers such as treasury management commercial lending and credit card processing which allow them to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships sometimes at a discount if price competition continues to intensify we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers decrease the prices of our solutions or lose customers each of which could adversely affect our operating results in fuel solutions major oil 

table of contents 

companies petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuel card services as a complement to their existing or complementary card products and services to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business if their fuel card products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into lower cost sales packages with other widely utilized nonfuel card related products and services 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

a decline in retail fuel prices or contraction in fuel price spreads could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

we believe in 2020 approximately 11 of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel approximately 8 of our consolidated revenue in 2020 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuel price spreads when our fleet customers purchase fuel certain arrangements in our fuel solution generates revenue as a percentage of the fuel transaction purchase amount and other arrangements generate revenue based on fuel price spreads the fuel price that we charge to any fuel customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices the significant volatility in fuel prices can impact these revenues by lowering total fuel transaction purchase amounts and tightening fuel price spreads we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fuel customers or the fuel price we charge to our fuel customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel the volatility is due to many factors outside our control including new oil production or production slowdowns supply and demand for oil and gas and market expectations of future supply and demand political conditions actions by opec and other major oil producing countries speculative trading government regulation weather and general economic conditions when such volatility leads to a decline in retail fuel prices or a contraction of fuel price spreads our revenue and operating results could be adversely affected 

the value of certain of our solutions depend in part on relationships with oil companies fuel and lodging merchants truck stop operators airlines and sales channels to grow our business the failure to maintain and grow existing relationships or establish new relationships could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 

the success and growth of our solutions depend on the wide acceptability of such cards when our customers need to use them as a result the success of these solutions is in part dependent on our ability to maintain relationships with major oil companies petroleum marketers closedloop fuel and lodging merchants truck stop operators airlines and sales channels each of whom we refer to as our “partners” and to enter into additional relationships or expand existing arrangements to increase the acceptability of our payment cards these relationships vary in length from one to eight years for oil companies to one to two years for merchants and may be renegotiated at the end of their respective terms due to the highly competitive and at times exclusive nature of these relationships we often must participate in a competitive bidding process to establish or continue the relationships such bidding processes may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing which may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships 

if the various partners with whom we maintain relationships experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise are forced to contract their operations our solutions could be adversely impacted similarly because some of our solutions are marketed under the brands of major oil companies certain other adverse events outside our control like those companies’ failure to maintain their brands or a decrease in the size of their branded networks may adversely affect our ability to grow our revenue 

the loss of failure to continue or failure to establish new relationships or the weakness or decrease in size of companies with whom we maintain relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and adversely affect our solutions and operating results 

we must comply with various rules and requirements including the payment of fees of mastercard and our sponsor banks in order to remain registered to participate in the mastercard networks 

a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the us and canada registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive even if we pursue sponsorship by alternative member banks similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist  in addition mastercard routinely updates and modifies its membership requirements changes in such requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services if we do not comply with mastercard requirements it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registration which allows us to process transactions on its networks the termination of our registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the us and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future 

our crossborder solution depends on our relationships with banks and other financial institutions around the world which may from impose fees restrictions and compliance burdens on us that make our operations more difficult or expensive 

in our crossborder solution we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions primarily crossborder crosscurrency transactions for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations increased regulation and compliance requirements are impacting these businesses by making it more costly for us to provide our solutions or by making it more cumbersome for businesses to do business with us any factors that increase the cost of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical such as trade policy or higher tariffs could negatively impact our revenues and harm our business we may also have difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships needed to conduct our services due to banks’ policies 

increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors customers and our employees with respect to our environmental social and governance esg practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks 

there is increased focus including from governmental organizations investors employees and clients on esg issues such as environmental stewardship climate change diversity and inclusion racial justice and workplace conduct negative public perception adverse publicity or negative comments in social media could damage our reputation if we do not or are not perceived to adequately address these issues any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us in addition organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries 

legislation and regulation of greenhouse gases “ghg” and related divestment and other efforts could adversely affect our business 

we are aware of the increasing focus of local state regional national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues legislation to regulate ghg emissions has periodically been introduced in the us congress and there has been a wideranging policy debate both in the us and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation several states and geographic regions in the us have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of ghgs additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions the epa andor any international agreements to which the us may become a party that control or limit ghg emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our partners’ and merchants’ operations and therefore ours see “our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results” and “if we are unable to maintain and expand our merchant relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected” because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil industry existing or future laws or regulations related to ghgs and climate change including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for fuel 

in addition to the regulatory efforts described above there have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves if these efforts are successful our ability to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively impacted 

members of the investment community have recently increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry including practices related to ghgs and climate change an increasing percentage of the investment community considers sustainability factors in making investment decisions and an increasing number of our partners and merchants consider sustainability factors in awarding work if we are unable to successfully address sustainability enhancement we may lose partners or merchants our stock price may be negatively impacted our reputation may be negatively affected and it may be more difficult for us to effectively compete 

maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our business relationships and operating results 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our solutions from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of 

table of contents 

our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets even if these activities increase our revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 39 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound brazilian real canadian dollar russian ruble mexican peso czech koruna euro australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income in addition a majority of the revenue from our international payments provider business is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments this solution also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

our expansion through acquisitions may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating or integration difficulties or increased costs and dilution to our stockholders and we may never realize the anticipated benefits 

we have been an active acquirer in the us and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall portfolio of solutions customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties delays and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business all of which may divert resources and management attention otherwise available to grow our existing portfolio in addition acquisitions may expose us to geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience present difficulties in retaining the customers of the acquired business and present difficulties and expenses associated with new regulatory requirements competition controls or investigations 

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including difficulty managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities difficulty integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds languages and organizational cultures difficulty and expense introducing our corporate policies or controls and increased expense to comply with foreign regulatory requirements applicable to acquisitions 

integration of acquisitions could also result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing operations or inconsistencies on our services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results 

to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

our business in foreign countries may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the us 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in more than 100 countries throughout north america south america europe africa oceania and asia we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various additional countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate such as russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the us in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet revenues from nonus operations or in the 

table of contents 

interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our portfolio operating results and financial condition specifically the recent exit of the uk from the european union often referred to as brexit may create significant administrative burdens and additional compliance costs for our european operations by interrupting or effectively terminating ukbased licenses that we hold to conduct financial transactions within the european union the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the uk’s withdrawal and its consequences could also adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products including our products in the uk and the european union 

in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other political economic technological operational and regulatory risks and difficulties that we do not generally face in the us these risks and difficulties could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers we do not maintain insurance to protect us against such losses we bear similar risk relating to fraudulent acts of employees or contractors for which we maintain insurance however the conditions or limits of coverage may be insufficient to protect us against such losses 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft a single significant incident of fraud or increases in the overall level of fraud involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions including significant monetary fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fuel payroll card and gift solutions results are subject to seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income 

our fuel and payroll card solutions are typically subject to seasonal fluctuations in revenues and profit which are impacted during the first and fourth quarter each year by the weather holidays in the us christmas being celebrated in russia in january and lower business levels in brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration our gift solution is typically subject to seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns historically gift revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season 

risks related to information technology and security 

we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems telecommunications data centers and call centers including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to provide reliable service to customers cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data centers and call centers as well as thirdparty labor and services providers our business involves processing large numbers of transactions the movement of large sums of money and the management of large amounts of data we rely on the ability of our employees contractors suppliers systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure uninterrupted and errorfree manner 

our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors such as power availability telecommunications carrier redundancy embargoes and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries 

we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data however there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown security breach or catastrophic event such as fire explosion flood pandemic natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure or physical breakin we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of proprietary and thirdparty processing systems a system outage could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations including by damaging our reputation or exposing us to thirdparty liability to successfully operate our business we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption including from events that may be beyond our control events that could cause system interruptions include fire natural disaster unauthorized entry power loss telecommunications failure computer viruses terrorist acts and war although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures 

table of contents 

our solutions are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that are constantly evolving we often encounter delays and cost overruns in developing changes implemented to our systems in addition the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation or exposure to liability claims in addition we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation of liability provisions in our licenses and other agreements with our customers we cannot assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

we may not be able to adequately protect our systems or the data we collect from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information social security numbers expense data and credit card debit card and checking account numbers we endeavor to keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

other than a previously disclosed unauthorized access incident during the second quarter of 2018 we are not aware of any material breach of our or our associated third parties’ computer systems although we and others in our industry are regularly the subject of attempts by bad actors to gain unauthorized access to these computer systems and data or to obtain change or destroy confidential data including personal consumer information of individuals through a variety of means 

because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our systems and the data we collect change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure computer viruses can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider 

we could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws for example we are subject to a variety of us and international statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries while we believe we are in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations if we were ever found to be in violation our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to security and privacy that we impose on our service providers who have access to customer and consumer data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data in addition we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of customer data the costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures as well as the cost of deploying additional personnel training our employees and hiring outside experts may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability protracted and costly litigation governmental and card network intervention and fines remediation costs and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers lost revenue and reputational harm while we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and such insurance may not be available for renewal on acceptable terms or at all and in any event insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident 

in addition under payment network rules regulatory requirements and related obligations we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties such as thirdparty service providers vendors partners and others which we refer to collectively as associated participants the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions and could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our solutions are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of regulators and our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing selling or encouraging adoption of new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position similarly if new technologies are developed that displace our traditional payment card as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses we may be unsuccessful in adequately responding to customer practices and our transaction volume may decline in addition we regularly engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products services and underlying technology which may or may not be successful in achieving broad acceptance or their intended purposes 

the solutions we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions all at high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we may rely on third parties to develop or codevelop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms or at all and these relationships may not be successful in addition partners some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties 

risks related to our intellectual property 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the us in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the 

table of contents 

merits of these claims because under certain conditions we may agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

finally we use open source software in connection with our technology and services companies that incorporate open source software into their products from time to time face claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software open source software is also provided without warranty and may therefore include bugs security vulnerabilities or other defects for which we have no recourse or recovery some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software andor make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost while we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related technology or service such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

risks related to regulatory matters and litigation 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the us and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to government regulations covering a number of different areas including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements licensing and registration requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security privacy and data breach requirements identity theft protection programs and aml compliance programs while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures and regulators continue to consider whether to include business customers especially smaller business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the bsa by the financial crimes enforcement network fincen and must comply with applicable aml requirements including implementation of an effective aml program our business in canada is also subject to the pcmltfa which is a corollary to the bsa changes in this regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business 

as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs in addition our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state banking authorities and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us or alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

many of these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly with increasing frequency federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training monitoring and compliance including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and appropriate manner we may be subject to injunctions other sanctions or the payment of fines and penalties and our reputation may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

for more information about laws regulations and enforcement activities that may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate see “business regulatory” 

derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities as well as impact how we conduct our business within our international payments provider operations 

rules adopted under the doddfrank act by the cftc provisions of the european market infrastructure regulation and its technical standards as well as derivative reporting in canada and the us have subjected certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer to our customers as part of our crossborder solutions to reporting record keeping and other 

table of contents 

requirements additionally certain foreign exchange derivatives transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing requirements or may be subject to margin requirements in the us uk and european union or other jurisdictions 

our compliance with these requirements has resulted and may continue to result in additional costs to our business and may impact our international payments provider business operations furthermore our failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines and other sanctions as well as necessitate a temporary or permanent cessation to some or all of our derivative related activities any such fines sanctions or limitations on our business could adversely affect our operations and financial results additionally the regulatory regimes for derivatives in the us uk and european union such as under the doddfrank act and the markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii are continuing to evolve and changes to such regimes our designation under such regimes or the implementation of new rules under such regimes such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs to our business other jurisdictions outside the us uk and the european union are considering have implemented or are implementing regulations similar to those described above and these may result in greater costs to us as well 

governmental regulations and contractual obligations designed to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services 

governmental bodies in the us and abroad have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations restricting the transfer of and requiring safeguarding of nonpublic personal information for example in the us all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to help protect the privacy and security of consumer financial information in connection with providing services to our clients we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks our sponsor banks and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer information these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer personal information received from our customers our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level or internationally our compliance costs may increase our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor material adverse effects on our business 

we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of our operations including employmentrelated disputes contract disputes intellectual property disputes government inquiries investigations audits and regulatory proceedings customer disputes and tort claims responding to proceedings may be difficult and expensive and we may not prevail in some proceedings the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief which if granted would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings regardless of whether we prevail or not such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations further these types of matters could divert our management’s attention and other resources away from our business 

in addition from time to time we have had and expect to continue to receive inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business any potential claims or any such inquiries or potential claims have resulted in and may continue to result in various audits reviews and investigations which can be time consuming and expensive these types of inquiries audits reviews and investigations could result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties various forms of injunctive relief and redress changes in personnel and increased review and scrutiny by customers regulatory authorities the media and others which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

failure to comply with the fcpa aml regulations economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws and regulations applicable to our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

table of contents 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the fcpa the uk bribery act canada’s pcmltfa and australia’s amlctf act these laws and regulations generally prohibit and our employees consultants and agents from bribing being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate these laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible 

in addition we are subject to aml laws and regulations including the bsa among other things the bsa requires money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased aml programs verify the identity of our customers report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations other group entities may be subject to additional foreign or local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions 

similar aml and counterterrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations 

violations of these laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting likewise any investigation of any potential violations of these laws and regulations by us or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and operating results in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws and regulations might be administered or interpreted 

risks related to our debt 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2020 we had approximately 43 billion of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

• we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations under our debt facilities and if we fail to satisfy these obligations an event of default could result 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for acquisitions working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate activities see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscontractual obligations” 

• covenants relating to our debt may limit our ability to enter into certain contracts pay dividends or to obtain additional financing for acquisitions working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate activities including to react to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate 

• events outside our control including volatility in the credit markets or a significant rise in fuel prices may make it difficult to renew our securitization facility on terms acceptable to us and limit our ability to timely fund our working capital needs 

• we may be more vulnerable than our less leveraged competitors to the impact of economic downturns and adverse developments in the industry in which we operate and 

• we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including through our securitization facility although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect our results of operations 

libor and certain other “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other 

table of contents 

consequences which cannot be predicted specifically there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of libor beyond 2021 in response to which the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing the secured overnight financing rate sofr and two other alternative rates beginning in april 2018 

we are not able to predict whether libor will actually cease to be available after 2021 or whether sofr will become the market benchmark in its place any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of libor relative to its historic values if the methods of calculating libor change from current methods for any reason or if libor ceases to perform as it has historically our interest expense associated with the unhedged portion of our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase further if libor ceases to exist we may be forced to substitute an alternative reference rate such as sofr or a different benchmark interest rate or base rate borrowings in lieu of libor under our current and future indebtedness and cash flow hedges any such alternative reference rate may be calculated differently than libor and may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness 

finally the replacement or disappearance of libor may adversely affect the value of and return on our liborbased obligations and the availability pricing and terms of cash flow hedges we use to hedge our variable interest rate risk alternative reference rates or modifications to libor may not align for our assets liabilities and hedging instruments which could reduce the effectiveness of certain of our interest rate hedges and could cause increased volatility in our earnings we may also incur expenses to amend and adjust our indebtedness and swaps to eliminate any differences between any alternative reference rates used by our cash flow hedges and our outstanding indebtedness 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 61 of our total assets at december 31 2020 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions which may increase in the future in connection with new acquisitions under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings which could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition

executive overview 

fleetcor is a leading global provider of digital payment solutions that enables businesses to control purchases and make payments more effectively and efficiently since its incorporation in 2000 fleetcor has continued to deliver on its mission to provide businesses with “a better way to pay” fleetcor has been a member of the sp 500 since 2018 and trades on the new york stock exchange under the ticker flt 

businesses spend an estimated 170 trillion each year in many instances they lack the proper tools to monitor what is being purchased and employ manual paperbased disparate processes and methods to both approve and make payments for their purchases this often results in wasted time and money due to unnecessary or unauthorized spending fraud receipt collection data input and consolidation report generation reimbursement processing account reconciliations employee disciplinary actions and more 

fleetcor’s vision is that every payment is digital every purchase is controlled and every related decision is informed digital payments are faster and more secure than paperbased methods such as checks and provide timely and detailed data which can be utilized to effectively reduce unauthorized purchases and fraud automate data entry and reporting and eliminate reimbursement processes combining this payment data with analytical tools delivers powerful insights which managers can use to better run their businesses our wide range of modern digitized solutions generally provides control reporting and automation benefits superior to many of the payment methods businesses often used such as cash paper checks general purpose credit cards as well as employee pay and reclaim processes

impact of covid19 on our business 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide the pandemic and these containment and mitigation measures have created adverse impacts on the us and global economies and it is unclear how long the pandemic and related economic impacts will continue the covid19 pandemic has impacted our business operations in 2020 as described in more detail under “results of operations” below due to a significant decrease in the level of business activity across industries worldwide which reduced the volume of payment services provided to our customers and revenue generated beginning during the second half of march 2020 and continuing through the date of this report 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity the operations of our suppliers vendors and customers and on our employees as a result of quarantines facility closures travel and logistics restrictions and general decreases in the level of consumer confidence and business activity our business operations and results of operations including our revenues earnings and cash flows have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by certain factors arising from the pandemic including but not limited to 

• changes in business and consumer confidence and spending habits including negative trends in our customers’ purchasing patterns due to decreased levels of business activity credit availability high debt levels and financial distress 

• volatile fuel prices and fuel price spreads 

• lower volumes of commercial trucking 

• fluctuations in the dollar compared to other currencies around the world 

• reduction in the level of business travel 

• decreased productivity due to travel bans workfromhome policies or shelterinplace orders 

• slowdown in the us and global economies and an uncertain global economic outlook or a potential credit crisis and 

table of contents 

• customers experiencing financial distress or declaring bankruptcy including seeking extended payment terms which could create incremental credit loss expense 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact the world economy and our customers in particular by restricting daytoday operations and business activity generally which adversely impacted our financial performance in 2020 the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business operations financial results and liquidity into 2021 will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess including the duration and scope of the pandemic vaccine availability distribution efficacy to new strains of the virus and the publics willingness to get vaccinated our response to the continued impact of the pandemic the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and general economic activity including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and business spending levels its short and longerterm impact on the levels of consumer confidence the ability of our suppliers vendors and customers to successfully address the continued impacts of the pandemic actions governments businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic and how quickly economies recover after the pandemic subsides 

we have taken steps to mitigate the potential risks related to the circumstances and impacts of covid19 we have been focused on addressing these challenges with proactive actions designed to protect our employees provide uninterrupted service to our customers and meet our near term liquidity needs such actions include but are not limited to 

• safety  ensuring the safety of our approximately 8400 employees worldwide with the vast majority of our employees working from home 

• business continuity  ensuring that our systems and payment solutions continue to operate efficiently for our customers 

• liquidity  actively monitoring availability under our existing credit facilities 

• expenses  slowing discretionary sales and technology spending and furloughing contractors and 

• credit  in select distressed verticals tightening customer credit lines and payment terms including closing inactive lines reducing unused capacity and reducing payment terms 

while we believe the covid19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings in 2021 we expect continued improvement throughout the year as economic activity recovers

factors and trends impacting our business 

we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance   

• global economic conditions —our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally in north america brazil and internationally including the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic factors affected by the economy include our transaction volumes the credit risk of our customers and changes in tax laws across the globe these factors affected our businesses in each of our segments 

• foreign currency changes —our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates namely by movements of the australian dollar brazilian real british pound canadian dollar czech koruna euro mexican peso new zealand dollar and russian ruble relative to the us dollar approximately 61 and 60 of our revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively was derived in us dollars and was not affected by foreign currency exchange rates see “results of operations” for information related to foreign currency impact on our total revenue net 

our crossborder foreign currency trading business aggregates foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts and economically hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties these contracts are subject to counterparty credit risk 

• fuel prices —our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a change in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease or increase in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts we believe approximately 11 and 13 of revenues net were directly impacted by changes in fuel price in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

• fuel price spread volatility —a portion of our revenue involves transactions where we derive revenue from fuel price spreads which is the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant for the same transaction in these transactions the price paid to the merchant is based on the wholesale cost of fuel the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel the inverse of these situations produces fuel price spread expansion we believe approximately 8 and 5 of revenues net were directly impacted by fuel price spreads in 2020 and 2019 respectively

• interest rates —our results of operations are affected by interest rates we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt on january 22 2019 we entered into three swap contracts the objective of these swap contracts is to reduce the variability of cash flows in the previously unhedged interest payments associated with 20 billion of variable rate debt the sole source of which is due to changes in the libor benchmark interest rate for each of these swap contracts we pay a fixed monthly rate and receive one month libor 

• expenses — over the long term we expect that our general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue increases to support our expected revenue growth we plan to continue to incur additional sales and marketing expense by investing in our direct marketing thirdparty agents internet marketing telemarketing and field sales force 

• taxes — we pay taxes in various taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in certain nonus taxing jurisdictions are different than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates

although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment in total we believe it had a negative impact on our consolidated revenue for 2020 over 2019 of approximately 95 million foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues of approximately 112 million due to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates primarily in brazil mexico and russia and lower fuel prices had an unfavorable impact of 31 million these decreases were partially offset by the impact of favorable fuel price spreads of approximately 48 million

selling selling expenses were 1927 million in 2020 a decrease of 121 million or 59 from 2048 million in 2019 decreases in selling expenses were primarily due to lower commissions and other variable costs due to reduced sales volumes and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of approximately 8 million these decreases were partially offset by expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2019 and 2020 of approximately 4 million

interest expense net interest expense was 1298 million in 2020 a decrease of 202 million or 135 from 1500 million in 2019 the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to decreases in libor and lower borrowings on our securitization facility partially offset by the impact of additional borrowings to repurchase our common stock the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility excluding the related unused credit facility fees and swaps was as follows in 2020 and 2019   



there were no borrowings on the revolving d facility in 2020 the average unused facility fee for the credit facility excluding the revolving d facility was 029 and 029 in 2020 and 2019 respectively the fixed unused facility fee for the revolving d facility was 0375 in 2020 on august 20 2020 we terminated the revolving d facility 

on january 22 2019 we entered into three interest rate swap contracts the objective of these interest rate swap contracts is to reduce the variability of cash flows in the previously unhedged interest payments associated with 2 billion of variable rate debt tied to the one month libor benchmark interest rate during 2020 as a result of these swaps we incurred additional interest expense of approximately 39 million or 194 over the average libor rates on 2 billion of borrowings 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes and effective tax rate were 1783 million and 202 in 2020 a decrease of 44 million from 1827 million and 170 respectively in 2019 included in the 2019 provision for income taxes was the reversal of a valuation allowance and remeasurement of the related deferred tax asset due to the capital loss realized upon the sale of our masternaut investment that was carried back to when the us federal tax rate was 35 and also an impairment charge to this investment prior to disposal excluding these discrete items our income taxes and effective rate for 2019 would have been approximately 248 million and 230 respectively excluding these discrete items 2020 reflects lower tax expense of 70 million and a lower effective rate compared to 2019 attributable primarily to lower book income and higher excess tax benefits related to share based compensation 

we pay taxes in different taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in certain nonus taxing jurisdictions are different than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates 

net income for the reasons discussed above our net income was 7042 million in 2020 a decrease of 1909 million or 213 from 8951 million in 2019 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income operating income was 9723 million in 2020 a decrease of 2592 million or 210 from 12314 million in 2019 consolidated operating margin was 407 in 2020 and 465 in 2019 the decrease in operating income and margin were primarily driven by the writeoff of a significant customer receivable in our crossborder payments business of approximately 90 million decreases in volume as a result of the covid19 pandemic lower fuel prices of approximately 31 million and the negative impact of acquisitions completed in 2019 and 2020 operating income was also negatively impacted by the unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates of approximately 50 million the decreases in operating income and operating margin were partially offset by the favorable impact of fuel price spreads of approximately 48 million 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north america segment operating income north america operating income was 5479 million in 2020 a decrease of 2066 million or 274 from 7545 million in 2019 north america operating margin was 346 in 2020 and 442 in 2019 the decrease in operating income and operating margin was due primarily to the writeoff of a significant customer receivable in our crossborder payments business of approximately 90 million decreases in volume as a result of the covid19 pandemic lower fuel prices of approximately 30 million and the negative impact of acquisitions completed in 2019 and 2020 these decreases in operating income and operating margin were partially offset by the favorable impact of fuel price spreads of approximately 48 million additionally the decrease in operating income was partially offset by favorable movements in foreign exchange rates of approximately 3 million 

international segment operating income international operating income was 2763 million in 2020 a decrease of 250 million or 83 from 3013 million in 2019 international operating margin was 597 in 2020 and 588 in 2019 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to decreases in volume as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness make acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios repurchase shares of our common stock and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

sources of liquidity we believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and securitization facility each defined below together with expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future based on our current assumptions at december 31 2020 we had approximately 19 billion in total liquidity consisting of approximately 941 million available under our credit facility defined below and unrestricted cash of 935 million restricted cash primarily represents customer deposits in our comdata business in the us as well as collateral received from customers for crosscurrency transactions in our crossborder payments business which are restricted from use other than to repay customer deposits as well as secure and settle crosscurrency transactions 

we also utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic receivables to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants before collecting the receivable as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions at december 31 2020 we had no additional liquidity under our securitization facility 

the company has determined that outside basis differences associated with our investment in foreign subsidiaries would not result in a material deferred tax liability and consistent with our assertion that these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested have not recorded incremental income taxes for the additional outside basis differences 

we cannot assure you that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will remain accurate due to the unprecedented nature of the disruption to our operations and the unpredictability of the covid19 global pandemic as a consequence our estimates of the duration of the pandemic and the severity of the impact on our future earnings and cash flows could change and have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition the following have impacted or may impact our liquidity 

• the negative impact of the covid19 global pandemic on our business as discussed above under “impact of covid19 on our business” 

• we have principal and interest obligations under our debt and ongoing financial covenants under those debt facilities 

• during 2020 we repurchased 35 million common shares totaling 9408 million in connection with our stock repurchase program the program on october 22 2020 our board of directors increased the aggregate size of the program by 10 billion to 41 billion at december 31 2020 we had approximately 10 billion remaining repurchase authorization under our current share repurchase program 

• we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future 

• while we intend to employ a disciplined and highly selective approach we may pursue strategic business acquisitions in the future 

• we intend to balance discretionary spending and hiring with revenue and volume trends

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 14726 million in 2020 an increase from 11621 million in 2019 the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to favorable working capital adjustments due to the timing of cash receipts and payments in 2020 over 2019 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 1062 million in 2020 a decrease from 5237 million in 2019 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for acquisitions in 2020 over 2019 and the proceeds from the sale of an investment in 2020 

financing activities net cash used in financing activities was 14168 million in 2020 an increase from 3102 million in 2019 the increased use of cash is primarily due to decreased net borrowings on our credit facility and securitization facility of 5634 million and 3559 million respectively and an increase in repurchases of our common stock of 1550 million in 2020 over 2019

critical accounting policies and estimates adoption of new accounting standards and pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition and presentation we provide payment solutions to our business merchant consumer and payment network customers our payment solutions are primarily focused on specific commercial spend categories including corporate payments fuel lodging tolls as well as gift solutions stored value cards and ecards we provide solutions that help businesses of all sizes control simplify and secure payment of various domestic and crossborder payables using specialized payment products we also provide other payment solutions for fleet maintenance employee benefits and long haul transportationrelated services 

payment services 

our primary performance obligation for the majority of our payment solutions corporate payments fuel lodging gift among others is to standready to provide authorization and processing services payment services for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions and the consideration received is contingent upon the customer’s use eg number of transactions submitted and processed of the related payment services accordingly the total transaction price is variable payment services involve a series of distinct daily services that are substantially the same with the same pattern of transfer to the customer as a result we allocate and recognize variable consideration in the period we have the contractual right to invoice the customer for the tolls payment solution our primary performance obligation is to standready each month to provide access to the toll network and process toll transactions each period of access is determined to be distinct and substantially the same as the customer benefits over the period of access 

we record revenue for our payment services net of i the cost of the underlying products and services ii assessments and other fees charged by the credit and debit payment networks along with any rebates provided by them iii customer rebates and other discounts and iv taxes assessed eg vat and vatlike taxes by a government imposed concurrent with a revenue producing transaction 

the majority of the transaction price we receive for fulfilling the payment services performance obligation are comprised of one or a combination of the following 1 interchange fees earned from the payment networks 2 discount fees earned from merchants 3 fees calculated based on a number of transactions processed 4 fees calculated based upon a percentage of the transaction value for the underlying goods or services ie fuel food toll lodging and transportation cards and vouchers and 5 monthly access fees 

we recognize revenue when the underlying transactions are complete and our performance obligations are satisfied transactions are considered complete depending upon the related payment solution but generally when we have authorized the transaction validated that the transaction has no errors and accepted and posted the data to our records 

our performance obligation for our foreign exchange payment services is providing a foreign currency payment to a customer’s designated recipient and therefore we recognize revenue on foreign exchange payment services when the underlying payment is made revenues from foreign exchange payment services are primarily comprised of the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market 

gift card products and services 

our gift solution delivers both stored value cards and ecards cards and cardbased services primarily in the form of gift cards to retailers these activities each represent performance obligations that are separate and distinct revenue for stored valued cards is recognized gross of the underlying cost of the related card recorded in processing expensed within the 

table of contents 

consolidated statements of income at the point in time when control passes to our customer which is generally upon shipment 

cardbased services consist of transaction processing and reporting of gift card transactions where we recognize revenue based on an output measure of elapsed time for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions as a result we allocate and recognize variable consideration over the estimated period of time over which the performance obligation is satisfied 

other 

we account for revenue from late fees and finance charges in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations primarily in the us and canada in accordance with asc 310 receivables such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed and services are provided we cease billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 30  40 days after the customer’s balance becomes delinquent 

we also write foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments in foreign currencies and recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative fair value and derivative accounting asc 815 derivatives 

revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment in certain of our businesses which is recognized at the time the device is sold and control has passed to the customer this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues net within the consolidated statements of income the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded in processing expenses within the consolidated statements of income 

revenues from contracts with customers within the scope of topic 606 represents approximately 75 of total consolidated revenues net for the year ended december 31 2020 

contract liabilities 

deferred revenue contract liabilities for customers subject to asc 606 were 730 million and 718 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect to recognize approximately 437 million of these amounts in revenues within 12 months and the remaining 293 million over the next five years as of december 31 2020 the amount and timing of revenue recognition is affected by several factors including contract modifications and terminations which could impact the estimate of amounts allocated to remaining performance obligations and when such revenues could be recognized revenue recognized for the year ended december 31 2020 that was included in the deferred revenue contract liability as of january 1 2020 was approximately 377 million 

costs to obtain or fulfill a contract 

with the adoption of asc 606 we began capitalizing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs the incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those that we incur to obtain a contract with a customer that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained for example a sales commission 

costs incurred to fulfill a contract are capitalized if those costs meet all of the following criteria 

a the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify 

b the costs generate or enhance resources of ours that will be used in satisfying or in continuing to satisfy performance obligations in the future 

c the costs are expected to be recovered 

in order to determine the appropriate amortization period for contract costs we considered a combination of factors including customer attrition rates estimated terms of customer relationships the useful lives of technology used by us to provide products and services to our customers whether further contract renewals are expected and if there is any incremental commission to be paid on a contract renewal contract acquisition and fulfillment costs are amortized using the straightline method over the expected period of benefit ranging from five to ten years costs to obtain a contract with an expected period of benefit of one year or less are recognized as an expense when incurred the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with sales commissions that qualify for capitalization will be recorded as selling expense in our consolidated statements of income the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with cash payments for client incentives is included as a reduction of revenues in the company’s consolidated statements of income amortization of capitalized contract costs recorded in selling expense was 153 million and 143 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are classified as contract cost assets in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets within our consolidated balance sheets we had capitalized costs to obtain a contract of 151 million and 148 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 372 million and 397 million within other assets within our consolidated balance sheets for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we have recorded 655 million and 764 million of expenses related to sales of equipment in processing expenses within the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively

practical expedients 

asc 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations however as allowed by asc 606 we elected to exclude this disclosure for any contracts with an original duration of one year or less and any variable consideration that meets specified criteria as described above our most significant performance obligations consist of variable consideration under a standready series of distinct days of service such variable consideration meets the specified criteria for the disclosure exclusion therefore the majority of the aggregate amount of transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied is variable consideration that is not required for this disclosure the aggregate fixed consideration portion of customer contracts with an initial contract duration greater than one year is not material 

we elected to exclude all sales taxes and other similar taxes from the transaction price accordingly we present all collections from customers for these taxes on a net basis rather than having to assess whether we are acting as an agent or a principal in each taxing jurisdiction 

in certain arrangements with customers we determined that certain promised services and products are immaterial in the context of the contract both quantitatively and qualitatively 

as a practical expedient we are not required to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect at contract inception that the period between when we transfer a promised service or product to a customer and when the customer pays for the service or product will be one year or less as of december 31 2020 our contracts with customers did not contain a significant financing component 

accounts receivable as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is 1 billion accounts receivable collateralized within our securitization facility relate to trade receivables resulting from charge card activity in the us pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a revolving basis to fleetcor funding llc funding a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary in turn funding transfers without recourse on a revolving basis an undivided ownership interest in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit conduit funding maintains a subordinated interest in the form of overcollateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper 

we utilize proceeds from the transfer of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of financing to reduce our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable subject to a maximum amount 

our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income reflect the activity related to securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt including interest income fees generated from late payments provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense the cash flows from borrowings and repayments associated with the securitized debt are presented as cash flows from financing activities the maturity date for the securitization facility is november 12 2021 

foreign receivables are not included in our receivable securitization program at december 31 2020 and 2019 there was 700 million and 971 million respectively of shortterm debt outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility the amounts outstanding as of december 31 2020 represent the maximum allowable amounts available to us under the terms of securitization facility 

financial instrumentscredit losses we adopted asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on january 1 2020 under which the current expected credit loss methodology for measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis replaces the previous incurred loss impairment methodology our financial assets subject to credit losses are primarily trade receivables we utilize a combination of aging and lossrate methods to develop an estimate of current expected credit losses depending on the nature and risk profile of the underlying asset pool based on product size of customer and historical losses expected credit losses are estimated based upon an assessment of risk characteristics historical payment experience and the age of outstanding receivables adjusted for forwardlooking economic conditions the allowances for remaining financial assets measured at amortized cost basis are evaluated based on underlying financial condition credit history and current and forecast economic conditions the estimation process for expected credit losses includes consideration of qualitative and quantitative risk factors associated with the age of asset balances expected timing of payment contract terms and conditions changes in specific customer risk profiles or mix of customers geographic risk economic trends and relevant environmental factors at december 31 2020 and 2019 approximately 97 and 98 respectively of outstanding accounts receivable were current accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for credit losses when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency recoveries from the thirdparty collection agency are not significant

impairment of longlived assets intangibles and investments we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable when factors indicate that these longlived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such longlived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may warrant revision 

we complete an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level we first perform a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required we then perform the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies estimates critical to our evaluation of goodwill for impairment include the discount rate projected revenue and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired 

based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively as of october 1 2020 we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of this most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment loss is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investments which are not carried at fair value for impairment we have elected to measure certain investments in equity instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for similar investments of the issuer investments classified as trading securities are carried at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss recorded within investment gain loss in the consolidated statements of income 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date we have elected to treat the global intangible low taxed income gilti inclusion as a current period expense 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribe thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense see note 13 in the accompanying financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 

business combinations business combinations completed by us have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date for significant acquisitions we obtain independent thirdparty valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist us in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the transaction 

table of contents 

estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provisional estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involve a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the final amounts recorded the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and is remeasured each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income we estimate the fair value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration using various valuation approaches as well as significant unobservable inputs reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 

stockbased compensation we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to five years and vesting of the options is generally based on the passage of time or performance stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options option forfeitures are accounted for upon occurrence we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years over which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions or a combination of these shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one to four years the fair value of restricted stock where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock units granted with market based vesting conditions is estimated using the monte carlo simulation valuation model the riskfree interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo simulation valuation model are calculated consistently with those applied in the blackscholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards 

for performancebased restricted stock units and awards and performance based stock option awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

derivatives we use derivatives to minimize our exposures related to changes in interest rates and to facilitate crosscurrency corporate payments by writing derivatives to customers 

we are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates because our borrowings are subject to variable interest rates in order to mitigate this risk we utilize derivative instruments interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company making fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount we hedge a portion of our variable rate debt utilizing derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded to the derivative assetsliabilities and offset against accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax derivative fair value changes that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item affects earnings to the extent the derivative is effective in offsetting the change in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk the portions of the change in fair value that are either considered ineffective or are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately within earnings 

in our crossborder payments business the majority of revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enables customers to make crosscurrency payments in addition we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year we aggregate our foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including forwards options and spot exchanges of currency as necessary and economically hedge the net currency risks by entering into offsetting derivatives with established financial institution counterparties the changes in fair value related to these derivatives are recorded in revenues net in the consolidated statements of income 

we recognize current crossborder payments derivatives in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other current liabilities and derivatives greater than one year in other assets and other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their fair value all cash flows associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows see footnote 17 to the consolidated financial statements derivatives

s pot trade offsetting we use spot trades to facilitate crosscurrency corporate payments in our crossborder payments business timing in the receipt of cash from the customer results in intermediary balances in the receivable from the customer and the payment to the customers counterparty in accordance with asc subtopic 21020 offsetting we apply offsetting to spot trade assets and liabilities associated with contracts that include master netting agreements as a right of setoff exists which we believe to be enforceable as such we have netted our exposure with these customers counterparties with the receivables from the customer we recognize all spot trade assets net in accounts receivable and all spot trade liabilities net in accounts payable each net at the customer level in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes the estimated dollar amounts of payments under contractual obligations identified as of december 31 2020 for the periods specified 



  

a deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31 2020 were approximately 4933 million refer to note 13 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods as a result scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading as this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs at december 31 2020 we had approximately 357 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions we cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled we do not expect reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties 

b we draw upon and pay down on the revolver within our credit agreement and our securitization facility borrowings outside of a normal schedule as excess cash is available for our variable rate debt we have assumed the december 31 2020 interest rates to calculate the estimated interest payments for all years presented this analysis also assumes that outstanding principal is held constant at the december 31 2020 balances for our credit agreement and securitization facility except for mandatory pay downs on the term loans in accordance with the loan documents we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities andor other shortterm borrowings 

c for our interest rate swap cash flow contracts the swap contracts we have used the fixed interest rate on each swap less the one month libor rate in effect on our term loans at december 31 2020 to calculate the estimated interest payments for all years presented 

d the longterm portion of contingent consideration agreements is included with other obligations in the detail of our debt instruments disclosed in note 11 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

table of contents 

pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions by product we define the pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as revenue net as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate the impact of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions the macroeconomic environment includes the impact that market fuel price spreads fuel prices and foreign exchange rates have on our business we use pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to evaluate the organic growth in our revenue and the associated transactions set forth below is a reconciliation of pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenue net and transactions in millions 



table of contents 



adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stock based compensation expense related to share based compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs discounts and intangible assets amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment and c integration and deal related costs and d other nonrecurring items including unusual credit losses occurring largely due to covid19 the impact of discrete tax items impairment charges asset writeoffs restructuring costs gains due to disposition of assets and a business loss on extinguishment of debt and legal settlements 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash share based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and share based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from our adjusted net income we also believe that integration and deal related costs and onetime nonrecurring expenses gains losses and impairment charges do not necessarily reflect how our investments and business are performing we adjust net income for the tax effect of each of these nontax items adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income net income per diluted share or cash flow from operations as determined by us generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations as determined by us gaap and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies 

organic revenue growth is calculated as revenue growth in the current period adjusted for the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment to include fuel price fuel price spreads and changes in foreign exchange rates over revenue in the comparable prior period adjusted to include or remove the impact of acquisitions andor divestitures and nonrecurring items that have occurred subsequent to that period we believe that organic revenue growth on a macroneutral onetime item and consistent acquisitiondivestiturenonrecurring item basis is useful to investors for understanding the performance of fleetcor 

management uses adjusted net income adjusted net income per diluted share and organic revenue growth 

• as measurements of operating performance because they assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis 

• for planning purposes including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget 

• to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business and 

• to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

foreign earnings 

our international businesses expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenues from our international businesses were 386 398 and 391 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2020 were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2020 by approximately 424 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2019 and 2018 were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 by approximately 477 million and 416 million respectively we have utilized international and brazil segment operating income as a proxy for foreign earnings 

unhedged crosscurrency risk 

with our crossborder payment solutions we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our crossborder payments provider business the majority of crossborder payments revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments in our crossborder payment solutions we also write foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year we aggregates foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including the derivative contracts described above and hedge economic hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates on our cash investments and on the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2020 we had 36 billion of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit agreement see note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about the credit agreement we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to changes in interest rates in january 2019 we entered into three interest rate swap cash flow contracts with us dollar notional amounts of 1 billion with a fixed rate of 256 500 million with a fixed rate of 256 and 500 million with a fixed rate of 255 maturing on january 31 2022 january 31 2023 and december 19 2023 respectively for each of these swap contracts we will receive one month libor while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highlyeffective cash flow hedges under us gaap see footnote 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about the swap contracts 

if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points and assuming we had an outstanding balance on our credit facility and term loans of 16 billion not fixed by interest rate swap contracts at december 31 2020 our interest expense would have changed by approximately 160 million based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2019 and 2018 if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense would have changed by approximately 202 million and 379 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuel price spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuel price spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuel price spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in 2013 internal controlintegrated framework as of december 31 2020 management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

in connection with managements evaluation our management team excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 the internal controls related to two subsidiaries that we acquired during the year ended december 31 2020 and for which financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements 

on august 10 2020 we acquired a business in the lodging space in the us on november 30 2020 we completed the acquisition of a fuel card provider in new zealand collectively we refer to these transactions as the acquisitions these acquisitions constituted 07 of total assets at december 31 2020 and 04 of revenues net for the year then ended this exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in managements report on internal control over financial reporting the year of acquisition 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

general 

fleetcor is a leading global business payment solutions company that simplifies the way businesses manage and pay their expenses the fleetcor portfolio of brands help companies automate secure digitize and control payments on behalf of their employees and suppliers we serve businesses partners merchants and consumer and payment networks in north america latin america europe and asia pacific fleetcor’s predecessor company was organized in the united states in 1986 and fleetcor had its initial public offering in 2010 nyse flt 

fleetcor has two reportable segments north america and international we report these two segments as they reflect how we organize and manage our employees around the world manage operating performance contemplate the differing regulatory environments in north america versus other geographies and help us isolate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our financial results

each category is unique in its focus customer base and target markets but they also share a number of characteristics customers are primarily businesses have recurring revenue models have specialized networks which create barriers to entry have high ebitda margins and have similar selling systems our payment solutions are used in more than 100 countries around the world with our primary geographies being the us brazil and the united kingdom which combined accounted for approximately 87 of our revenue in 2019 

fleetcor’s payment products generally function like a charge card prepaid card onetime use virtual card and electronic rfid radiofrequency identification etc while the actual payment mechanisms vary from category to category they are structured to afford control and reporting to the end customer 

fleetcor uses both proprietary and thirdparty networks to deliver our payment solutions fleetcor owns and operates proprietary networks with wellestablished brands throughout the world bringing incremental sales and loyalty to affiliated merchants thirdparty networks are used to broaden payment product acceptance and use 

fleetcor capitalizes on its products’ specialization with sales and marketing efforts by deploying productdedicated sales forces to target specific customer segments we market our products directly through multiple sales channels including field sales telesales and digital marketing and indirectly through our partners which include major oil companies leasing companies petroleum marketers valueadded resellers vars and referral partners

products and services 

we offer specialized payment solutions predominately for commercial businesses our payment solutions are intended to provide our customers with a payment method superior to that which they formerly used whether they used a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check our solutions are comprised of payment products networks and associated services 

our solutions tend to be specialized for specific spend categories such as fuel or lodging andor specific customer segments such as long haul transportation this specialization is manifested in the purchase controls merchant network and reporting applicable to the spend category or customer segment for example a fuel card could provide controls on the type of fuel purchased be accepted only at gas stations for fuel purchases and provide fuel usage and efficiency reports for a customer’s fleet of vehicles the combination of these specialized attributes allows our payment products to compete well against less specialized products such as cash or general purpose credit cards when it comes to controlling purchases within certain spend categories

fleetcor offers fuel payment solutions to businesses and government entities who operate vehicle fleets as well as to major oil companies leasing companies and fuel marketers our fuel payment products are most often in the form of plastic cards but also include other forms such as electronic rfid tags mobile apps and paper vouchers while predominately used to purchase fuel many of our fuel payment products have additional purchasing capabilities to allow customers to purchase nonfuel items such as oil vehicle maintenance supplies and services and building supplies 

our fuel payment products excluding paper vouchers provide customers with tools and information to control their fuel and other fleetrelated operating costs our proprietary processing and card management systems provide customers with customizable userlevel controls detailed transaction reporting programmable alerts configurable networks contracted fuel price validation and audit and vehicle efficiency analysis our customers can use these data controls and tools to combat fraud and employee misuse streamline expense administration and potentially lower their vehicle fleets’ operating costs the combination of these specialized attributes allows our fuel payment products to compete well against less specialized products such as cash or general purpose credit cards when it comes to controlling fuel purchases 

for major oil companies leasing companies and petroleum marketers we provide program management services which allow these partners to outsource the sales marketing credit service and system operations of their branded fuel card portfolios depending on our partners’ needs and internal capabilities we provide our products and services in a variety of combinations ranging from a comprehensive “endtoend” solution encompassing issuing processing and network services to limited back office processing services our fuel payment product partners include british petroleum bp its subsidiary arco shell speedway and caseys and over 700 fuel marketers of all sizes

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the cfpb which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit in addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb is authorized to issue rules prohibiting udaap by persons offering consumer financial products or services and their service providers and has authority to enforce these consumer financial protection laws and cfpb rules the cfpb has not defined what is a consumer financial product or service but has indicated informally that in some instances small businesses may be covered under consumer protection 

as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we may be subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs 

in addition the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the federal reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing clearing and settling the transaction payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee 

restrictions in july 2011 the federal reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations because we qualify for an exemption for the majority of our debit transactions 

the implementation of the doddfrank act is ongoing and as a result its overall impact remains unclear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that it is possible that we could be further directly or indirectly impacted

these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and sometimes inconsistent and subject to judicial and regulatory challenge and interpretation and therefore the extent to which these laws and rules apply to and their impact on us is in flux the extensive nature of these regulations and the implementation dates for this additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2019 approximately 13 our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 5 of our consolidated revenue in 2019 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not creditworthy or are fraudulently completed changes in our industry customer demand and in relation to our fleet customers movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result could lead to increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 our bad debt expense was 743 million and 644 million or 6 bps and 6 bps of total billings respectively 

any decrease in our receipt of program fees and charges or limitations on our program fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments revenues for late fees and finance charges represent 6 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity or the extent to which they use optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer in the fleet card business our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers in the commercial payments business we face a variety of competitors some of which have greater financial resources name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of fleet cards and vouchers for food fuel tolls and transportation and major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers who offer commercial fleet cards 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources than we do in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers such as treasury management commercial lending and credit card processing by providing these services that we do not provide these competitors have an advantage of being able to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships sometimes at a discount for example in the commercial payments business we compete with full service banks that are able to offer treasury management and commercial lending in addition to commercial payment solutions if price competition continues to intensify we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers decrease the prices of our products and services or lose customers each of which could adversely affect our operating results in the fleet card business major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as well as offer addon complementary services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies and to establish additional relationships with other petroleum marketers we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” we use this term in the business sense to refer to strategic business relationships formed through contracts such as card program agreements and not in the legal sense of operating under legal partnership arrangements created pursuant to laws such as the uniform partnership act during 2019 our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for less than 4 of our consolidated revenue our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from about one to eight years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected also our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to maintain and expand our merchant relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected 

with respect to the closed loop networks we utilize a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel maintenance services and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants and service garages typically have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew on the same basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships failure to continue such relationships on similarly attractive economic terms the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

if we are unable to maintain our relationships with major truck stop merchants our overtheroad fuel card businesses may be adversely affected 

we have long standing relationships with major truck stop merchants to accept our overtheroad fuel cards overtheroad customers purchase a significant proportion of their fuel at major truck stop merchants the loss of existing major truck stop merchant relationships or failure to continue such relationships on similar terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other business related products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the us and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the us europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other business related products and services by our customers the commercial payments industry in general and our commercial payment solutions business specifically depends heavily upon the overall level of spending unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession political climate or other changes may lead our corporate customers to reduce their spending resulting in reduced demand for or use of our products and services in addition unfavorable changes in economic conditions may lead our fleet card customers to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services as a result a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the us or abroad could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase a weakening economy could also force some retailers and merchants to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and transaction declines in addition demand for fuel and other business related products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration of current economic conditions in the us europe russia latin america australia and new zealand as a result weaknesses in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are unable to successfully integrate new lines of business we have acquired or may acquire in the future our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example we have entered into the corporate payments stored value card vehicle maintenance management and telematics business in the us and europe and transaction processing fuel food toll and transportation card and voucher businesses in brazil and mexico we may continue to enter into new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis 

the products we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions all at high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we may rely on third parties to develop or codevelop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms or at all and these relationships may not be successful in addition partners some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties even if we are successful in developing new services and technologies these new services and technologies may not achieve broad acceptance due to a variety of factors including a lack of industrywide standards competing products and services or resistance to these changes from our customers in addition we may not be able to derive revenue from these efforts 

if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2019 we had approximately 499 billion of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew every three years 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a three year term although we have been able to renew our securitization facility in the past there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us for example the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility during the financial crisis that began in 2008 also a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest we renewed our securitization facility as of august 30 2018 with an expiration date of november 14 2020 

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect our results of operations 

libor and certain other “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted in particular on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 accordingly there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of libor beyond 2021 the federal reserve board convened the alternative reference rates committee “arrc” to identify a set of alternative reference rates for possible use as market benchmarks based on the arrc’s recommendation the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” and two other alternative rates beginning in april 2018 since then certain derivative products and debt securities tied to sofr have been introduced and a number of industry groups are developing transition plans to sofr as the new market benchmark 

we are not able to predict whether libor will actually cease to be available after 2021 or whether sofr will become the market benchmark in its place any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of libor relative to its historic values if the methods of calculating libor change from current methods for any reason or if libor ceases to perform as it has historically our interest expense associated with the unhedged portion of our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase further if libor ceases to exist we may be forced to substitute an alternative reference rate such as sofr or a different benchmark interest rate or base rate borrowings in lieu of libor under our current and future indebtedness and cash flow hedges any such alternative reference rate may be calculated differently than libor and may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness 

finally the replacement or disappearance of libor may adversely affect the value of and return on our liborbased obligations and the availability pricing and terms of cash flow hedges we use to hedge our variable interest rate risk alternative reference rates or modifications to libor may not align for our assets liabilities and hedging instruments which could reduce the effectiveness of certain of our interest rate hedges and could cause increased volatility in our earnings we may also incur expenses to amend and adjust our indebtedness and swaps to eliminate any differences between any alternative reference rates used by our cash flow hedges and our outstanding indebtedness 

any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs business and results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2019 approximately 40 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound brazilian real canadian dollar russian ruble mexican peso czech koruna euro australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

our expansion through acquisitions may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders and we may never realize the anticipated benefits 

we have been an active business acquirer in the us and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 



 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 in addition the integration process following an acquisition requires significant management attention and resources integration of acquisitions could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies on our services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

our business in foreign countries may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the us 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in more than 100 countries throughout north america south america europe africa oceania and asia we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various additional countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate such as russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the us for example russia and ukraine are experiencing significant unrest which could escalate into broader armed conflict and additional economic sanctions by the us the united nations or other countries against russia in addition political discourse in the us may impact business practices in mexico and other jurisdictions in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet revenues from nonus operations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the us these include 



 following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the uk approved an exit often referred to as brexit from the european union the uk’s withdrawal became effective on january 31 2020 a transition period will apply until the end of 2020 or later if extended during which the prebrexit legal regime will continue to apply including with respect to aviation while the uk and european union negotiate rules that will apply to their future relationship it is unknown how that future relationship will be structured and it is uncertain what will be the terms of the future relationship between the uk and the european union on matters such as trade customs financial services and the movement of goods and people the united kingdom’s vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products including our products any of these effects among others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the us we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems telecommunications data centers and call centers including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to provide reliable service to customers cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data centers and call centers as well as thirdparty labor and services providers our business involves processing large numbers of transactions the movement of large sums of money and the management of large amounts of data we rely on the ability of our employees contractors suppliers systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure uninterrupted and errorfree manner 

our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors such as power availability telecommunications carrier redundancy embargoes and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries 

we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data however there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown security breach or catastrophic event such as fire explosion flood pandemic natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure or physical breakin we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of proprietary and thirdparty processing systems a system outage could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations including by damaging our reputation or exposing us 

to thirdparty liability to successfully operate our business we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption including from events that may be beyond our control events that could cause system interruptions include fire natural disaster unauthorized entry power loss telecommunications failure computer viruses terrorist acts and war although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures 

our products and services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that are constantly evolving we often encounter delays and cost overruns in developing changes implemented to our systems in addition the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation or exposure to liability claims in addition we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation of liability provisions in our licenses and other agreements with our customers we cannot assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers we do not maintain insurance to protect us against such losses we bear similar risk relating to fraudulent acts of employees or contractors for which we maintain insurance however the conditions or limits of coverage may be insufficient to protect us against such losses 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft a single significant incident of fraud or increases in the overall level of fraud involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions including significant monetary fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect our systems or the data we collect from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information social security numbers expense data and credit card debit card and checking account numbers we endeavor to keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

while we have not suffered any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches we discovered unauthorized access to certain of our systems during the second quarter of 2018 which we previously disclosed following the discovery of suspicious activity primarily on systems involving the company’s gift card business the company took prompt action to stop the activity and limit the improper use of accessed private label gift card information these gift cards do not contain personally identifiable information such as consumer names social security numbers driver’s license numbers and other sensitive personal data with the help of technology forensic firms the company also contacted federal law enforcement and merchants known to be affected the investigation has now been concluded and based on the findings of the investigation the unauthorized access was limited to what was reported in the company’s quarterly report on form 10q filed may 10 2018 and we do not expect the unauthorized access to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations other than this unauthorized access incident we are not aware of any material breach of our or our associated third parties’ computer systems although we and others in our industry are regularly the subject of attempts by bad actors to gain unauthorized access to these computer systems and data or to obtain change or destroy confidential data including personal consumer information of individuals through a variety of means including computer viruses malware and phishing 

because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our systems and the data we collect change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error 

fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure computer viruses can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws for example we are subject to statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the tcpa the canspam act fcc orders stateenacted laws regulating commercial email and foreign legislation such as the canadian antispam legislation and european laws enacted pursuant to european union directive 200258ec and its amendments while we believe we are in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations if we were ever found to be in violation our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to security and privacy that we impose on our service providers who have access to customer and consumer data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data in addition we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of customer data the costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures as well as the cost of deploying additional personnel training our employees and hiring outside experts may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability protracted and costly litigation governmental and card network intervention and fines remediation costs and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers lost revenue and reputational harm while we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and such insurance may not be available for renewal on acceptable terms or at all and in any event insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident 

in addition under payment network rules regulatory requirements and related obligations we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties such as third party service providers vendors partners and others which we refer to collectively as associated participants the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions and could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the market for our commercial payment fleet and stored value card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers if businesses do not continue to use or increase their use of credit debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe that future growth in the use of credit debit and stored value cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of services offered in order for us to consistently increase and maintain profitability businesses must continue to use and increase the use of electronic payment methods including credit debit and stored value cards moreover if there is an adverse development in the payments industry in general such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business or a wellpublicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally 

furthermore new technologies may displace credit debit andor stored value cards as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses a decline in the acceptance and use of credit debit andor stored value cards and electronic 

payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards food vouchers and cards transportation and toll road payments telematics solutions and fleet maintenance management services is also evolving and those portions of our business are subject to similar risks 

if we fail to retain any of our stored value gift card customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all which will reduce our revenue 

most of our stored value gift card customers in the us are national retailers during 2019 a majority of our gift card revenue was derived from the design and purchase of gift card inventory with the remaining portion of our 2019 gift card revenue derived primarily from processing fees if we fail to retain any of these customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all because there is a limited number of national retailers in the us and nearly all of those other national retailers already have a gift card solution in place either inhouse or with one of our competitors as such any loss of a stored value gift card customer would reduce our revenue 

legislation and regulation of greenhouse gases “ghg” and related divestment and other efforts could adversely affect our business 

we are aware of the increasing focus of local state regional national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues legislation to regulate ghg emissions has periodically been introduced in the us congress and there has been a wideranging policy debate both in the us and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation several states and geographic regions in the us have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of ghgs additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions the epa andor any international agreements to which the us may become a party that control or limit ghg emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our partners’ and merchants’ operations and therefore ours see “ our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results ” and “ if we are unable to maintain and expand our merchant relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected ” because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil industry existing or future laws or regulations related to ghgs and climate change including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for fuel 

in addition to the regulatory efforts described above there have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves if these efforts are successful our ability to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively impacted 

members of the investment community have recently increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry including practices related to ghgs and climate change an increasing percentage of the investment community considers sustainability factors in making investment decisions and an increasing number of our partners and merchants consider sustainability factors in awarding work if we are unable to successfully address sustainability enhancement we may lose partners or merchants our stock price may be negatively impacted our reputation may be negatively affected and it may be more difficult for us to effectively compete 

adverse weather conditions natural catastrophes or public health crises across a geographic region can cause a decline in the number and amount of payment transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

when travel is severely curtailed across a geographic region during adverse weather conditions or as a result of a natural catastrophe or public health crises the number and amount of transactions we process can be significantly diminished particularly in our fleet business and revenue can materially decline for example during parts of january 2014 severe winter weather shut down a large portion of the eastern us natural catastrophes such as hurricanes in east texas hurricane harvey and in florida hurricane irma each in 2017 wildfires in california in 2017 and 2018 and in colorado in 2012 and flooding in arkansas in 2019 had similar effects on a more local basis in december 2019 and january 2020 an outbreak of covid19 a new strain of coronavirus in wuhan china has resulted in travel disruption and has effected certain companies’ operations in china although at this point the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain prolonged adverse weather events or travel bans due to medical quarantine or in response to natural catastrophes especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fuel card workforce payment solutions and gift card businesses’ results are subject to seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income 

our fuel card and workforce payment solutions businesses have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and profit which are impacted during the first and fourth quarter each year by the weather holidays in the us christmas being celebrated in russia in january and lower business levels in brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration our gift card business has experienced in the past and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns historically gift card business revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season  

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 59 of our total assets at december 31 2019 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the us in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful 

could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we may agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

finally we use open source software in connection with our technology and services companies that incorporate open source software into their products from time to time face claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software open source software is also provided without warranty and may therefore include bugs security vulnerabilities or other defects some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software andor make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost while we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related technology or service such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the us and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business customers especially smaller business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

for example certain of our subsidiaries are currently licensed as money transmitters on the state level by banking departments or other state agencies continued licensing by these states is subject to periodic examinations and ongoing satisfaction of compliance requirements regarding safety and soundness including maintenance of certain levels of net worth surety bonding permissible investments in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding payment obligations with respect to certain of our products subject to licensure and record keeping and reporting if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain maintain or renew necessary licenses or comply with other relevant state regulations they will not be able to operate as a money transmitter in those states or provide certain other services and products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the financial crimes enforcement network or fincen and must comply with applicable antimoney laundering requirements including implementation of an effective antimoney laundering program changes in this regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business 

regulatory changes may also restrict or eliminate present and future business opportunities available to certain of our subsidiaries for example the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act which serves to limit interchange fees may restrict or otherwise impact the way our subsidiaries do business or limit their ability to charge certain fees to customers the cfpb is also engaged in rule making and regulation of the payments industry in particular with respect to prepaid cards the cfpb issued a final rule on prepaid accounts that came into effect on april 1 2019 the rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple unaffiliated merchants at atms or for persontoperson transfers the cfpb’s focus on the protection of consumers might also extend to many of our small business customers as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changing regulations or standards in the area of privacy and data protection could also adversely impact us in addition certain of our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authority and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

our business is subject to us federal antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bsa our business in canada is also subject to the pctfa which is a corollary to the bsa the bsa among other things requires money services businesses such as money transmitters issuers of money orders and official checks and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records the pctfa imposes similar requirements 

many of these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly with increasing frequency federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training monitoring and compliance including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and appropriate manner we may be subject to injunctions other sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties and our reputation may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

in addition recently implemented and pending changes in accounting standards for example changes relating to revenue recognition for customer contracts that became effective for fiscal 2018 may adversely affect our results of operations 

finally we have endeavored to structure our businesses in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions payroll taxes and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws their interpretations or their enforcement could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities as well as impact how we conduct our business within our international payments provider operations 

rules adopted under the doddfrank act by the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” as well as the provisions of the european market infrastructure regulation and its technical standards which are directly applicable in the member states of the european union have subjected certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer to our customers as part of the cambridge global payments “cambridge” business to reporting record keeping and other requirements additionally certain foreign exchange derivatives transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing requirements or may be subject to margin requirements in the us and european union other jurisdictions outside the us and the european union are considering have implemented or are implementing regulations similar to those described above derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements 

such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities as well as impact how we conduct our business within our international payments provider operations in particular the cftc has recently issued a proposed rule that if adopted as proposed would increase the likelihood that we will have to register one or more of our subsidiaries with the cftc as swap dealers swap dealers are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework and compliance with this framework will lead to additional costs including costs relating to regulatory capital and margin requirements and may impact how we conduct our hedging activities and derivatives business with customers we are currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule if adopted would have on our hedging activities and operations 

our compliance with these requirements has resulted and may continue to result in additional costs to our business and may impact our international payments provider business operations furthermore our failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines and other sanctions as well as necessitate a temporary or permanent cessation to some or all of our derivative related activities any such fines sanctions or limitations on our business could adversely affect our operations and financial results additionally the regulatory regimes for derivatives in the us and european union such as under the doddfrank act and the european markets in financial instruments directive known as “mifid ii” are continuing to evolve and changes to such regimes our designation under such regimes or the implementation of new rules under such regimes such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs to our business other jurisdictions outside the us and the european union are considering have implemented or are implementing regulations similar to those described above and these may result in greater costs to us as well 

governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services 

governmental bodies in the us and abroad have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations restricting the transfer of and requiring safeguarding of nonpublic personal information for example in the us all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to help protect the privacy and security of consumer financial information in connection with providing services to our clients we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks our sponsor bank and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer information these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer personal information received from our customers our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level or internationally our compliance costs may increase our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations particularly related to consumer protection and ecommerce privacy data protection and information security could harm our business 

in the us canada the european union and in other jurisdictions around the world we are subject to numerous and disparate consumer laws including laws on disputed transactions as well as regulations on ecommerce or similar legislation because we collect personally identifiable information and other data from our customers we are subject to laws and regulations in the us canada the european union and in other jurisdictions around the world restrict certain collection processing storage use disclosure and security of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time 

while we have implemented processes and procedures to comply with these laws if we or the third parties on which we rely for data fail to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes and procedures in response to existing or future regulations it could result in legal and monetary liability fines penalties or damage to our reputation in the marketplace any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally any changes to these laws their interpretation or enforcement by the government or private parties that further restrict the way we contact and communicate with our potential customers or generate leads could adversely affect our ability to attract customers and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our acquisition documents include warranties covenants and conditions regarding various tax matters that occurred prior to the acquisition supported by indemnification and in some cases holdbacks or escrows from the sellers the obligations of the sellers are also generally subject to various limitations in the event of a tax claim related to a preacquisition tax year we would seek to recover costs and losses from the sellers under the acquisition agreement however there is no assurance that any indemnification holdback or escrow would be sufficient or that we would recover such costs or losses which could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” and similar tax reform laws in other jurisdictions could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” could adversely affect our business and financial condition the tax act significantly changed how the us taxes corporations including limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and the imposition or acceleration of taxation on certain foreign income each of which may increase our tax expense both the tax act and subsequent regulations and interpretations require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation as additional clarification and guidance is issued regarding the tax act we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded which may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

various other jurisdictions including members of the organization for economic cooperation and development are considering changes to their tax laws including provisions intended to address base erosion and profit shifting by taxpayers any tax reform adopted in these or other countries may exacerbate the risks described above 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our 

compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor material adverse effects on our business 

we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our current and past operations including employmentrelated disputes contract disputes intellectual property disputes government inquiries investigations audits and regulatory proceedings customer disputes and tort claims responding to proceedings may be difficult and expensive and we may not prevail in some proceedings the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief which if granted would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings regardless of whether we prevail or not such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in june 2017 a shareholder filed a class action complaint in the unites states district court for the northern district of georgia against the company and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s stock between february 5 2016 and may 2 2017 the complaint alleges that the defendants made false or misleading statements regarding fee charges and the reasons for its earnings and growth in certain press releases and other public statements in violation of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified monetary damages costs and attorneys’ fees on october 3 2019 the parties executed a term sheet to settle the case for a payment of 50 million for the benefit of the class the full settlement amount is covered by our insurance policies on december 12 2019 the court granted the lead plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of the settlement additionally in july 2017 a shareholder derivative complaint was filed against certain of the company’s directors and officers in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia seeking recovery on behalf of the company and on january 9 2019 a second shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the superior court of gwinnett county georgia we cannot be certain that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse result on us our business our financial condition or our results of operations in addition in the future we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to this and any similar matters further these types of matters could divert our management’s attention and other resources away from our business 

from time to time we have had and expect to continue to receive inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business we have received a civil investigative demand from the federal trade commission along with proposals to resolve potential claims arising from our advertising and marketing practices which relate principally to our north american fuel card business any potential claims or any such inquiries or potential claims have resulted in and may continue to result in various audits reviews and investigations which can be time consuming and expensive these types of inquiries audits reviews and investigations could result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties various forms of injunctive relief and redress changes in personnel and increased review and scrutiny by customers regulatory authorities the media and others which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of mastercard it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations through our financial institution sponsors 

a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the us and canada registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive even if we pursue sponsorship by alternative member banks similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist  in addition mastercard routinely updates and modifies its requirements changes in the requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services if we do not comply with mastercard requirements it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registration which allows us to process transactions on its networks the termination of our registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers which would have a material adverse effect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the us and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network card transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the fcpa antimoney laundering regulations economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws and regulations associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the fcpa the uk bribery act the 2013 brazilian clean companies act and the 2013 russian law on preventing corruption these laws and regulations generally prohibit us our employees consultants and agents from bribing being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition we are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bsa among other things the bsa requires money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations other group entities may be subject to additional foreign or local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions 

similar antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations 

violations of these laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition likewise any investigation of any potential violations of these laws and regulations by us or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and operating results in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws and regulations might be administered or interpreted 

global economic downturns or slower growth or declines in the money transfer payment service and other markets in which we operate including downturns declines and difficult conditions in global financial markets and financial market disruptions could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global economy has experienced in recent years and may experience downturns volatility and disruption and we face certain risks relating to such events including 

 risks associated with foreign currencies could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our international payments provider business the majority of this business’ revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments additionally this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us 

our international payments provider business aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including the derivative contracts described above and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties if we are unable to obtain offsetting positions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we face credit liquidity and fraud risks from our agents consumers businesses and other third parties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to credit risk in our international payments provider business relating to a derivatives written by us to our customers and b the extension of trade credit when transactions are paid to recipients prior to our receiving cleared funds from the sending customers the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or 

to maintain appropriate collateral with us if a customer becomes insolvent files for bankruptcy commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with a financial institution counterparty for the derivatives or may bear financial risk for those receivables where we have offered trade credit 

if we are unable to maintain our relationships with banks needed to conduct our services or fail to comply with our contract requirements our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

in our international payments provider business we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions primarily crossborder crosscurrency transactions for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations increased regulation and compliance requirements are impacting these businesses by making it more costly for us to provide our services or by making it more cumbersome for businesses to do business with us any factors that increase the cost of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical such as trade policy or higher tariffs could negatively impact our revenues and harm our business we may also have difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships needed to conduct our services due to banks’ policies if we are unable to maintain our current business or 

banking relationships or establish new relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place our ability to continue to offer our services may be adversely impacted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions 

 in addition delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock and us these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 

we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

we currently expect to retain all future earnings if any for future operation expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our operating results financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in addition we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various pending and potential legal actions arbitration proceedings claims subpoenas and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations collectively legal proceedings based on our current knowledge management presently does not believe that the liabilities arising from these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period

dividends and share repurchases 

we currently expect to retain all future earnings if any for use in the operation and expansion of our business we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future in addition our credit agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations financial condition capital requirements and covenants in our existing financing arrangements and any future financing arrangements 

our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program as updated from time to time the program authorizing the company to repurchase its common stock from time to time until february 1 2023 on october 22 2019 our board increased the aggregate size of the program by 1 billion to 31 billion since the beginning of the program 11119657 shares have been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of 22 billion leaving us up to 857 million available under the program for future repurchases of our common stock taking into account the full 500 million committed with the 2019 asr agreement defined below which completed on february 20 2020 there were 2094115 common shares totaling 6038 million in 2019 4911438 common shares totaling 9587 million in 2018 and 2854959 common shares totaling 4024 million in 2017 repurchased under the program 

any stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as deemed appropriate the timing and amount of stock repurchases if any will depend on a variety of factors including the stock price market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements and any additional constraints related to material inside information we may possess any repurchases have been and are expected to be funded by a combination of available cash flow from the business working capital and debt

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased from 2746 million in 2018 to 2742 million in 2019  a decrease of 04 million or 01  the decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately 8 million offset by ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2019 of approximately 10 million 

other operating net other operating net decreased from 87 million in 2018 to 05 million in 2019  a decrease of 82 million  or 940 primarily as a result of a writeoff of capitalized software costs in 2018  

investment loss investment loss of 35 million in 2019 relates to an impairment charge to our telematics investment as compared to an investment loss of 71 million in 2018  in 2019 we recorded an impairment of our masternaut investment of approximately 16 million which was then was sold in 2019 at an amount approximating carrying value this loss was partially offset by an approximate 13 million gain related to a minority investment in a marketable security 

other expense income net other expense net was 01 million in 2019  compared to other income net of 1522 million in 2018  the gain in 2018 was due to the pretax gain on the sale of the chevron customer portfolio of approximately 1528 million 

interest expense net interest expense increased from 1385 million in 2018 to 1500 million in 2019  an increase of 116 million or 83  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings to repurchase our common stock and to finance acquisitions completed in 2019 as well as increases in libor the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility excluding the related unused credit facility fees and swaps 

  

the average unused credit facility fee for the revolving credit facilities was 029 and 031 in 2019 and 2018  respectively on january 22 2019 we entered into three interest rate swap contracts the objective of these interest rate swap contracts is to reduce the variability of cash flows in the previously unhedged interest payments associated with 2 billion of variable rate debt tied to the one month libor benchmark interest rate during 2019 as a result of these swaps we incurred additional interest expense of approximately 58 million or 032 over the average libor rates on 2 billion of borrowings 

loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt of 21 million in 2018 relates to the writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2018 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from 2836 million in 2018 to 1827 million in 2019  a decrease of 1009 million or 356  our effective tax rate decreased to 170 for 2019 from 259 for 2018 included in the 2019 tax rate was the reversal of a valuation allowance and remeasurement of the related deferred tax asset due to the capital loss realized upon the sale of our investment in masternaut that was carried back to 2017 when the us federal tax rate was 35 our tax rate was also impacted by the impairment charge to our investment in masternaut in the first quarter of 2019 excluding these discreet items our tax rate for 2019 would have been approximately 230 

we pay taxes in different taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in certain nonus taxing jurisdictions are different than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates 

net income for the reasons discussed above our net income increased from 8115 million in 2018 to 8951 million in 2019  an increase of 836 million or 103  

operating income and operating margin

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north america segment operating income north america operating income increased from 6739 million in 2018 to 7559 million in 2019  an increase of 820 million  or 122  north america operating margin was 429 in 2018 and 442 in 2019  the increase in operating income was due primarily to organic growth included in 2019 was the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately 4 million operating income in 2019 was also negatively affected by approximately 26 million due to the disposition of the chevron portfolio

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness make acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios repurchase shares of our common stock and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

sources of liquidity at december 31 2019  our cash balances totaled 16752 million  with approximately 4037 million restricted restricted cash represents customer deposits in the czech republic and in our comdata business in the us as well as collateral received from customers for crosscurrency transactions in our cambridge business which are restricted from use other than to repay customer deposits as well as secure and settle crosscurrency transactions 

we have immaterial outside basis differences in our investments in foreign subsidiaries and have not recorded incremental income taxes for any additional outside basis differences as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility defined below to finance a majority of our domestic receivables to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants before collecting the receivable as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility defined below as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions at december 31 2019  we had no additional liquidity under our securitization facility at december 31 2019  we had approximately 638 million available under our credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  

  

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased from 9034 million in 2018 to 11621 million in 2019  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income and movements in working capital 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased from 263 million in 2018 to 5237 million in 2019  this increase was primarily due to the increase in cash paid for acquisitions completed in 2019 partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of chevron in 2018 

financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased from 5778 million in 2018 to 3102 million in 2019  the decreased use of cash is primarily due to incremental borrowings on term a loan in the amount of 700 million  as well as fewer repurchases of our common stock of 264 million in 2019 over 2018  these reductions in cash usage were partially offset by net payments made on our revolving debt of 875 million  

capital spending summary 

our capital expenditures decreased from 814 million in 2018 to 752 million in 2019  a decrease of 6 million or 76

stock repurchase program 

our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program as updated from time to time the program authorizing the company to repurchase its common stock from time to time until february 1 2023 on october 22 2019 our board increased the aggregate size of the program by 1 billion to 31 billion since the beginning of the program 11119657 shares have been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of 22 billion leaving us up to 857 million available under the program for future repurchases of our common stock taking into account the full 500 million committed with the 2019 asr agreement defined below which completed on february 20 2020 there were 2094115 common shares totaling 6038 million in 2019 4911438 common shares totaling 9587 million in 2018 and 2854959 common shares totaling 4024 million in 2017 repurchased under the program 

any stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as deemed appropriate the timing and amount of stock repurchases if any will depend on a variety of factors including the stock price market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements and any additional constraints related to material inside information we may possess any repurchases have been and are expected to be funded by a combination of available cash flow from the business working capital and debt 

on december 14 2018 as part of the program we entered an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement 2018 asr agreement with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 220 million of our common stock pursuant to the 2018 asr agreement we delivered 220 million in cash and received 1057035 shares based on a stock price of 17691 on december 14 2018 the 2018 asr agreement was completed on january 29 2019 at which time we received 117751 additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of 18727

we accounted for the 2018 asr agreement and the 2019 asr agreement as two separate transactions i as shares of reacquired common stock for the shares delivered to the company upon effectiveness of each asr agreement and ii as a forward contract indexed to the companys common stock for the undelivered shares the initial delivery of shares was included in treasury stock at cost and results in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share the forward contracts indexed to our own common stock met the criteria for equity classification and these amounts were initially recorded in additional paidin capital 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition and presentation we provide payment solutions to our business merchant consumer and payment network customers our payment solutions are primarily focused on specific commercial spend categories including fuel lodging tolls and general corporate payments as well as gift card solutions stored value cards and ecards we provide products that help businesses of all sizes control simplify and secure payment of various domestic and crossborder payables using specialized payment products we also provide other payment solutions for fleet maintenance employee benefits and long haul transportationrelated services 

payment services 

our primary performance obligation for the majority of our payment solution products fuel lodging corporate payments among others is to standready to provide authorization and processing services payment services for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions and the consideration received is contingent upon the customer’s use eg number of transactions submitted and processed of the related payment services accordingly the total transaction price is variable payment services involve a series of distinct daily services that are substantially the same with the same pattern of transfer to the customer as a result the company allocates and recognizes variable consideration in the period it has the contractual right to invoice the customer for the tolls payment solution the companys primary performance obligation is to standready each month to provide access to the toll network and process toll transactions each period of access is determined to be distinct and substantially the same as the customer benefits over the period of access 

we record revenue for our payment services net of i the cost of the underlying products and services ii assessments and other fees charged by the credit and debit payment networks along with any rebates provided by them iii customer rebates and other discounts and iv taxes assessed eg vat and vatlike taxes by a government imposed concurrent with a revenue producing transaction 

the majority of the transaction price we receive for fulfilling the payment services performance obligation are comprised of one or a combination of the following 1 interchange fees earned from the payment networks 2 discount fees earned from merchants 3 fees calculated based on a number of transactions processed 4 fees calculated based upon a percentage of the transaction value for the underlying goods or services ie fuel food toll and transportation cards and vouchers and 5 monthly access fees 

we recognize revenue when the underlying transactions are complete and our performance obligations are satisfied transactions are considered complete depending upon the related payment solution but generally when we have authorized the transaction validated that the transaction has no errors and accepted and posted the data to our records 

our performance obligation for our foreign exchange payment services is providing a foreign currency payment to a customer’s designated recipient and therefore we recognize revenue on foreign exchange payment services when the underlying payment is made revenues from foreign exchange payment services are primarily comprised of the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market 

gift card products and services 

our gift product line delivers both stored value cards and cardbased services primarily in the form of gift cards to retailers these activities each represent performance obligations that are separate and distinct revenue for stored valued cards are recognized gross of the underlying cost of the related card recorded within processing expense within the consolidated statements of income at the point in time when control passes to our customer which is generally upon shipment 

cardbased services consist of transaction processing and reporting of gift card transactions where we recognize revenue based on an output measure of elapsed time for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions as a result we allocate and recognize variable consideration over the estimated period of time over which the performance obligation is satisfied 

other 

we account for revenue from late fees and finance charges in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations primarily in the us and canada in accordance with asc 310 receivables such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed and services are provided we cease billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 30  40 days after the customer’s balance becomes delinquent 

we also write foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments in foreign currencies and recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative fair value and derivative accounting asc 815 derivatives 

revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment in certain of our businesses which is recognized at the time the device is sold and control has passed to the customer this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues net within the consolidated statements of income the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within processing expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

revenues from contracts with customers within the scope of topic 606 represents approximately 75 of total consolidated revenues net the year ended december 31 2019  

contract liabilities 

deferred revenue contract liabilities for customers subject to asc 606 were 718 million and 306 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we expect to recognize substantially all of these amounts in revenues within approximately 12 months revenue recognized for the year ended december 31 2019  that was included in the deferred revenue contract liability as of january 1 2019 was approximately 275 million  

costs to obtain or fulfill a contract 

with the adoption of asc 606 we began capitalizing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs the incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those that we incur to obtain a contract with a customer that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained for example a sales commission 

costs incurred to fulfill a contract are capitalized if those costs meet all of the following criteria 

 in order to determine the appropriate amortization period for contract costs we considered a combination of factors including customer attrition rates estimated terms of customer relationships the useful lives of technology used by us to provide products and services to our customers whether further contract renewals are expected and if there is any incremental commission to be paid on a contract renewal contract acquisition and fulfillment costs are amortized using the straightline method over the expected period of benefit ranging from five to ten years costs to obtain a contract with an expected period of benefit of one year or less are recognized as an expense when incurred the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with sales commissions that qualify for capitalization will be recorded as selling expense in our consolidated statements of income the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with cash payments for client incentives is included as a reduction of revenues in the company’s consolidated statements of income amortization of capitalized contract costs recorded in selling expense was 143 million and 120 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are classified as contract cost assets within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets we have capitalized costs to obtain a contract of 148 million and 127 million within prepaid expenses and 397 million and 345 million within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

we have recorded 764 million  839 million and 969 million of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

practical expedients 

asc 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations however as allowed by asc 606 we elected to exclude this disclosure for any contracts with an original duration of one year or less and any variable consideration that meets specified criteria as described above our most significant performance obligations consist of variable consideration under a standready series of distinct days of service such variable consideration meets the specified criteria for the disclosure exclusion therefore the majority of the aggregate amount of transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied is variable consideration that is not required for this disclosure the aggregate fixed consideration portion of customer contracts with an initial contract duration greater than one year is not material 

we elected to exclude all sales taxes and other similar taxes from the transaction price accordingly we present all collections from customers for these taxes on a net basis rather than having to assess whether we are acting as an agent or a principal in each taxing jurisdiction 

in certain arrangements with customers we determined that certain promised services and products are immaterial in the context of the contract both quantitatively and qualitatively 

as a practical expedient we are not required to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect at contract inception that the period between when we transfer a promised service or product to a customer and when the customer pays for the service or product will be one year or less as of december 31 2019  our contracts with customers did not contain a significant financing component 

accounts receivable as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is 12 billion  accounts receivable collateralized within our securitization facility relate to trade receivables resulting from charge card activity in the us pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a revolving basis to 

fleetcor funding llc funding a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary in turn funding transfers without recourse on a revolving basis an undivided ownership interest in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit conduit funding maintains a subordinated interest in the form of overcollateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper 

we utilize proceeds from the transfer of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of financing to reduce our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable subject to a maximum amount 

our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income reflect the activity related to securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt including interest income fees generated from late payments provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense the cash flows from borrowings and repayments associated with the securitized debt are presented as cash flows from financing activities the maturity date for the securitization facility is november 14 2020 

foreign receivables are not included in our receivable securitization program at december 31 2019 and 2018  there was 971 million and 886 million  respectively of shortterm debt outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers payments from customers are generally due within 14 days or less of billing we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible from the customer once they age past 90 days we also provide an allowance for receivables aged less than 90 days that we expect will be uncollectible based on historical collections experience including accounts that have filed for bankruptcy at december 31 2019  approximately 98 of outstanding accounts receivable were current accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency recoveries from the thirdparty collection agency are not significant 

impairment of longlived assets intangibles and investments we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable when factors indicate that these longlived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such longlived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may warrant revision 

we complete an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level we first perform a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required we then perform the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies estimates critical to our evaluation of goodwill for impairment include the discount rate projected revenue and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired 

based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively as of october 1 2019  we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of this most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived 

intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investments which are not carried at fair value for impairment we have elected to measure certain investments in equity instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for similar investments of the issuer investments classified as trading securities are carried at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss being recorded in the consolidated statements of income 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date we have elected to treat the global intangible low taxed income gilti inclusion as a current period expense 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribe thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense see note 13 in the accompanying financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 

business combinations business combinations completed by us have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date for significant acquisitions we obtain independent thirdparty valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist us in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the transaction 

estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provisional estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the final amounts recorded the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and is remeasured each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income we estimate the fair value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration using various valuation approaches as well as significant unobservable inputs reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 

stockbased compensation we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to five years and vesting of the options is generally based on the passage of time or performance stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options option forfeitures are accounted for upon occurrence we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is 

recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions or a combination of these shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one to four years the fair value of restricted stock where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock units granted with market based vesting conditions is estimated using the monte carlo simulation valuation model the riskfree interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo simulation valuation model are calculated consistently with those applied in the blackscholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards 

for performancebased restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

derivatives we use derivatives to minimize our exposures related to changes in interest rates and facilitate crosscurrency corporate payments by writing derivatives to customers 

we are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates because our borrowings are subject to variable interest rates in order to mitigate this risk we utilize derivative instruments interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the company making fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount we hedge a portion of our variable rate debt utilizing derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 

changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in other assets or other noncurrent liabilities and offset against accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss net of tax derivative fair value changes that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item affects earnings to the extent the derivative is effective in offsetting the change in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk the portions of the change in fair value that are either considered ineffective or are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately within earnings 

in our crossborder payments business the majority of revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enables customers to make crosscurrency payments in addition we write foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year we aggregate our foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including forwards options and spot exchanges of currency as necessary and economically hedge the net currency risks by entering into offsetting derivatives with established financial institution counterparties the changes in fair value related to these derivatives are recorded in revenues net in the consolidated statements of income 

we recognize all cross border payments derivatives in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their fair value all cash flows associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

adoption of new accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed the company’s management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

accounting for leases in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” topic 842 which requires lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases this asu also requires disclosures to provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements effective january 1 2019 we adopted topic 842 using a modified retrospective approach as discussed further in footnote 14

those years we adopted this guidance on january 1 2019 which did not have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows the guidance did simplify the accounting for interest rate swap hedges allowing more time for the initial hedge effectiveness documentation and a qualitative hedge effectiveness assessment at each quarter end 

in october 2018 the fasb issued asu 201816 derivatives and hedging topic 815 inclusion of the secured overnight financing rate overnight index swap rate as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes which amends the hedge accounting to add overnight index swap rates based on the secured overnight financing rate as a fifth us benchmark interest rate we adopted this guidance on january 1 2019 which did not have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

comprehensive income classification in february 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 income statement  reporting comprehensive income topic 220 reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income that gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings tax effects related to items that have been stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act an entity that elects to reclassify these amounts must reclassify stranded tax effects related to the tax act’s change in us federal tax rate for all items accounted for in other comprehensive income these entities can also elect to reclassify other stranded effects that relate to the tax act but do not directly relate to the change in the federal rate we adopted this guidance on january 1 2019 and elected to not reclassify any items to retained earnings 

nonemployee sharebased payments in june 2018 the fasb issued asu 201807 compensation—stock compensation topic 718 improvements to nonemployee sharebased payment accounting that supersedes asc 50550 and expands the scope of asc 718 to include all sharebased payment arrangements related to the acquisition of goods and services from both nonemployees and employees under the new guidance the existing employee guidance will apply to nonemployee sharebased transactions as long as the transaction is not effectively a form of financing with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost the cost of nonemployee awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services in addition the contractual term will be able to be used in lieu of an expected term in the optionpricing model for nonemployee awards we adopted this guidance on january 1 2019 which had no impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

credit losses on financial instruments in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which changes how companies measure and recognize credit impairment for many financial assets the new expected credit loss model will require companies to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial assets including trade receivables that are in the scope of the update the update also made amendments to the current impairment model for heldtomaturity and availableforsale debt securities and certain guarantees the asu is effective for the company on january 1 2020 

in april 2019 the fasb issued asu 201904 codification improvements to topic 326 financial instrumentscredit losses topic 815 derivatives and hedging and topic 825 financial instruments which clarifies certain aspects of accounting for credit losses hedging activities and financial instruments for clarifications around credit losses the effective date will be the same as the effective date in asu 201613 for entities that have adopted asu 201712 derivatives and hedging topic 815 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities asu 201904 is effective the first annual reporting period beginning after the date of issuance of asu 201904 and may be early adopted the amendments in asu 201904 related to asu 201601 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods therein upon adoption of the new standard on january 1 2020 we will recognize an allowance for credit losses based on the estimated lifetime expected credit loss related to our financial assets we are analyzing our credit policies and updating our accounting policies and internal controls that will be impacted by the new guidance we do not anticipate that the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows due to the relatively fast turnover of our trade receivables accounts and limited other asset balances to which this standard applies 

cloud computing arrangements on august 29 2018 the fasb issued asu 201815 intangibles—goodwill and other— internaluse software subtopic 35040 customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract that provides guidance on implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement cca that is a service contract the asu which was released in response to a consensus reached by the eitf at its june 2018 meeting aligns the accounting for such costs with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internaluse software specifically the asu amends asc 350 to include in its scope implementation costs of a cca that is a service contract and clarifies that a customer should apply asc 35040 to determine which implementation costs should be capitalized in such a cca the guidance is effective for the company for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years the guidance should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption we are updating the accounting policies and internal controls that will be impacted by the new guidance our adoption of this asu on january 1 2020 is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

fair value measurement on august 28 2018 the fasb issued asu 201813 fair value measurement topic 820 disclosure framework—changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement which removes modifies and adds certain disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements in asc 820 the guidance is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 the guidance on changes in unrealized gains and losses the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption all other guidance should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date our adoption of this asu on january 1 2020 is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

income taxes on december 18 2019 the fasb issued asu 201912 income taxes topic 740 simplifying the accounting for income taxes “asu 201912” which removes certain exceptions to the general principles of asc 740 and simplifies other areas in order to simplify its application for public business entities the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2020 including interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted we do not expect this asu to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes the estimated dollar amounts of payments under contractual obligations identified below as of december 31 2019 for the periods specified 

  



  



would not relate to liquidity needs at december 31 2019 we had approximately 428 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions we cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled we do not expect reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties 

 management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions by product we define the pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as revenue net as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate the impact of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of acquisitions dispositions and the impact of adoption of asc 606 the macroeconomic environment includes the impact that market fuel spread margins fuel prices and foreign exchange rates have on our business we use pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to evaluate the organic growth in our revenue and the associated transactions set forth below is a reconciliation of pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to the most directly comparable gaap 

measure revenue net and transactions in millions 

 columns may not calculate due to rounding 

1 other includes telematics maintenance food and transportation related businesses 

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stock based compensation expense related to share based compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs discounts and intangible assets amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment and c other nonrecurring items such as the impact of the tax act impairment of investment asset writeoffs restructuring costs gains and related taxes due to disposition of assets and a business loss on extinguishment of debt legal settlementslitigation and the unauthorized access impact 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash share based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and share based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from our adjusted net income we also believe onetime nonrecurring gains losses and impairment charges do not necessarily reflect how our investments and business are performing we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations as determined by us gaap and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

  






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

foreign earnings 

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 355  354 and 365 of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2019 were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2019 by approximately 476 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2018 and 2017 were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 by approximately 417 million and 342 million  respectively we have utilized international segment operating income as a proxy for foreign earnings 

unhedged crosscurrency risk 

with the acquisition of cambridge in august 2017 we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our international payments provider business the majority of cambridges revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments in addition cambridge also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year cambridge aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including the derivative contracts described above and hedges economic hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates on our cash investments and on the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt as of december 31 2019 we had 402 billion of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit agreement see footnote 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for information about the credit agreement we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to changes in interest rates in january 2019 we entered into three interest rate swap cash flow contracts with us dollar notional amounts of 1 billion with a fixed rate of 256 500 million with a fixed rate of 256 and 500 million with a fixed rate of 255 maturing on january 31 2022 january 31 2023 and december 19 2023 respectively for each of these swap contracts we will receive one month libor while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highlyeffective cash flow hedges under us gaap see footnote 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information about the swap contracts 

if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points and assuming we had an outstanding balance on our credit facility and term loans of 202 billion not fixed by interest rate swap contracts at december 31 2019 our interest expense would have changed by approximately 202 million based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2018 and 2017  if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense would have changed by approximately 379 million and 347 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2019  management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2019  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework as of december 31 2019  management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

in connection with managements evaluation our management team excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 the internal controls related to four subsidiaries that we acquired during the year ended december 31 2019 and for which financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements 

on april 1 2019 we acquired nvoicepay a provider of full accounts payable automation for business in the us on april 1 2019 we acquired r2c a fleet maintenance compliance and workshop management software provider in the uk on july 8 2019 we acquired sole financial a payroll card provider in the us on october 1 2019 we acquired travelliance an airline lodging provider in the us collectively we refer to these transactions as the acquisitions these acquisitions constituted 6 of total assets at december 31 2019 and 2 of revenues net for the year then ended this exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in managements report on internal control over financial reporting the year of acquisition 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2019  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

our payment products typically function like a charge card or prepaid card fleetcor provides a variety of payment mechanisms such as a plastic card electronic tag or other form to the customer we issue credit to the customer or accept prepaid funds from the customer to allow for purchases using the payment product fleetcor then reports the purchases to the customer and invoices or debits prepaid amounts for payment of purchases made on the customer’s account 

payment networks are integral to our solutions as they allow us to electronically connect to merchants and capture transaction data from the point of sale we use both proprietary and thirdparty networks to deliver our payment solutions for our proprietary networks fleetcor provides merchant acquiring services which may include affiliation contract management pointofsale terminals reporting and settlement fleetcor owns and operates proprietary networks with wellestablished brands across 80 countries bringing incremental sales and loyalty to affiliated merchants thirdparty networks include mastercard in the us and visa in the uk and continental europe the retail outlets of various partners and proprietary networks owned and operated by other partners we use these thirdparty networks in order to broaden our payment product acceptance and use through our proprietary and thirdparty networks we capture detailed transaction data and can often enable advanced purchase controls at the pointofsale

depending on our customers’ and partners’ needs we provide our products and services in a variety of combinations ranging from a comprehensive “endtoend” solution encompassing issuing processing and network services to limited back office processing services 

our solutions tend to be specialized for specific spend categories such as fuel or lodging andor specific customer segments such as long haul transportation this specialization is manifested in the purchase controls merchant network and reporting applicable to the spend category or customer segment for example a fuel card could provide controls on the type of fuel purchased be accepted only at gas stations for fuel purchases and provide fuel usage and efficiency reports for a customer’s fleet of vehicles the combination of these specialized attributes allows our payment products to compete well against less specialized products such as cash or general purpose credit cards when it comes to controlling purchases within certain spend categories

nonbanks that provide certain financial services are required to register with the financial crimes enforcement network of the us department of the treasury fincen as “money services businesses” msbs through certain subsidiaries we are registered as msbs as a result we have established antimoney laundering compliance programs that include i internal policies and controls ii designation of a compliance officer iii ongoing employee training and iv an independent review function we have developed and implemented compliance programs comprised of policies procedures systems and internal controls to monitor and address various legal requirements and developments

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the cfpb which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit in addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb is authorized to issue rules prohibiting unfair deceptive and abusive acts and practices udaap by persons offering consumer financial products or services and their service providers and has authority to enforce these consumer financial protection laws and cfpb rules the cfpb has not defined what is a consumer financial product or service but has indicated informally that in some instances small businesses may be covered under consumer protection 

as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we may be subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs 

in addition the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the federal reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing clearing and settling the transaction payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions in july 2011 the federal reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations because we qualify for an exemption for the majority of our debit transactions 

the implementation of the doddfrank act is ongoing and as a result its overall impact remains unclear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that it is possible that we could be further directly or indirectly impacted

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see note regarding forwardlooking statements in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2018  approximately 14  our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 5  of our consolidated revenue in 2018  was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not creditworthy or are fraudulently completed changes in our industry customer demand and in relation to our fleet customers movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result could lead to increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  our bad debt expense was 644 million  and 449 million  or 6 bps and 7 bps of total billings respectively 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments revenues for late fees and finance charges represent 6  of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity or the extent to which they use optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer in the fleet card business our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers in the commercial payments business we face a variety of competitors some of which have greater financial resources name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of fleet cards and vouchers for food fuel tolls and transportation and major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers who offer commercial fleet cards 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources than we do in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers such as treasury management commercial lending and credit card processing by providing these services that we do not provide these competitors have an advantage of being able to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships sometimes at a discount for example in the commercial payments business we compete with full service banks that are able to offer treasury management and commercial lending in addition to commercial payment solutions if price competition continues to intensify we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers decrease the prices of our products and services or lose customers each of which could adversely affect our operating results in the fleet card business major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as well as offer addon complementary services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies and to establish additional relationships with other petroleum marketers we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” we use this term in the business sense to refer to strategic business relationships formed through contracts such as card program agreements and not in the legal sense of operating under legal partnership arrangements created pursuant to laws such as the uniform partnership act during 2018  our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for less than 6 of our consolidated revenue our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from about one to eight years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected also our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base in the closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel maintenance services and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected 

with respect to the closed loop networks we utilize a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants and service garages typically have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew on the same basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships failure to continue such relationships on similarly attractive economic terms the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

we depend on our relationships with major truck stop merchants to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers we must maintain these relationships to effectively serve our customers that use these merchants if we are unable to maintain these relationships our overtheroad fuel card businesses may be adversely affected 

we have long standing relationships with major truck stop merchants to accept our overtheroad fuel cards overtheroad customers purchase a significant proportion of their fuel at major truck stop merchants the loss of existing major truck stop merchant relationships or failure to continue such relationships on similar terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other business related products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the us and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the us europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other business related products and services by our customers the commercial payments industry in general and our commercial payment solutions business specifically depends heavily upon the overall level of spending unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession political climate or other changes may lead our corporate customers to reduce their spending resulting in reduced demand for or use of our products and services in addition unfavorable changes in economic conditions may lead our fleet card customers to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services as a result a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the us or abroad could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase a weakening economy could also force some retailers and merchants to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and transaction declines in addition demand for fuel and other business related products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration of current economic conditions in the us europe russia latin america australia and new zealand as a result weaknesses in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example we have entered into the corporate payments stored value card vehicle maintenance management and telematics business in the us and europe and transaction processing fuel food toll and transportation card and voucher businesses in brazil and mexico we may continue to enter into new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis 

the products we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions all at high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we may rely on third parties to develop or codevelop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms or at all and these relationships may not be successful in addition partners some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties even if we are successful in developing new services and technologies these new services and technologies may not achieve broad acceptance due to a variety of factors including a lack of industrywide standards competing products and services or resistance to these changes from our customers in addition we may not be able to derive revenue from these efforts 

if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2018  we had approximately 478 billion  of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew every three years 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a three year term although we have been able to renew our securitization facility in the past there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us for example the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility during the financial crisis that began in 2008 also a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are 

exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest we renewed our securitization facility as of august 30 2018 with an expiration date of november 14 2020  

changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect our results of operations 

libor and certain other “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted in particular on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 it is unclear whether at that time libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will be established any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of libor relative to its historic values if the methods of calculating libor change from current methods for any reason or if libor ceases to perform as it has historically our interest expense associated with the unhedged portion of our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase further if libor ceases to exist we may be forced to substitute an alternative reference rate such as a different benchmark interest rate or base rate borrowings in lieu of libor under our current and future indebtedness and cash flow hedges at this point it is not clear what if any alternative reference rate may be adopted to replace libor however any such alternative reference rate may be calculated differently than libor and may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness 

finally the replacement or disappearance of libor may adversely affect the value of and return on our liborbased obligations and the availability pricing and terms of cash flow hedges we use to hedge our variable interest rate risk alternative reference rates or modifications to libor may not align for our assets liabilities and hedging instruments which could reduce the effectiveness of certain of our interest rate hedges and could cause increased volatility in our earnings we may also incur expenses to amend and adjust our indebtedness and swaps to eliminate any differences between any alternative reference rates used by our cash flow hedges and our outstanding indebtedness 

any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs business and results of operations 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 39  of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound brazilian real canadian dollar russian ruble mexican peso czech koruna euro australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer in the us and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 



 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 in addition the integration process following an acquisition requires significant management attention and resources integration of acquisitions could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies on our services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the us 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in 82 countries throughout north america south america europe africa oceania and asia we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various additional countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate such as russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the us for example russia and ukraine are experiencing significant unrest which could escalate into broader armed conflict and additional economic sanctions by the us united nations or other countries against russia in addition political discourse in the us may impact business practices in mexico and other jurisdictions in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet revenues from nonus operations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the us these include 

 in addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union and this uncertainty may persist for years a withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products including our products any of these effects among others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the us we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems telecommunications data centers and call centers including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to provide reliable service to customers cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data centers and call centers as well as thirdparty labor and services providers our business involves processing large numbers of transactions the movement of large sums of money and the management of large amounts of data we rely on the ability of our employees contractors suppliers systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure uninterrupted and errorfree manner 

our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors such as power availability telecommunications carrier redundancy embargoes and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries 

we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data however there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown security breach or catastrophic event such as fire explosion flood pandemic natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure or physical breakin we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of proprietary and thirdparty processing systems a system outage could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations including by damaging our reputation or exposing us to thirdparty liability to successfully operate our business we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption including from events that may be beyond our control events that could cause system interruptions include fire natural disaster unauthorized entry power loss telecommunications failure computer viruses terrorist acts and war although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures 

our products and services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that are constantly evolving we often encounter delays and cost overruns in developing changes implemented to our systems in addition the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation or exposure to liability claims in addition we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation of liability provisions in our licenses and other agreements with our customers we cannot assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers we do not maintain insurance to protect us against such losses we bear similar risk relating to fraudulent acts of employees or contractors for which we maintain insurance however the conditions or limits of coverage may be insufficient to protect us against such losses 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft a single significant incident of fraud or increases in the overall level of fraud involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions including significant monetary fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect our systems or the data we collect from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information social security numbers expense data and credit card debit card and checking account numbers we endeavor to keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

while we have not suffered any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches we discovered unauthorized access to certain of our systems during the second quarter of 2018 which we previously disclosed following the discovery of suspicious activity primarily on systems involving the company’s gift card business the company took prompt 

action to stop the activity and limit the improper use of accessed private label gift card information these gift cards do not contain personally identifiable information such as consumer names social security numbers driver’s license numbers and other sensitive personal data with the help of technology forensic firms the company also contacted federal law enforcement and merchants known to be affected the investigation has now been concluded and based on the findings of the investigation the unauthorized access was limited to what was reported in the company’s quarterly report on form 10q filed may 10 2018 and we do not expect the unauthorized access to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations other than this unauthorized access incident we are not aware of any material breach of our or our associated third parties’ computer systems although we and others in our industry are regularly the subject of attempts by bad actors to gain unauthorized access to these computer systems and data or to obtain change or destroy confidential data including personal consumer information of individuals through a variety of means including computer viruses malware and phishing 

because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our systems and the data we collect change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure computer viruses can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws for example we are subject to statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the tcpa the canspam act fcc orders stateenacted laws regulating commercial email and foreign legislation such as the canadian antispam legislation and european laws enacted pursuant to european union directive 200258ec and its amendments while we believe we are in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations if we were ever found to be in violation our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to security and privacy that we impose on our service providers who have access to customer and consumer data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data in addition we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of customer data the costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures as well as the cost of deploying additional personnel training our employees and hiring outside experts may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability protracted and costly litigation governmental and card network intervention and fines remediation costs and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers lost revenue and reputational harm while we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and such insurance may not be available for renewal on acceptable terms or at all and in any event insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident 

in addition under payment network rules regulatory requirements and related obligations we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties such as third party service providers vendors partners and others which we refer to collectively as associated participants the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions and could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the market for our commercial payment fleet and stored value card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers if businesses do not continue to use or increase their use of credit debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe that future growth in the use of credit debit and stored value cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse 

and quality of services offered in order for us to consistently increase and maintain profitability businesses must continue to use and increase the use of electronic payment methods including credit debit and stored value cards moreover if there is an adverse development in the payments industry in general such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business or a wellpublicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally 

furthermore new technologies may displace credit debit andor stored value cards as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses a decline in the acceptance and use of credit debit andor stored value cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards food vouchers and cards transportation and toll road payments telematics solutions and fleet maintenance management services is also evolving and those portions of our business are subject to similar risks 

if we fail to retain any of our stored value gift card customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all which will reduce our revenue 

most of our stored value gift card customers in the us are national retailers during 2018  a majority of our gift card revenue was derived from the design and purchase of gift card inventory with the remaining portion of our 2018  gift card revenue derived primarily from processing fees if we fail to retain any of these customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all because there is a limited number of national retailers in the us and nearly all of those other national retailers already have a gift card solution in place either inhouse or with one of our competitors as such any loss of a stored value gift card customer would reduce our revenue 

adverse weather conditions across a geographic region can cause a decline in the number and amount of payment transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

when travel is severely curtailed across a geographic region during adverse weather conditions the number and amount of transactions we process can be significantly diminished particularly in our fleet business and revenue can materially decline for example during parts of january 2014 severe winter weather shut down a large portion of the eastern united states prolonged adverse weather events especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fuel card workforce payment solutions and gift card businesses’ results are subject to seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income 

our fuel card and workforce payment solutions businesses have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and profit which are impacted during the first and fourth quarter each year by the weather holidays in the us christmas being celebrated in russia in january and lower business levels in brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration our gift card business has experienced in the past and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns historically gift card business revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season  

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 62  of our total assets at december 31 2018  these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is 

determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the us in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we may agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

finally we use open source software in connection with our technology and services companies that incorporate open source software into their products from time to time face claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software open source software is also provided without warranty and may therefore include bugs security vulnerabilities or other defects some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software andor make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost while we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose 

the source code to the related technology or service such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the us and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

for example certain of our subsidiaries are currently licensed as money transmitters on the state level by the banking departments or other state agencies continued licensing by these states is subject to periodic examinations and ongoing satisfaction of compliance requirements regarding safety and soundness including maintenance of certain levels of net worth surety bonding permissible investments in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding payment obligations with respect to certain of our products subject to licensure and record keeping and reporting if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain maintain or renew necessary licenses or comply with other relevant state regulations they will not be able to operate as a money transmitter in those states or provide certain other services and products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the financial crimes enforcement network or fincen and must comply with applicable antimoney laundering requirements including implementation of an effective antimoney laundering program changes in this regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business 

regulatory changes may also restrict or eliminate present and future business opportunities available to certain of our subsidiaries for example the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act which serves to limit interchange fees may restrict or otherwise impact the way our subsidiaries do business or limit their ability to charge certain fees to customers the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb is also engaged in rule making and regulation of the payments industry in particular with respect to prepaid cards and in october 2016 the cfpb issued a final rule amending regulations e and z to create comprehensive consumer protections for prepaid financial products on january 25 2018 the cfpb issued a final rule amending several aspects of its prepaid accounts rule adopted in october 2016 and delayed the overall effective date for such prepaid accounts rule to april 1 2019 the extensive nature of these regulations and the implementation dates for this additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business the cfpb’s focus on the protection of consumers might also extend to many of our small business customers as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changing regulations or standards in the area of privacy and data protection could also adversely impact us in addition certain of our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authority and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

our business is subject to us federal antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bsa our business in canada is also subject to proceeds of crime money laundering and terrorist financing act or the pctfa which is a corollary to the 

bsa the bsa among other things requires money services businesses such as money transmitters issuers of money orders and official checks and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records the pctfa imposes similar requirements 

many of these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly with increasing frequency federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training monitoring and compliance including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and appropriate manner we may be subject to injunctions other sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties and our reputation may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

in addition recently implemented and pending changes in accounting standards for example changes relating to revenue recognition for customer contracts that became effective for fiscal 2018 may adversely affect our results of operations 

finally we have endeavored to structure our businesses in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions payroll taxes and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws their interpretations or their enforcement could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

for more information about laws regulations and enforcement activities that may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate see “business regulatory 

derivatives regulations 

rules adopted under the doddfrank act by the commodity futures trading commission the cftc as well as the provisions of the european market infrastructure regulation and its technical standards which are directly applicable in the member states of the european union have subjected certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer to our customers as part of the cambridge global payments cambridge business to reporting recordkeeping and other requirements additionally certain foreign exchange derivatives transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing requirements or may be subject to margin requirements in the united states and european union other jurisdictions outside the united states and the european union are considering have implemented or are implementing regulations similar to those described above derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities as well as impact how we conduct our business within our international payments provider operations in particular the cftc has recently issued a proposed rule that if adopted as proposed would increase the likelihood that we will have to register one or more of our subsidiaries with the cftc as swap dealers swap dealers are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework and compliance with this framework will lead to additional costs including costs relating to regulatory capital and margin requirements and may impact how we conduct our hedging activities and derivatives business with customers we are currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule if adopted would have on our hedging activities and operations 

our compliance with these requirements has resulted and may continue to result in additional costs to our business and may impact our international payments provider business operations furthermore our failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines and other sanctions as well as necessitate a temporary or permanent cessation to some or all of our derivative related activities any such fines sanctions or limitations on our business could adversely affect our operations and financial results additionally the regulatory regimes for derivatives in the united states and european union such as under the doddfrank act and the european markets in financial instruments directive known as mifid ii are continuing to evolve and changes to such regimes our designation under such regimes or the implementation of new rules under such regimes such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs 

to our business other jurisdictions outside the united states and the european union are considering have implemented or are implementing regulations similar to those described above and these may result in greater costs to us as well 

governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services 

governmental bodies in the us and abroad have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations restricting the transfer of and requiring safeguarding of nonpublic personal information for example in the us all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to help protect the privacy and security of consumer financial information in connection with providing services to our clients we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks our sponsor bank and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer information these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer personal information received from our customers our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level or internationally our compliance costs may increase our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations particularly related to privacy data protection and information security and we are subject to disparate consumer protection laws across different countries our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 

in the us the european union and in other jurisdictions around the world we are subject to numerous and disparate consumer laws including laws on disputed transactions as well as regulations on ecommerce or similar legislation if we are found to have breached any consumer ecommerce or similar legislation in any country we may be subject to enforcement actions that require us to change our business practices in a manner which may negatively impact revenue as well as litigation fines penalties and adverse publicity that could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business in a manner that harms our financial position 

we collect personally identifiable information and other data from our customers laws and regulations in several countries restrict certain collection processing storage use disclosure and security of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information several foreign countries and governmental bodies including the countries of the european union and canada have laws and regulations which are often more restrictive than those in the united states the data privacy regime in the eu includes certain directives which among other things require european union member states to regulate the processing and movement of personal data marketing and the use of cookies each european union member state has transposed the requirements of these directives into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time 

future restrictions on the collection use sharing or disclosure of personally identifiable information or additional requirements and liability for security and data integrity could require us to modify our solutions and features possibly in a material manner and could limit our ability to develop new services and features for example the euwide general data protection regulation or gdpr which was passed by the european union parliament in the spring of 2016 and became fully effective in may 2018 replaced the data protection laws of each european union member state the gdpr implements more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including for example increased requirements to erase an individual’s information upon request mandatory data breach notification requirements and new obligations on service providers it also significantly increases penalties for noncompliance including where we act as a service provider  eg  data processor if our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations we may be subject to litigation regulatory investigations enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data or our marketing practices fines for example of up to 20000000 euros or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher under the gdpr or other liabilities as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business 

in february 2013 the european commission proposed euwide legislation regarding cybersecurity in the form of the proposed network and information security directive or the nis directive the nis directive requires eu member states to impose cybersecurity obligationsincluding data breach notification requirementsto operators of “essential services” and to “digital service providers” the nis directive and its implementing legislation if held to apply to us may lead to compliance obligations that require us to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business which could increase our operating costs and failure to comply may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation fines penalties and adverse publicity 

we are also subject to various statutes regulations and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and textmessaging industries including the tcpa the canspam act and related fcc orders the tcpa as interpreted and implemented by the fcc and us courts imposes significant restrictions on the use of telephone calls and text messages to residential and mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication when prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained violations of the tcpa may be enforced by the fcc or by individuals through litigation including class actions statutory penalties for tcpa violations range from 500 to 1500 per violation which has been interpreted to mean per phone call while we have implemented processes and procedures to comply with these laws if we or the third parties on which we rely for data fail to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes and procedures in response to existing or future regulations it could result in legal and monetary liability fines penalties or damage to our reputation in the marketplace any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally any changes to these laws their interpretation or enforcement by the government or private parties that further restrict the way we contact and communicate with our potential customers or generate leads could adversely affect our ability to attract customers and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our acquisition documents include warranties covenants and conditions regarding various tax matters that occurred prior to the acquisition supported by indemnification and in some cases holdbacks or escrows from the sellers the obligations of the sellers are also generally subject to various limitations in the event of a tax claim related to a preacquisition tax year we would seek to recover costs and losses from the sellers under the acquisition agreement however there is no assurance that any indemnification holdback or escrow would be sufficient or that we would recover such costs or losses which could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results 

the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act the tax act act could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act could adversely affect our business and financial condition the tax act significantly changed how the us taxes corporations including limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and the imposition or acceleration of taxation on certain foreign income each of which may increase our tax expense both the tax act and subsequent regulations and interpretations require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation as additional clarification and guidance is issued regarding the tax act we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded which may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

various other jurisdictions including members of the organization for economic cooperation and development are considering changes to their tax laws including provisions intended to address base erosion and profit shifting by taxpayers any tax reform adopted in these or other countries may exacerbate the risks described above 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor material adverse effects on our business 

we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our current and past operations including employmentrelated disputes contract disputes intellectual property disputes government inquiries investigations audits and regulatory proceedings customer disputes and tort claims responding to proceedings may be difficult and expensive and we may not prevail in some proceedings the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief which if granted would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings regardless of whether we prevail or not such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have had and expect to continue to receive inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business such inquiries have resulted in and may continue to result in various audits reviews and investigations which can be time consuming and expensive these types of inquiries audits reviews and investigations could result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties changes in personnel and increased review and scrutiny by customers regulatory authorities the media and others which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations for more information about our judicial and other proceedings see “business—legal proceedings” 

we are named in a federal securities class action lawsuit and related derivative complaints as well as a customer class action complaint if we are unable to resolve these matters favorably then our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

in june 2017 a shareholder filed a class action complaint in the unites states district court for the northern district of georgia against the company and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s stock between february 5 2016 and may 2 2017 in july 2017 a shareholder derivative complaint was filed against certain of the company’s directors and officers in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia seeking recovery on behalf of the company and on january 9 2019 a second shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the superior court of gwinnett county georgia in addition on february 1 2019 a customer class action complaint against a subsidiary of the company was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia see “part iiitem 3  legal proceedings” below for additional information about these matters we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these matters or reasonably determine the probability of a material adverse result or reasonably estimate range of potential exposure if any that these matters might have on us our business our financial condition or our results of operations although such effects could be materially adverse in addition in the future we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to 

these matters further regardless of how these matters proceed it could divert our management’s attention and other resources away from our business 

our revenues from mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of mastercard it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations through our financial institution sponsors 

a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the us and canada registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive even if we pursue sponsorship by alternative member banks similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist   in addition mastercard routinely updates and modifies its requirements changes in the requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services if we do not comply with mastercard requirements it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registration which allows us to process transactions on its networks the termination of our registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers which would have a material adverse effect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network card transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the fcpa antimoney laundering regulations economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws and regulations associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the fcpa the uk bribery act the 2013 brazilian clean companies act and the 2013 russian law on preventing corruption these laws and regulations generally prohibit us our employees consultants and agents from bribing being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition we are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bsa among other things the bsa requires money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations other group entities may be subject to additional foreign or local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions 

similar antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations 

violations of these laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition likewise any investigation of any potential violations of these laws and regulations by us or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and operating results in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws and regulations might be administered or interpreted 

global economic downturns or slower growth or declines in the money transfer payment service and other markets in which we operate including downturns declines and difficult conditions in global financial markets and   financial market disruptions could adversely affect our business financial   condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global economy has experienced in recent years and may experience downturns volatility and disruption and we face certain risks relating to such events including 

 risks associated with operations outside the us and foreign currencies could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our international payments provider business the majority of this business revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments additionally this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us 

our international payments provider business aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including the derivative contracts described above and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting 

contracts with established financial institution counterparties if we are unable to obtain offsetting positions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we face credit liquidity and fraud risks from our agents consumers businesses and thirdparty processors that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to credit risk in our international payments provider business relating to a derivatives written by us to our customers and b the extension of trade credit when transactions are paid to recipients prior to our receiving cleared funds from the sending customers the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or 

to maintain appropriate collateral with us if a customer becomes insolvent files for bankruptcy commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with a financial institution counterparty for the derivatives or may bear financial risk for those receivables where we have offered trade credit 

if we are unable to maintain our relationships with banks needed to conduct our services or fail to comply with our contract requirements our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

in our international payments provider business we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions primarily crossborder crosscurrency transactions for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations increased regulation and compliance requirements are impacting these businesses by making it more costly for us to provide our services or by making it more cumbersome for businesses to do business with us any factors that increase the cost of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical such as trade policy or higher tariffs could negatively impact our revenues and harm our business we may also have difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships needed to conduct our services due to banks’ policies if we are unable to maintain our current business or banking relationships or establish new relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place our ability to continue to offer our services may be adversely impacted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions   

 in addition delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock and us these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 

we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

we currently expect to retain all future earnings if any for future operation expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our operating results financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in addition we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various pending and potential legal actions arbitration proceedings claims subpoenas and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations collectively legal proceedings based on our current knowledge management presently does not believe that the liabilities arising from these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period

estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been resolved for these reasons we are currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matters described above

executive overview 

we operate in two segments which we refer to as our north america and international segments our revenue is generally reported net of the cost for underlying products and services in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue see “results of operations” for additional segment information 

results presented for 2018 reflect the impact of the companys adoption of accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 asc 606 and related cost capitalization guidance which was adopted by the company on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method the adoption of topic 606 resulted in the classification of certain amounts previously classified as merchant commissions and processing expense net with revenues as a result of the application of the modified retrospective transition method the companys prior period results within its annual report on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q will not be restated to reflect the impact of topic 606 

the adoption of topic 606 had the impact of reducing revenues by approximately 1120 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  such expenses were not reflected as a reduction of revenues in the 2017 and 2016 amounts presented this lack of comparability should be considered in reviewing the transaction analysis and the various breakdowns of revenue by geography product and source in this discussion and analysis 

revenues net by segment for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  our north america and international segments generated the following revenue in millions 

  

revenues net net income and net income per diluted share  set forth below are revenues net net income and net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in millions except per share amounts 

                          

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share  set forth below are adjusted revenues adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in millions except per share amounts   



adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental nongaap financial measures of operating performance see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures” for more information and a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis 

sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer utilizing one of our payment products at a participating merchant the following diagram illustrates a typical transaction flow which is representative of many but not all of our businesses 

illustrative transaction flow 

the revenue we derive from transactions is generated from both customers and merchants customers may include commercial businesses obtained through direct and indirect channels as well as partners for whom we manage payment programs merchants who may also be customers under relevant accounting guidance may inc lude  those merchants affiliated with our proprietary networks or those participating in the thirdparty networks we utilize 

from our customers and partners we generate revenue through a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and charges these fees may be charged as fixed amounts costs plus a markup or based on a percentage of the transaction purchase amounts or a combination thereof our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk 

from our merchants and thirdparty networks we generate revenue mostly from the difference between the amount charged to a customer and the amount paid to the merchant or network for a given transaction as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses the amount paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale product cost plus a markup ii the transaction purchase amount less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase amount less a fixed fee per unit 

for a transaction involving the purchase of fuel where the amount paid to the merchant is calculated under the cost plus markup model we refer to the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the merchant as revenue tied to fuelprice spreads in all other cases we refer to the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the merchant for a given transaction as interchange revenue 

revenue per transaction  set forth below is revenue per transaction by segment information for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  revenue per transactions by segment is affected by the mix of products and acquisitions as well as the impact of the adoption of asc 606 which may result in revenue per transaction by product providing more meaningful data for analysis

the following table provides a breakdown of revenue per transaction by product and organic growth by product for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 in millions except per transaction data 



revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and the overall macroeconomic environment including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and fuel spread margins revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases as macroeconomic factors change and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates see “results of operations” for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction

sources of liquidity at december 31 2018  our cash balances totaled 13649 million  with approximately 3337 million  restricted restricted cash represents customer deposits in the czech republic and in our comdata business in the us as well 

as collateral received from customers for crosscurrency transactions in our cambridge business which are restricted from use other than to repay customer deposits as well as secure and settle crosscurrency transactions 

at december 31 2018  cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested was 7024 million all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries excluding restricted cash are available for general corporate purposes our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time we currently believe that funds generated from our us operations along with available borrowing capacity in the us will be sufficient to fund our us operations for the foreseeable future and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our us operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 the us government enacted the tax act which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions our final calculation of the onetime transition tax liability as a result of the tax act was 992 million  as permitted by the tax act we began to pay the onetime transition tax in eight annual interestfree installments beginning in 2018 at december 31 2018 we have remaining payments outstanding of 834 million 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic receivables to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants before collecting the receivable as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions at december 31 2018  we had no additional liquidity under our securitization facility at december 31 2018  we had approximately 2496 million available under our credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

  

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased from 6801 million  in 2017  to 9034 million  in 2018  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income and the change in deferred income taxes due to the impact of the tax act in 2017 partially offset by unfavorable working capital adjustments primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments in 2018  

net cash provided by operating activities decreased from 7082 million  in 2016 to 6801 million  in 2017 operating cash flows were primarily affected by higher net income and deferred income taxes resulting from enactment of the tax act also included in cash flows from operating activities were unfavorable working capital adjustments primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments in 2017 over the comparable period in 2016 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased from 4978 million  in 2017  to 263 million  in 2018  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in cash outlay for acquisitions also the proceeds received from the sale of our nextraq business in 2017 was much higher than those from the sale of chevron in 2018 

net cash used in investing activities decreased from 14 billion in 2016 to 4978 million in 2017 this decrease was primarily due to reduction in cash outlay for acquisitions and the proceeds received from the sale of our nextraq business during the third quarter of 2017 

financing activities net cash used in financing activities was 5778 million  in 2018  compared to net cash provided of 2519 million  in 2017  the increased use of cash is primarily due to increased spending to repurchase our common stock of 5563 million  in 2018  over 2017  a reduction in net borrowings of 1479 million  on our credit facility and a reduction in net borrowings of 1450 million  on our securitization facility 

net cash provided by financing activities decreased from 7540 million in 2016 to 2519 million in 2017 the decrease is primarily due to additional repayments on our credit facility of 5998 million in 2017 over 2016 and increased spending to repurchase our common stock of 2147 million partially offset by an increase in borrowings of 243 million on our securitization facility and an increase in borrowings of 555 million on our credit facility

our capital expenditures increased from 701 million  in 2017  to 814 million  in 2018  an increase of 11 million  or 161  this increase is primarily due to increased spending on strategic projects including continued investment in our operating systems as well as incremental spending related to acquisitions in 2016 and 2017

stock repurchase program 

on february 4 2016  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program the program under which we may purchase up to an aggregate of 500 million  of our common stock over the following 18 months  period on july 27 2017  our board of directors authorized an increase in the size of the program by an additional 250 million  and an extension of the program by an additional 18 months  on november 1 2017  we announced that our board of directors had authorized an additional increase in the size of the program by an another 350 million  and on july 17 2018 our board of directors authorized an additional increase of 500 million in the size of the program with the increase and giving effect to 15 billion  of previous repurchases we may repurchase up to 551 million  in shares of our common stock at any time prior to february 1 2020 

any stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as deemed appropriate the timing and amount of stock repurchases if any will depend on a variety of factors including the stock price market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements and any additional constraints related to material inside information we may possess any repurchases have been and are expected to be funded by a combination of available cash flow from the business working capital and debt 

on august 3 2017 as part of the program we entered an accelerated share repurchase agreement 2017 asr agreement with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 250 million of our common stock pursuant to the 2017 asr agreement we delivered 250 million in cash and received 1491647 shares based on a stock price of 14246 on august 7 2017 the 2017 asr agreement was completed on september 7 2017 at which time we received 263012 additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of 14248 

on december 14 2018 as part of the program we entered an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement 2018 asr agreement with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 220 million  of our common stock pursuant to the 2018 asr agreement we delivered 220 million  in cash and received 1057035  shares based on a stock price of 17691  on december 14 2018 the 2018 asr agreement was completed on january 29 2019 at which time we received 117751  additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of 18727  

we accounted for the 2017 and 2018 asr agreements as two  separate transactions i as shares of reacquired common stock for the shares delivered to us upon effectiveness of each asr agreement and ii as a forward contract indexed to the our common stock for the undelivered shares the initial delivery of shares was included in treasury stock at cost and results in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share the forward contracts indexed to the companys own common stock met the criteria for equity classification and these amounts were initially recorded in additional paidin capital 

since the beginning of the program 9025542  shares for an aggregate purchase price of 15 billion  have been repurchased there were 4911438  common shares totaling 9587 million  2854959 common shares totaling 4024 million and 1259145 common shares totaling 1877 million repurchased under the program during 2018  2017 and 2016 respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition and presentation we provide payment solutions to our business merchant consumer and payment network customers our payment solutions are primarily focused on specific commercial spend categories including fuel lodging tolls and general corporate payments as well as gift card solutions stored value cards we provide products that help businesses of all sizes control simplify and secure payment of various domestic and crossborder payables using specialized payment products we also provide other payment solutions for fleet maintenance employee benefits and long haul transportationrelated services 

payment services 

our primary performance obligation for the majority of our payment solution products fuel lodging corporate payments among others is to standready to provide authorization and processing services payment services for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions and the consideration received is contingent upon the customer’s use eg number of transactions submitted and processed of the related payment services accordingly the total transaction price is variable payment services involve a series of distinct daily services that are substantially the same with the same pattern of transfer to the customer for the tolls payment solution the companys primary performance obligation is to standready each month to provide access to the toll network and process toll transactions each period of access is determined to be distinct and substantially the same as the customer benefits over the period of access 

we record revenue for our payment services net of i the cost of the underlying products and services ii assessments and other fees charged by the credit and debit payment networks along with any rebates provided by them iii customer rebates and other discounts and iv taxes assessed eg vat and vatlike taxes by a government imposed concurrent with a revenue producing transaction 

the majority of the transaction price we receive for fulfilling the payment services performance obligation are comprised of one or a combination of the following 1 interchange fees earned from the payment networks 2 discount fees earned from merchants 3 fees calculated based on a number of transactions processed 4 fees calculated based upon a percentage of the transaction value for the underlying goods or services ie fuel food toll and transportation cards and vouchers and 5 monthly access fees 

we recognize revenue when the underlying transactions are complete and our performance obligations are satisfied transactions are considered complete depending upon the related payment solution but generally when we have authorized the transaction validated that the transaction has no errors and accepted and posted the data to our records 

our performance obligation for our foreign exchange payment services is providing a foreign currency payment to a customer’s designated recipient and therefore we recognize revenue on foreign exchange payment services when the underlying payment is made revenues from foreign exchange payment services are primarily comprised of the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market 

gift card products and services 

our gift product line delivers both stored value cards and cardbased services primarily in the form of gift cards to retailers these activities each represent performance obligations that are separate and distinct revenue for stored valued cards are recognized gross of the underlying cost of the related card recorded within processing expense within the consolidated statements of income at the point in time when control passes to our customer which is generally upon shipment 

cardbased services consist of transaction processing and reporting of gift card transactions where we recognize revenue based on an output measure of elapsed time for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions as a result we allocate and recognize variable consideration over the estimated period of time over which the performance obligation is satisfied 

other 

we account for revenue from late fees and finance charges in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations primarily in the us and canada in accordance with asc 310 receivables such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed and services are provided we cease billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 30  40 days after the customer’s balance becomes delinquent 

we also write foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments in foreign currencies and recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative fair value and derivative accounting asc 815 derivatives 

revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment in certain of our businesses which is recognized at the time the device is sold and control has passed to the customer this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues net within the consolidated statements of income the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within processing expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

revenues from contracts with customers within the scope of topic 606 represents approximately 80  of total consolidated revenues net the year ended december 31 2018  

contract liabilities 

deferred revenue contract liabilities for customers subject to asc 606 were 306 million and 302 million as of december 31 2018  and january 1 2018 respectively we expect to recognize substantially all of these amounts in revenues within approximately 12 months revenue recognized for the year ended december 31 2018  that was included in the deferred revenue contract liability as of january 1 2018 was approximately 266 million  

costs to obtain or fulfill a contract 

with the adoption of asc 606 we began capitalizing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs the incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those that we incur to obtain a contract with a customer that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained for example a sales commission 

costs incurred to fulfill a contract are capitalized if those costs meet all of the following criteria 

 in order to determine the appropriate amortization period for contract costs we considered a combination of factors including customer attrition rates estimated terms of customer relationships the useful lives of technology used by us to provide products and services to our customers whether further contract renewals are expected and if there is any incremental commission to be paid on a contract renewal contract acquisition and fulfillment costs are amortized using the straightline method over the expected period of benefit ranging from five to ten years costs to obtain a contract with an expected period of benefit of one 

year or less are recognized as an expense when incurred the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with sales commissions that qualify for capitalization will be recorded as selling expense in our consolidated statements of income the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with cash payments for client incentives is included as a reduction of revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2018  amortization of capitalized contract costs recorded in selling expense was 12 million 

costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are classified as contract cost assets within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2018  we had capitalized costs to obtain a contract of 127 million  within prepaid expenses and 345 million  within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets respectively 

we have recorded 839 million  969 million  and 916 million  of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

practical expedients 

asc 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations however as allowed by asc 606 we elected to exclude this disclosure for any contracts with an original duration of one year or less and any variable consideration that meets specified criteria as described above our most significant performance obligations consist of variable consideration under a standready series of distinct days of service such variable consideration meets the specified criteria for the disclosure exclusion therefore the majority of the aggregate amount of transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied is variable consideration that is not required for this disclosure the aggregate fixed consideration portion of customer contracts with an initial contract duration greater than one year is not material 

we elected to exclude all sales taxes and other similar taxes from the transaction price accordingly we present all collections from customers for these taxes on a net basis rather than having to assess whether we are acting as an agent or a principal in each taxing jurisdiction 

in certain arrangements with customers we determined that certain promised services and products are immaterial in the context of the contract both quantitatively and qualitatively 

as a practical expedient we are not required to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect at contract inception that the period between when we transfer a promised service or product to a customer and when the customer pays for the service or product will be one year or less as of december 31 2018  our contracts with customers did not contain a significant financing component 

we adopted topic 606 as of january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption for contracts that were modified before the effective date we utilized a practical expedient to consider the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations and allocating transaction price 

accounts receivable as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is 12 billion  accounts receivable collateralized within our securitization facility relate to trade receivables resulting from charge card activity in the us pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a revolving basis to fleetcor funding llc funding a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary in turn funding transfers without recourse on a revolving basis an undivided ownership interest in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit conduit funding maintains a subordinated interest in the form of overcollateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper 

we utilize proceeds from the transfer of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of financing to reduce our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable subject to a maximum amount 

our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income reflect the activity related to securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt including interest income fees generated from late payments provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense the cash flows from borrowings and repayments associated with the securitized debt are presented as cash flows from financing activities 

foreign receivables are not included in our receivable securitization program at december 31 2018  and 2017  there was 886 million  and 811 million  respectively of shortterm debt outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers payments from customers are generally due within 14 days or less of billing we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible from the customer once they age past 90 days we also provide an allowance for receivables aged less than 90 days that we expect will be uncollectible based on historical collections experience including accounts that have filed for bankruptcy at december 31 2018  approximately 99  of outstanding accounts receivable were current accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency recoveries from the thirdparty collection agency are not significant 

impairment of longlived assets intangibles and investments we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable when factors indicate that these longlived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such longlived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable a writedown to fair value is recorded fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may warrant revision 

we complete an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level we first perform a qualitative assessment of certain of its reporting units factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required we then perform the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired 

based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively on october 1 2018 we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of this most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investments which are not carried at fair value for impairment we have elected to measure certain equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for similar investments of the issuer 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

current accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax act as a result of the tax act the us federal corporate tax rate was reduced from 35 to 21 the tax act also includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions we recognized a deferred tax benefit of 210 million  to reflect the reduced us tax rate and other effects of the tax act as of december 31 2017 the final deferred tax benefit was adjusted to 2029 million during the oneyear measurement period the reduced benefit on deferred taxes was driven by the reduced federal benefit received on state income taxes as a result of the lower federal tax rate enacted by the tax act we recognized a provisional net tax benefit of 1282 million as of december 31 2017 during the tax year ended december 31 2018 the company finalized its accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act in accordance with its understanding of the tax act and the guidance available as of the date of this filing after the adjustments recognized during 2018 the overall net tax benefit of the tax act was adjusted to 1037 million the accounting for the tax effects of the tax act has been completed as of december 31 2018 see note 12 for further information regarding income taxes 

business combinations business combinations completed by us have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date for significant acquisitions we obtain independent thirdparty valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist us in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction 

estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provisional estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the final amounts recorded the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and is remeasured each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income we estimate the fair value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration using various valuation approaches as well as significant unobservable inputs reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 

stockbased compensation we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to five years and vesting of the options is generally based on the passage of time or performance stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options option forfeitures are accounted for upon occurrence we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time or performance or a combination of these shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one to three years the fair value of restricted stock where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock 

for performancebased restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

derivatives we use derivatives to facilitate crosscurrency corporate payments by writing derivatives to customers with our cambridge business we use derivatives to facilitate crosscurrency corporate payments by writing derivatives to customers which are not designated as hedging instruments the majority of cambridges revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments in addition cambridge also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for its customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one  year we aggregate our foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including forwards options and spot exchanges of currency and hedges economic hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties the changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in revenues net in the consolidated statements of income 

we recognize all derivatives in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their fair value all cash flows associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed the company’s management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

accounting for leases in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which requires lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for leases this asu also requires disclosures to provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements this asu is effective for us for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods therein on july 31 2018 the fasb issued asu 201811 “leases topic 842 targeted improvements” which provides 1 an optional transition method that entities can use when adopting asc 842 and 2 a practical expedient that permits lessors to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component if certain conditions are met under this new transition method an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption we will elect this transition method at the adoption date of january 1 2019 and will not restate comparative periods prior comparative periods will be reported under asc 840 we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which among other things allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification we also expect to make an accounting policy election to use the short term lease exception and will not record a rightofuseasset and lease liability on the balance sheet for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less we will recognize those lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straightline basis over the lease term we have analyzed our lease portfolio as well as our accounting policies and internal controls that will be impacted by the new guidance we have also implemented lease accounting software to support the new reporting requirements while certain adoption procedures are ongoing including the discount rate determination and validating our completeness of the lease population we do not believe the new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or liquidity the standard will have no impact on our debtcovenant compliance under our current agreements we are still in the process of finalizing the impact on the consolidated financial statements

recently adopted accounting standards 

impact of adoption of asc 606 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 which replaces numerous requirements in us gaap including industryspecific requirements and provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers the core principle of asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the two permitted transition methods under the standard are the full retrospective method in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown or the modified retrospective method in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application asu 201409 as amended by asu 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date is effective for years beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods with early adoption permitted for years beginning after december 15 2016 since the issuance of asu 201409 the fasb has issued additional interpretive guidance including new accounting standard updates ans asc subtopic 34040 other assets and deferred costs  contracts with customers which clarifies certain points of the standard and modifies certain requirements 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606   using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of the date of initial application resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on january 1 2018 for contracts that were modified before january 1 2018 we have not retrospectively restated contracts for those modifications but instead reflected the aggregate effect of these modifications when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations as allowed within the transition practical expedients the cumulative impact to retained earnings at january 1 2018 was 302 million  due to the capitalization of costs to acquire contracts under the new standard with a corresponding increase to prepaid expense and other current assets of 102 million  other assets of 303 million  and deferred income taxes liabilities of 103 million  over the respective implied period of benefit additionally under the new standard certain costs eg merchant commissions and fees paid to credit card associations will be presented net in revenues as the amounts represent payments to our customers that are not considered in exchange for a distinct good or service that the customer transfers to us 

the impact to the our revenue operating expenses income from continuing operations after taxes net income and basic and diluted earnings per share eps for the year ended december 31 2018  was as follows 



the adoption of asc 606 did not impact our accounting for revenues derived from late fees finance charges and certain other charge card fees or certain of our foreign currency contracts which continue to be accounted for under existing authoritative guidance as discussed further footnote 3 to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 

intraentity transfers 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 “income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory” the new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer other 

than transfers of inventory when the transfer occurs for intercompany transfers of inventory the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party the company adopted this asu on january 1 2018 which resulted in an increase of approximately 171 million  to retained earnings and an increase of 259 million  to deferred tax assets and reduced prepaid tax by 88 million 

accounting for breakage 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201604 “liabilitiesextinguishments of liabilities recognition of breakage for certain prepaid storedvalue products” which requires entities that sell prepaid stored value products redeemable for goods services or cash at thirdparty merchants to derecognize liabilities related to those products for breakage this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 the asu must be adopted using either a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption or a full retrospective approach the company adopted this guidance on january 1 2018 which did not have a material impact on the companys results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

cash flow classification 

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments which amends the guidance in asc 230 statement of cash flows this amended guidance reduces the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable the company adopted this new guidance on january 1 2018 the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash which amends the guidance in asc 230 statement of cash flows on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and changes due to adoption are applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented the company adopted this new guidance on january 1 2018 and applied retrospectively to results for 2017 the adoption of topic 230 resulted in the statement of cash flows presenting the changes in the total of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 

intangibles  goodwill and other impairment 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill ie step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to measure a goodwill impairment charge instead entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value ie measure the charge based on step 1 the standard has tiered effective dates starting in 2020 for calendaryear public business entities that meet the definition of an sec filer early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment testing dates after january 1 2017 the adoption of this asu on january 1 2018 did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

definition of a business 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201701 clarifying the definition of a business which amends the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business the guidance requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets if so the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business the guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs the guidance is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those years the company adopted this new guidance on january 1 2018 the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

accounting for modifications to stockbased compensation 

in may 2017 the fasb issued asu 201709 compensation—stock compensation topic 718 scope of modification accounting which amends the scope of modification accounting for sharebased payment arrangements the asu provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of sharebased payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under asc 718 specifically an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value vesting conditions and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification the guidance is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within 

those years the company adopted this new guidance on january 1 2018 the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions by product we define the pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as revenue net as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate the impact of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of acquisitions dispositions and the impact of adoption of asc 606 the macroeconomic environment includes the impact that market fuel spread margins fuel prices and foreign exchange rates have on our business we use pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to evaluate the organic growth in our revenue and the associated transactions set forth 

below is a reconciliation of pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenue net and transactions in millions

 columns may not calculate due to rounding 

1  other includes telematics maintenance food and transportation related businesses 

2  adjustments related to onetime items not representative of normal business operations 

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stock based compensation expense related to share based compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs discounts and intangible assets amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment and c other nonrecurring items including the impact of the 2017 tax act impairment charges asset writeoffs restructuring costs gains due to disposition of assets and a business loss on extinguishment of debt legal settlements and the unauthorized access costs 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income we also believe onetime nonrecurring gains losses and impairment charges do not necessarily reflect how our investments and business are performing we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

  






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

foreign earnings 

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 354  365  and 302  of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2018  were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2018  by approximately 417 million  had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2017  and 2016  were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  by approximately 342 million  and 248 million  respectively 

unhedged crosscurrency risk 

with the acquisition of cambridge in august 2017 we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our international payments provider business the majority of cambridges revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments in addition cambridge also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year cambridge aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including the derivative contracts described above and hedges economic hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt we use our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or to invest in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes our 416 billion credit agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a revolving a credit facility in the amount of 1285 billion  a term loan a facility in the amount of 253 billion  and a term loan b facility in the amount of 3500 million  as of december 31 2018  the revolving credit facility consists of a a revolving a facility in the amount of 8000 million with sublimits for letters of credit and swing line loans b a revolving b facility in the amount of 4500 million with multicurrency borrowings and a sublimit for swing line loans and c a revolving c facility in the amount of 350 million for borrowings in us dollars australian dollars or new zealand dollars 

interest on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement other than the term b loan accrues based on the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050  b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100  plus a margin based on a leverage ratio interest on the term b loan facility accrues based on the eurocurrency rate plus 200  for eurocurrency loans and at the base rate plus 100  for base rate loans in addition the company pays a quarterly commitment fee at a rate per annum ranging from 020  to 040  of the daily unused portion of the credit facility 

based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense   would have changed by approximately 379 million 347 million and 279 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

on january 22 2019 we entered into three  interest rate swap cash flow contracts with us dollar notional amounts of 1 billion  with a fixed rate of 256  500 million  with a fixed rate of 256  and 500 million  with a fixed rate of 255  the 

purpose of these contracts is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in interest payments associated with 2 billion  of our variable rate debt the sole source of which is due to changes in the 1month libor benchmark interest rate 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price

our payment products typically function like a charge card or prepaid card fleetcor provides a variety of payment mechanisms such as a plastic card electronic tag or other form to the customer we issue credit to the customer or accept prepaid funds from the customer to allow for purchases using the payment product fleetcor then reports the purchases to the customer and invoices or debits prepaid amounts for payment of purchases made on the customer’s account

we support our payment products with specialized issuing processing and information services that enable us to manage customer accounts facilitate the routing authorization clearing and settlement of transactions and provide valueadded functionality and data including customizable userlevel controls and productivity analysis tools our customers can use these data controls and tools to lower their operating costs and combat fraud and employee misuse and streamline expense administration 

depending on our customers’ and partners’ needs we provide our products and services in a variety of combinations ranging from a comprehensive “endtoend” solution encompassing issuing processing and network services to limited back office processing services 

our solutions tend to be specialized for specific spend categories such as fuel or lodging andor specific customer segments such as long haul transportation this specialization is manifested in the purchase controls merchant network and reporting applicable to the spend category or customer segment for example a fuel card could provide controls on the type of fuel purchased be accepted only at gas stations for fuel purchases and provide fuel usage and efficiency reports for a customer’s fleet of vehicles the combination of these specialized attributes allows our payment products to compete well against less specialized products such as cash or general purpose credit cards when it comes to controlling purchases within certain spend categories 

fleetcor’s five primary product lines are fuel lodging tolls corporate payments and gift additionally we provide other payment products including fleet maintenance employee benefits and long haul transportationrelated services 

fuel payment product line

fleetcor offers fuel payment solutions to businesses and government entities who operate vehicle fleets as well as to major oil companies leasing companies and fuel marketers our fuel payment products are most often in the form of plastic cards but also include other forms such as electronic rfid tags and paper vouchers while predominately used to purchase fuel many of our fuel payment products have additional purchasing capabilities to allow customers to purchase nonfuel items such as oil vehicle maintenance supplies and services and building supplies

credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 

the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 is an act that among other things amended provisions of tila that affect consumer credit and also directed the federal reserve board to study the use of credit cards by small businesses and to make legislative recommendations the report concluded that it is not clear whether the potential benefits outweigh the increased cost and reduced credit availability if the disclosure and substantive restrictions applicable to consumer cards were to be applied to small business cards legislation has been introduced from time to time to increase the protections afforded to small businesses that use payment cards if legislation of this kind were enacted our products and services for small businesses could be adversely impacted

nonbanks that provide certain financial services are required to register with the financial crimes enforcement network of the us department of the treasury fincen as “money services businesses” msbs through certain subsidiaries we are 

registered as msbs as a result we have established antimoney laundering compliance programs that include i internal policies and controls ii designation of a compliance officer iii ongoing employee training and iv an independent review function we have developed and implemented compliance programs comprised of policies procedures systems and internal controls to monitor and address various legal requirements and developments 

in addition provisions of the bsa known as the prepaid access rule issued by fincen impose certain obligations such as registration and collection of consumer information on “providers” of certain prepaid access programs including the stored value products issued by our sponsor banks for which we serve as program manager fincen has taken the position that where the issuing bank has principal oversight and control of such prepaid access programs no other participant in the distribution chain would be required to register as a provider under the prepaid access rule despite this position we have opted to register as a provider of prepaid access through our subsidiary comdata inc we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the ofac that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the cfpb which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit in addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb is authorized to issue rules prohibiting unfair deceptive and abusive acts and practices udaap by persons offering consumer financial products or services and their service providers and has authority to enforce these consumer financial protection laws and cfpb rules the cfpb has not defined what is a consumer financial product or service but has indicated informally that in some instances small businesses may be covered under consumer protection 

as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we may be subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs 

in addition the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the federal reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing clearing and settling the transaction payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions in july 2011 the federal reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees effective in october 2011 with certain exceptions debit interchange rates are capped at 021 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus for qualifying issuing financial institutions an additional 001 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations because we qualify for an exemption for the majority of our debit transactions 

the implementation of the doddfrank act is ongoing and as a result its overall impact remains unclear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that it is possible that we could be further directly or indirectly impacted

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see note regarding forwardlooking statements in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2017  approximately 13  our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

  

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 10  of our consolidated revenue in 2017  was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not creditworthy or are fraudulently completed changes in our industry customer demand and in relation to our fleet customers movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result could lead to increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition our bad debt expense was 449 million  in 2017 and 359 million  in 2016 or 7 bps in 2017 and 8 bps in 2016 respectively 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments revenues for late fees and finance charges represent 6  of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity or the extent to which they use optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer in the fleet card business our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers in the commercial payments business we face a variety of competitors some of which have greater financial resources name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of fleet cards and vouchers for food fuel tolls and transportation and major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers who offer commercial fleet cards 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources than we do in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers such as treasury management commercial lending and credit card processing by providing these services that we do not provide these competitors have an advantage of being able to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships sometimes at a discount for example in the commercial payments business we compete with full service banks that are able to offer treasury management and commercial lending in addition to commercial payment solutions if price competition continues to intensify we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers decrease the prices of our products and services or lose customers each of which could adversely affect our operating results in the fleet card business major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as well as offer addon complementary services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies and to establish additional relationships with other petroleum marketers we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” we use this term in the business sense to refer to strategic business relationships formed through contracts such as card program agreements and not in the legal sense of operating under legal partnership arrangements created pursuant to laws such as the uniform partnership act during 2017  our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for less than 6 of our consolidated revenue our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from about one to six years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected also our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in 2016 we received notice from an oil partner that they did not intend to renew our current contract when it expired at the end of 2017 additionally in 2017 we signed an agreement to extend the management of the commercial fuel card program for a strategic partner we do not expect these contracts to have a material impact on our business and operating results 

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base in the closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel maintenance services and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected 

with respect to the closed loop networks we utilize a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants and service garages typically have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew on the same basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships failure to continue such relationships on similarly attractive economic terms the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

we depend on our relationships with major truck stop merchants to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers we must maintain these relationships to effectively serve our customers that use these merchants if we are unable to maintain these relationships our overtheroad fuel card businesses may be adversely affected 

we have long standing relationships with major truck stop merchants to accept our overtheroad fuel cards overtheroad customers purchase a significant proportion of their fuel at major truck stop merchants the loss of existing major truck stop 

merchant relationships or failure to continue such relationships on similar terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other business related products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the us and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the us europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other business related products and services by our customers the commercial payments industry in general and our commercial payment solutions business specifically depends heavily upon the overall level of spending unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession political climate or other changes may lead our corporate customers to reduce their spending resulting in reduced demand for or use of our products and services in addition unfavorable changes in economic conditions may lead our fleet card customers to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services as a result a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the us or abroad could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase a weakening economy could also force some retailers and merchants to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and transaction declines in addition demand for fuel and other business related products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration of current economic conditions in the us europe russia latin america australia and new zealand as a result weaknesses in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example we have entered into the corporate payments stored value card vehicle maintenance management and telematics business in the us and europe and transaction processing fuel food toll and transportation card and voucher businesses in brazil and mexico we may continue to enter into new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis 

the products we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions all at high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we may rely on third parties to develop or codevelop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms or at all and these relationships may not be successful in addition partners some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties even if we are successful in developing new services and technologies these new services and technologies may not achieve broad acceptance due to a 

variety of factors including a lack of industrywide standards competing products and services or resistance to these changes from our customers in addition we may not be able to derive revenue from these efforts 

if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2017  we had approximately 447 billion  of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew every three years 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a three year term although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually in the past there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us for example the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility during the financial crisis that began in 2008 also a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no 

assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest we renewed our securitization facility as of november 14 2017 with an expiration date of november 14 2020 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 37  of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound brazilian real canadian dollar russian ruble mexican peso czech koruna euro australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer in the us and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

  



in addition the integration process following an acquisition requires significant management attention and resources integration of acquisitions could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies on our services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the us 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in australia austria azerbaijan belarus belgium brazil bulgaria canada croatia czech republic denmark estonia finland france georgia germany gibraltar greece hong kong hungary ireland italy kazakhstan latvia lithuania luxembourg macau malaysia mexico moldova mongolia the netherlands new zealand norway pakistan papua new guinea peru philippines poland portugal romania russia singapore slovakia slovenia south africa south korea spain sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey ukraine united arab emirates and the united kingdom we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate such as russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the us for example russia and ukraine are experiencing significant unrest which could escalate into broader armed conflict and additional economic sanctions by the us united nations or other countries against russia in addition political discourse in the us may impact business practices in mexico and other jurisdictions in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet revenues from nonus operations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the us these include 

  



 in addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union and this uncertainty may persist for years a withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products including our products any of these effects among others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the us we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems telecommunications data centers and call centers including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to provide reliable service to customers cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data centers and call centers as well as thirdparty labor and services providers our business involves processing large numbers of transactions the movement of large sums of money and the management of large amounts of data we rely on the ability of our employees contractors suppliers systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure uninterrupted and errorfree manner 

our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors such as power availability telecommunications carrier redundancy embargoes and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries 

we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data however there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown security breach or catastrophic event such as fire explosion flood pandemic natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure or physical breakin we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our business depends heavily on the reliability of proprietary and thirdparty processing systems a system outage could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations including by damaging our reputation or exposing us to thirdparty liability to successfully operate our business we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption including from events that may be beyond our control events that could cause system interruptions include fire natural disaster unauthorized entry power loss telecommunications failure computer viruses terrorist acts and war although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures 

our products and services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that are constantly evolving we often encounter delays and cost overruns in developing changes implemented to our systems in addition the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation or exposure to liability claims in addition we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation of liability provisions in our licenses and other agreements with our customers we cannot assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers we do not maintain insurance to protect us against such losses we bear similar risk relating to fraudulent acts of employees or contractors for which we maintain insurance however the conditions or limits of coverage may be insufficient to protect us against such losses 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft a single significant incident of fraud or increases in the overall level of fraud involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions including significant monetary fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect our systems or the data we collect from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information social security numbers expense data and credit card debit card and checking account numbers we endeavor to keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations although we are not aware of any material breach of our or our associated third parties’ computer systems or material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches we and others in our industry are regularly the subject of attempts by bad actors to gain unauthorized access to these computer systems and data or to obtain change or destroy confidential data including personal consumer information of individuals through a variety of means including computer viruses malware and phishing 

because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our systems and the data we collect change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure computer viruses can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation 

and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to security and privacy that we impose on our service providers who have access to customer and consumer data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data in addition we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of customer data the costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability protracted and costly litigation governmental and card network intervention and fines and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers lost revenue and reputational harm 

in addition under payment network rules regulatory requirements and related obligations we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties such as third party service providers vendors partners and others which we refer to collectively as associated participants the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions and could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the market for our commercial payment fleet and stored value card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers if businesses do not continue to use or increase their use of credit debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe that future growth in the use of credit debit and stored value cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of services offered in order for us to consistently increase and maintain profitability businesses must continue to use and increase the use of electronic payment methods including credit debit and stored value cards moreover if there is an adverse development in the payments industry in general such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business or a wellpublicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally 

furthermore new technologies may displace credit debit andor stored value cards as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses a decline in the acceptance and use of credit debit andor stored value cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards food vouchers and cards transportation and toll road payments telematics solutions and fleet maintenance management services is also evolving and those portions of our business are subject to similar risks 

if we fail to retain any of our stored value gift card customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all which will reduce our revenue 

most of our stored value gift card customers in the us are national retailers during 2017  a majority of our gift card revenue was derived from the design and purchase of gift card inventory with the remaining portion of our 2017  gift card revenue derived primarily from processing fees if we fail to retain any of these customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all because there is a limited number of national retailers in the us and nearly all of those 

other national retailers already have a gift card solution in place either inhouse or with one of our competitors as such any loss of a stored value gift card customer would reduce our revenue 

adverse weather conditions across a geographic region can cause a decline in the number and amount of payment transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

when travel is severely curtailed across a geographic region during adverse weather conditions the number and amount of transactions we process can be significantly diminished particularly in our fleet business and revenue can materially decline for example during parts of january 2014 severe winter weather shut down a large portion of the eastern united states prolonged adverse weather events especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fuel card workforce payment solutions and gift card businesses’ results are subject to seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income 

our fuel card and workforce payment solutions businesses have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and profit which are impacted during the first and fourth quarter each year by the weather holidays in the us christmas being celebrated in russia in january and lower business levels in brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration our gift card business has experienced in the past and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns historically gift card business revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season  

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 66  of our total assets at december 31 2017  these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the us in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed 

furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we may agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

finally we use open source software in connection with our technology and services companies that incorporate open source software into their products from time to time face claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software open source software is also provided without warranty and may therefore include bugs security vulnerabilities or other defects some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software andor make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost while we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related technology or service such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the us and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

for example certain of our subsidiaries are currently licensed as money transmitters on the state level by the banking departments or other state agencies continued licensing by these states is subject to periodic examinations and ongoing satisfaction of compliance requirements regarding safety and soundness including maintenance of certain levels of net worth surety bonding permissible investments in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding payment obligations with respect to certain of our products subject to licensure and record keeping and reporting if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain maintain or renew necessary licenses or comply with other relevant state regulations they will not be able to operate as a money transmitter in those states or provide certain other services and products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the financial crimes enforcement network or fincen and must comply with applicable antimoney laundering requirements including implementation of an effective antimoney laundering program changes in this regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business 

regulatory changes may also restrict or eliminate present and future business opportunities available to certain of our subsidiaries for example the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act which serves to limit interchange fees may restrict or otherwise impact the way our subsidiaries do business or limit their ability to charge certain fees to customers the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb is also engaged in rule making and regulation of the payments industry in particular with respect to prepaid cards and in october 2016 the cfpb issued a final rule amending regulations e and z to create comprehensive consumer protections for prepaid financial products the extensive nature of these regulations and the implementation dates for this additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business the cfpb’s focus on the protection of consumers might also extend to many of our small business customers as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changing regulations or standards in the area of privacy and data protection could also adversely impact us in addition certain of our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authority and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

our business is subject to us federal antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bsa our business in canada is also subject to proceeds of crime money laundering and terrorist financing act or the pctfa which is a corollary to the bsa the bsa among other things requires money services businesses such as money transmitters issuers of money orders and official checks and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records the pctfa imposes similar requirements 

many of these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly with increasing frequency federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training monitoring and compliance including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and appropriate manner we may be subject to injunctions other sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties and our reputation may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

in addition recently implemented and pending changes in accounting standards for example changes relating to revenue recognition for customer contracts that will become effective for fiscal 2018 may adversely affect our results of operations 

finally we have endeavored to structure our businesses in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions payroll taxes and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws their interpretations or their enforcement could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition

derivatives regulations 

rules adopted under the doddfrank act by the commodity futures trading commission the cftc as well as the provisions of the european market infrastructure regulation and its technical standards which are directly applicable in the member states of the european union have subjected certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer to our customers as part of cambridges business to reporting recordkeeping and other requirements additionally certain foreign exchange derivatives transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing requirements or may be subject to margin requirements in the united states and european union other jurisdictions outside the united states and the european union are considering have implemented or are implementing regulations similar to those described above derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities as well as impact how we conduct our business within our international payments provider operations in particular the cftc has recently issued a proposed rule that if adopted as proposed would increase the likelihood that we will have to register one or more of our subsidiaries with the cftc as swap dealers swap dealers are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework and compliance with this framework will lead to additional costs including costs relating to regulatory capital and margin requirements and may impact how we conduct our hedging activities and derivatives business with customers we are currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule if adopted would have on our hedging activities and operations 

our compliance with these requirements has resulted and may continue to result in additional costs to our business and may impact our international payments provider business operations furthermore our failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines and other sanctions as well as necessitate a temporary or permanent cessation to some or all of our derivative related activities any such fines sanctions or limitations on our business could adversely affect our operations and financial results additionally the regulatory regimes for derivatives in the united states and european union such as under the doddfrank act and the european markets in financial instruments directive known as mifid ii are continuing to evolve and changes to such regimes our designation under such regimes or the implementation of new rules under such regimes such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts may result in additional costs to our business other jurisdictions outside the united states and the european union are considering have implemented or are implementing regulations similar to those described above and these may result in greater costs to us as well 

governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services 

governmental bodies in the us and abroad have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations restricting the transfer of and requiring safeguarding of nonpublic personal information for example in the us all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to help protect the privacy and security of consumer financial information in connection with providing services to our clients we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks our sponsor bank and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer information these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer personal information received from our customers our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level our compliance costs may increase our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations particularly related to privacy data protection and information security and we are subject to disparate consumer protection laws across different countries our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 

in the us the european union and in other jurisdictions around the world we are subject to numerous and disparate consumer laws including laws on disputed transactions as well as regulations on ecommerce or similar legislation if we are found to have breached any consumer ecommerce or similar legislation in any country we may be subject to enforcement actions that require us to change our business practices in a manner which may negatively impact revenue as well as litigation fines penalties and adverse publicity that could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business in a manner that harms our financial position 

we collect personally identifiable information and other data from our customers laws and regulations in several countries restrict certain collection processing storage use disclosure and security of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information several foreign countries and governmental bodies including the countries of the european union and canada have laws and regulations which are often more restrictive than those in the united states the data privacy regime in the eu includes certain directives which among other things require european union member states to regulate the processing and movement of personal data marketing and the use of cookies each european union member state has transposed the requirements of these directives into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time 

future restrictions on the collection use sharing or disclosure of personally identifiable information or additional requirements and liability for security and data integrity could require us to modify our solutions and features possibly in a material manner and could limit our ability to develop new services and features for example the euwide general data protection regulation or gdpr which was passed by the european union parliament in the spring of 2016 and will become fully effective in may 2018 following a twoyear implementation period will replace the data protection laws of each european union member state the gdpr will implement more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including for example increased requirements to erase an individual’s information upon request mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on service providers it also significantly increases penalties for noncompliance including where we act as a service provider  eg  data processor if our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations we may be subject to litigation regulatory investigations enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data or our marketing practices fines for example of up to 20000000 euros or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher under the gdpr or other liabilities as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business 

in february 2013 the european commission proposed euwide legislation regarding cybersecurity in the form of the proposed network and information security directive or the nis directive the nis directive requires eu member states to impose cybersecurity obligationsincluding data breach notification requirementsto operators of “essential services” and to “digital service providers” the nis directive and its implementing legislation if held to apply to us may lead to compliance obligations that require us to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business which could increase our operating costs and failure to comply may result in governmental enforcement actions litigation fines penalties and adverse publicity 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our acquisition documents include warranties covenants and conditions regarding various tax matters that occurred prior to the acquisition supported by indemnification and in some cases holdbacks or escrows from the sellers the obligations of the 

sellers are also generally subject to various limitations in the event of a tax claim related to a preacquisition tax year we would seek to recover costs and losses from the sellers under the acquisition agreement however there is no assurance that any indemnification holdback or escrow would be sufficient or that we would recover such costs or losses which could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results 

the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act the tax act act could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code the newly enacted tax act among other things contains significant changes to corporate taxation including by reducing the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat rate of 21 significantly limiting the tax deduction for net interest expense limiting the deduction for post2017 net operating losses to 80 of current year taxable income and eliminating carrybacks of such net operating losses imposing a onetime transition tax on offshore earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated migrating from a “worldwide” system of taxation in the direction of a territorial system subject to certain important exceptions allowing immediate expensing of certain new investments instead of depreciating such investments over time modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits and requiring the accrual of certain income for us federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is taken into account as revenue on our financial statements subject to an exception for certain income that is already subject to a special method of accounting under the code we continue to examine the impact the new legislation may have on our business notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law the impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor material adverse effects on our business 

we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our current and past operations including employmentrelated disputes contract disputes intellectual property disputes government audits and regulatory proceedings customer disputes and tort claims responding to proceedings may be difficult and expensive and we may not prevail in some proceedings the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief which if granted would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings regardless of whether we prevail or not such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have had and expect to continue to receive inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our 

business such inquiries have resulted in and may continue to result in various audits reviews and investigations which can be time consuming and expensive these types of inquiries audits reviews and investigations could result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties changes in personnel and increased review and scrutiny by customers regulatory authorities the media and others which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations for more information about our judicial and other proceedings see “business—legal proceedings” 

we are named in a federal securities class action lawsuit and derivative complaint if we are unable to resolve these matters favorably then our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

in june 2017 a shareholder filed a class action complaint in the unites states district court for the northern district of georgia against the company and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s stock between february 5 2016 and may 2 2017 in july 2017 a shareholder derivative complaint was filed against certain of the company’s directors and officers in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia seeking recovery on behalf of the company see “part iiitem 3  legal proceedings” below for additional information about the lawsuit and the derivative complaint we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these matters or reasonably determine the probability of a material adverse result or reasonably estimate range of potential exposure if any that these matters might have on us our business our financial condition or our results of operations although such effects could be materially adverse in addition in the future we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to these matters further regardless of how these matters proceed it could divert our management’s attention and other resources away from our business 

our revenues from mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of mastercard it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations through our financial institution sponsors 

a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the us and canada registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive even if we pursue sponsorship by alternative member banks similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist   in addition mastercard routinely updates and modifies its requirements changes in the requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services if we do not comply with mastercard requirements it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registration which allows us to process transactions on its networks the termination of our registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers which would have a material adverse effect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network card transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of 

our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the fcpa antimoney laundering regulations economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws and regulations associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the fcpa the uk bribery act the 2013 brazilian clean companies act and the 2013 russian law on preventing corruption these laws and regulations generally prohibit us our employees consultants and agents from bribing being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition we are subject to antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bsa among other things the bsa requires money services businesses such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records 

we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by ofac which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals and with individuals and entities that are speciallydesignated nationals of those countries narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations other group entities may be subject to additional foreign or local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions 

similar antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations 

violations of these laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition likewise any investigation of any potential violations of these laws and regulations by us or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and operating results in addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws and regulations might be administered or interpreted 

global economic downturns or slower growth or declines in the money transfer payment service and other markets in which we operate including downturns or declines related to interruptions in migration patterns and difficult conditions in global financial markets and   financial market disruptions could adversely affect our business financial   condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global economy has experienced in recent years and may experience downturns volatility and disruption and we face certain risks relating to such events including 



hedging activity in our international payments provider business generally varies with currency volatility we have experienced and may experience in the future lower foreign exchange revenues in periods of lower currency volatility 

 risks associated with operations outside the us and foreign currencies could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our international payments provider business the majority of this business revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments additionally this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us 

our international payments provider business aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including the derivative contracts described above and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties if we are unable to obtain offsetting positions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

we face credit liquidity and fraud risks from our agents consumers businesses and thirdparty processors that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to credit risk in our international payments provider business relating to a derivatives written by us to our customers and b the extension of trade credit when transactions are paid to recipients prior to our receiving cleared funds from the sending customers the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or 

to maintain appropriate collateral with us if a customer becomes insolvent files for bankruptcy commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with a financial institution counterparty for the derivatives or may bear financial risk for those receivables where we have offered trade credit 

if we are unable to maintain our relationships with banks needed to conduct our services or fail to comply with our contract requirements our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

in our international payments provider business we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions primarily crossborder crosscurrency transactions for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations increased regulation and compliance requirements are impacting these businesses by making it more costly for us to provide our services or by making it more cumbersome for businesses to do business with us we may also have difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships needed to conduct our services due to banks’ policies if we are unable to maintain our current business or banking relationships or establish new relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place our ability to continue to offer our services may be adversely impacted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

  



 in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission the sec we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions   

 in addition delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock and us these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 

we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

we currently expect to retain all future earnings if any for future operation expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any decision to declare and pay 

dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our operating results financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in addition we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to various pending and potential legal actions arbitration proceedings claims subpoenas and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations collectively legal proceedings based on our current knowledge management presently does not believe that the liabilities arising from these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period 

shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 

on june 14 2017 a shareholder filed a class action complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia against the company and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s stock between february 5 2016 and may 2 2017 on october 13 2017 the shareholder filed an amended complaint asserting claims on behalf of a putative class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the companys common stock between february 4 2016 and may 3 2017 the complaint alleges that the defendants made false or misleading statements regarding fee charges and the reasons for its earnings and growth in certain press releases and other public statements in violation of the federal securities laws plaintiff seeks class certification unspecified monetary damages costs and attorneys’ fees the company disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the claims

estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been resolved for these reasons we are currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matters described above

adjusted revenues adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental nongaap financial measures of operating performance see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures” we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate thus we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis 

sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer utilizing one of our payment products at a participating merchant the following diagram illustrates a typical transaction flow which is representative of many but not all of our businesses 

illustrative transaction flow 

the revenue we derive from transactions is generated from both customers and merchants customers may include directly and indirectlysold commercial businesses as well as partners for whom we manage payment programs merchants may inc lude  those merchants affiliated with our proprietary networks or those participating in the thirdparty networks we utilize 

from our customers and partners we generate revenue through a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and charges these fees may be charged as fixed amounts costs plus a markup or based on a percentage of the transaction purchase amounts our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk 

from our merchants and thirdparty networks we generate revenue mostly from the difference between the amount charged to a customer and the amount paid to the merchant or network for a given transaction as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses the amount paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale product cost plus a markup ii the transaction purchase amount less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase amount less a fixed fee per unit the following table provides illustrations of these three merchant payment models which are representative of many but not all of our businesses 

illustrative merchant payment models 

  

for a transaction involving the purchase of fuel where the amount paid to the merchant is calculated under the cost plus markup model we refer to the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the merchant as merchant revenue tied to fuelprice spreads in all other cases we refer to the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the merchant for a given transaction as interchange revenue 

revenue per transaction  set forth below is revenue per transaction by segment information for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  revenue per transactions by segment is affected by the mix of products and acquisitions which may result in revenue per transaction by product providing more meaningful data for analysis 

  

the following table provides a breakdown of revenue per transaction by product for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  in millions except per transaction data 



    



revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and the overall macroeconomic environment including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates fuel prices and spreads revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases as macroeconomic factors change and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates see “results of operations” for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction

on september 30 2017 we entered into an amended masternaut investment agreement that resulted in the loss of significant influence and we began accounting for the masternaut investment by applying the cost method 

we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our masternaut investment and during the third quarter of 2017 we determined that the fair value of our 44 investment in masternaut had declined as a result of our loss of significant influence and the operating results of masternaut as a result we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value and concluded that this decline in value was other than temporary we recorded a 446 million impairment loss in the masternaut investment that includes adjustment for 314 million of currency translation losses previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions increased  from 1043 million  in 2016  to 1131 million  in 2017  an increase of 88 million  or 84  this increase  was primarily due to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel and the impact of higher volume in certain revenue streams where merchant commissions are paid 

processing processing expenses increased  from 3554 million  in 2016  to 4296 million  in 2017  an increase of 742 million  or 209  increases in processing expenses were primarily due to expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately 62 million as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates partially offset by the impact of negotiated lower vendor processing costs the increase  in bad debt was primarily due to bad debt inherent in the acquired stp business these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately 6 million 

selling  selling expenses increased  from 1314 million  in 2016  to 1707 million  in 2017  an increase of 393 million  or 299  increases in spending were primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately 26 million and additional spending in certain lines of business these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately 2 million 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased  from 2836 million  in 2016  to 3877 million  in 2017  an increase of 1041 million  or 367  the increase  was primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately 42 million increased  stock based compensation expense of approximately 30 million  and increases in other professional and legal fees totaling approximately 22 million these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately 2 million 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased  from 2033 million  in 2016  to 2646 million  in 2017  an increase of 613 million  or 302  the increase  was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately 47 million and increased capital spending these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately 4 million

other income expense net other income net was 1734 million  in 2017 compared to other expense net of 30 million  in 2016 the increase was due primarily to the pretax gain on the sale of our nextraq business of 175 million in 2017 

interest expense net interest expense increased  from 719 million  in 2016  to 1071 million  in 2017  an increase  of 353 million  or 490  the increase  in interest expense is primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings to finance the acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 share buybacks and increases in libor the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility excluding the related unused credit facility fees 

  

the average unused credit facility fee for domestic revolver a was 035  and 031  in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt of 33 million  relates to our writeoff of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility during the third quarter of 2017 

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased  from 1905 million  in 2016  to 1534 million  in 2017  a decrease  of 371 million  or 195  primarily driven by the impact of the enactment of the tax act partially offset by the increase in pretax book income for 2017 as compared to 2016 on december 22 2017 the us government enacted tax legislation referred to as the tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the transition tax can be paid over eight years 

also the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act in accordance with sab 118 we have a oneyear measurement period in which to complete our accounting for the tax act 

we have made an estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax which resulted in a provisional net tax benefit of 1282 million which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities after considering the us federal income tax rate reduction to 21 the onetime transition tax is based on our total post1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from us income taxes in 2017 we recorded a provisional amount for the onetime transition tax expense of 818 million net of foreign tax credits 

net income for the reasons discussed above our net income increased  from 4524 million  in 2016  to 7402 million  in 2017  an increase  of 2878 million  or 636  primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the tax act on earnings of approximately 1275 million and the gain on the disposition of nextraq of 1092 million partially offset by incremental amortization expense stock based compensation expense impairment of our investment in masternaut and legal fees during 2017 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income operating income increased  from 7542 million  in 2016  to 8838 million  in 2017  an increase  of 1296 million  or 172  consolidated operating margin was 412  in 2016  and 393  in 2017  the increase in operating income was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 organic growth as well as the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately 25 million  as previously discussed these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately 178 million additional stock based compensation of approximately 30 million  higher professional and legal fees totaling approximately 22 million and the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017 of approximately 8 million the decrease in operating margin is driven by the items discussed above 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north america segment operating income north america operating income increased  from 5064 million  in 2016  to 5416 million  in 2017  an increase  of 352 million  or 69  north america operating margin was 396  in 2016  and 379  in 2017  the increase  in operating income was due primarily to organic growth and the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately 24 million  driven primarily by higher fuel prices these increases were partially offset by additional stock based compensation of approximately 21 million higher operating expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017 of approximately 50 million higher professional and legal fees totaling approximately 22 million and the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017 of approximately 8 million the decrease in operating margin is driven by the items discussed above

consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions decreased from 1083 million in 2015 to 1043 million in 2016 a decrease of39 million or 36 this decrease was primarily due to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel which impacted merchant commissions in certain card programs as well as the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

processing processing expenses increased from 3311 million in 2015 to 3554 million in 2016 an increase of 243 million or 74 increases in processing expenses were primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and incremental bad debt expense partially offset by the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and lower negotiated vendor processing costs 

selling  selling expenses increased from 1091 million in 2015 to 1314 million in 2016 an increase of 224 million or 205 increases in spending were primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 as well as additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets partially offset by the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased from 2977 million in 2015 to 2836 million in 2016 a decrease of 141 million or 47 the decrease was primarily due to decreased stock based compensation of approximately 26 million from the comparable period in 2015 and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates partially offset by ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and an incremental 2 million in acquisition related expenses over 2015 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 1935 million in 2015 to 2033 million in 2016 an increase of 98 million or 51 the increase was primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 partially offset by movements in and adjustments from changes in foreign exchange rates of approximately 2 million 

other operating net  other operating net decreased from 42 million in 2015 to 07 million in 2016 the decrease is due to favorable reversals of various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db trans sa  db and vb in brazil in 2015 

investment loss losses at our equity method investment decreased from 577 million in 2015 to 364 million in 2016 the decrease was primarily due to a nonrecurring gain of 138 million during 2016 as well as less costs incurred to restructure the operations of the business and a smaller impairment of our investment compared to 2015 

we regularly evaluate our investments which are not carried at fair value for other than temporary impairment in accordance with u s gaap during the fourth quarter of 2016 we determined that the performance improvement initiatives planned at masternaut were more challenging to implement than we originally projected as a result we recorded a 361 million noncash impairment charge in our equity method investment in 2016 compared to a 40 million charge in 2015

lower than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates 

net income for the reasons discussed above our net income increased from 3624 million in 2015 to 4524 million in 2016 an increase of 900 million or 248 

operating income and operating margin

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north america segment operating income north america operating income increased from 4420 million  in 2015 to 5064 million in 2016 an increase of 644 million or 146 north america operating margin was 359 in 2015 and 396 in 2016 the increase in operating income was due primarily to less stock based compensation expense compared to 2015 and organic growth in the business partially offset by the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately 56 million driven by lower fuel prices and lower fuel spread margins 

international segment operating income international operating income increased from 2255 million in 2015 to 2477 million in 2016 an increase of 223 million or 99 international operating margin was 479 in 2015 and 448 in 2016 the increase in operating income was due primarily to acquisitions completed in 2016 and organic growth in the business partially offset by the approximately 26 million unfavorable impact of the macroeconomic environment specifically unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates as well as the negative impact of fuel prices internationally the impact of changes in fuel price spreads was negligible 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness make acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios repurchase shares of our common stock and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

sources of liquidity at december 31 2017  our cash balances totaled 11309 million  with approximately 2173 million  restricted restricted cash represents customer deposits in the czech republic and in our comdata business in the us as well as collateral received from customers for crosscurrency transactions in our cambridge business which are restricted from use other than to repay customer deposits as well as secure and settle crosscurrency transactions 

at december 31 2017  cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested was 5561 million all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries excluding restricted cash are available for general corporate purposes our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time we currently believe that funds generated from our us operations along with available borrowing capacity in the us will be sufficient to fund our us operations for the foreseeable future and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our us operations 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 the us enacted the tax act which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions we have provisionally recorded an 818 million charge on these undistributed earnings in 2017 as permitted by the tax act we intend to pay the onetime transition tax in eight annual interestfree installments beginning in 2018 we are currently evaluating the remaining undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided deferred taxes for foreign withholding tax as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested the amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic fuel card receivables to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants before collecting the receivable as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions at december 31 2017  we had no additional liquidity under our securitization facility at december 31 2017  we had approximately 615 million available under our credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

  



operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased from 7059 million  in 2016  to 6757 million  in 2017  operating cash flows were primarily affected by higher net income the gain on the sale of our nextraq business in 2017  treated as an investing activity and deferred income taxes resulting from enactment of the tax act also included in cash flows from operating activities were unfavorable working capital adjustments primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments in 2017  over the comparable period in 2016  

net cash provided by operating activities decreased from 7546 million  in 2015  to 7059 million  in 2016  the decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital driven by fluctuations in receivables and payables largely due to timing of month end transactions and volume cash flow was favorably impacted by additional net income of 90 million  during 2016  over the comparable period in 2015  

investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased from 14 billion  in 2016  to 4978 million  in 2017  this decrease was primarily due to reduction in cash outlay for acquisitions and the proceeds received from the sale of our nextraq business during the third quarter of 2017 

net cash used in investing activities increased from 994 million  in 2015  to 13896 million  in 2016  this increase was primarily due to the increase in cash paid for our stp and travelcard acquisitions completed in 2016  

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased from 7540 million  in 2016  to 2519 million  in 2017  the decrease is primarily due to additional repayments on our credit facility of 5998 million  in 2017  over 2016  and increased spending to repurchase our common stock of 2147 million  partially offset by an increase in borrowings of 243 million  on our securitization facility and an increase in borrowings of 555 million  on our credit facility 

net cash from financing activities increased from net cash used of 6481 million  in 2015  to net cash provided of 7540 million  in 2016  the increase was primarily due to an increase in net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term loans of 9522 million  and 5850 million  respectively to fund acquisitions during 2016

stock repurchase program 

on february 4 2016  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program the program under which we may purchase up to an aggregate of 500 million  of our common stock over the following 18 months  period on july 27 2017  our board of directors authorized an increase in the size of the program by an additional 250 million  and an extension of the program by an additional 18 months  on november 1 2017  we announced that our board of directors had authorized an additional increase in the size of the program by an another 350 million  resulting in total aggregate repurchases authorized under the program of 11 billion  with the increase and giving effect to 5901 million  of previous repurchases we may repurchase up to 510 million  in shares of our common stock at any time prior to february 1 2019 

any stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as deemed appropriate the timing and amount of stock repurchases if any will depend on a variety of factors including the stock price market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements and any additional constraints related to material inside information we may possess any repurchases have been and are expected to be funded by a combination of available cash flow from the business working capital and debt 

on august 3 2017 as part of the program we entered an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr agreement with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 250 million  of our common stock pursuant to the asr agreement we delivered 250 million  in cash and received 1491647  shares based on a stock price of 14246  on august 7 2017 the asr agreement was completed on september 7 2017 at which time the we received 263012  additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of 14248  

we accounted for the asr agreement as two  separate transactions i as shares of reacquired common stock for the shares delivered to us upon effectiveness of the asr agreement and ii as a forward contract indexed to our common stock for the undelivered shares the initial delivery of shares was included in treasury stock at cost and results in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share the forward contracts indexed to our own common stock met the criteria for equity classification and these amounts were initially recorded in additional paidin capital and then reclassified to treasury stock upon completion of the asr agreement 

since the beginning of the program 4114104  shares for an aggregate purchase price of 5901 million  have been repurchased there were 2854959  common shares totaling 4024 million  repurchased under the program during 2017  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition and presentation revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as from customers and partners we recognize revenue on fees generated through services primarily to commercial fleets commercial businesses major oil companies petroleum marketers and leasing companies and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following i we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the acceptability of the product ii we have no inventory risk do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the product or have any involvement in the product specifications iii we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for the product and iv the amount we earn for our services is fixed within a limited range we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships processing and other arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the services have been provided to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as more fully described below 

through our merchant and network relationships we provide fuel prepaid cards vehicle maintenance lodging food toll and transportation related services to our customers we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction our revenue consists of margin on sales and fees for technical support processing communications and reporting the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of the product plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as expense when the fuel purchase transaction is executed we have entered into agreements with major oil companies petroleum marketers and leasing companies among others that specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records 

we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees service fees report fees and other transactionbased fees which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed number of transactions processed or some combination thereof such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of thirdparty networks transaction fees and other transactionbased fees generated from our proprietary networks and thirdparty networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured card fees network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations in addition we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations primarily in the us and canada such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed the company ceases billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 3040 days after the customer’s balance becomes delinquent 

we also charge our customers transaction fees to load value onto prepaid fuel food toll and transportation vouchers and cards we recognize fee revenue upon providing the activated fuel food toll and transportation vouchers and prepaid cards to the customer revenue is recognized on lodging and transportation management services when the lodging stay or transportation service is provided revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment and cards in certain of our businesses which is recognized at the time the device is sold and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues net within the consolidated statements of income the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within processing expenses in the consolidated statements of income we have recorded 968 million  of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income in 2017 sales commissions paid to personnel are expensed as incurred 

we deliver both stored value cards and cardbased services primarily in the form of gift cards for multipledeliverable customer contracts stored value cards and cardbased services are separated into two units of accounting stored valued cards are generally recognized upon shipment to the customer cardbased services are recognized when the card services are rendered 

we present taxes assessed by the government imposed concurrent with a revenue producing transaction between us and our customers eg vat on a net basis within revenues net 

our fiscal year ends on december 31 in certain of our uk businesses we record the operating results using a 445 week accounting cycle with the fiscal year ending on the friday on or immediately preceding december 31 

a ccounts receivable as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is 950 million accounts receivable collateralized within our securitization facility relate to trade receivables resulting from charge card activity in the us pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a revolving basis to fleetcor funding llc funding a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary in turn funding sells without recourse on a revolving basis up to 950 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit conduit funding maintains a subordinated interest in the form of over collateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper 

we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of financing to reduce our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit 

enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable subject to a maximum amount 

the company’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income reflect the activity related to securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt including interest income fees generated from late payments provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense the cash flows from borrowings and repayments associated with the securitized debt are presented as cash flows from financing activities 

foreign receivables are not included in our receivable securitization program at december 31 2017  and 2016  there was 811 million  and 591 million  respectively of shortterm debt outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility 

credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers payments from customers are generally due within 14 days or less of billing we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible once they age past 90 days and are deemed uncollectible from the customer we also provide an allowance for receivables aged less than 90 days that we expect will be uncollectible based on historical collections experience including accounts that have filed for bankruptcy at december 31 2017  approximately 96  of outstanding accounts receivable were current accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency recoveries from the thirdparty collection agency are not significant 

impairment of longlived assets intangibles and investments we test our longlived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance we evaluate if impairment indicators related to our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or asset group the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with management’s intended actions if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows we determine the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally we perform our testing of the asset group at the businessline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

we complete an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and the impairment test consists of two steps as well as a qualitative assessment as appropriate we have performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the 

carrying value of net assets likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step 1 test from the prior year updated with current year results weightedaverage cost of capital rates and future projections 

in step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangibles as 

if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss 

we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discounted the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate 

preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions significant changes in forecasts the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 

based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively on october 1 2017  we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

we also regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investments which are not carried at fair value for otherthantemporary impairment we estimate the fair value of our investments using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of our investments in developing the valuation estimate 

on september 30 2017 we entered into an amended masternaut group holdings limited masternaut investment agreement that resulted in the loss of significant influence and we began accounting for the masternaut investment by applying the cost method we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investment and during the third quarter of 2017 we determined that the fair value of our 44  investment in masternaut had declined as a result of our loss of significant influence as a result we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value and concluded that this decline in value was other than temporary we recorded a 446 million  impairment loss in the masternaut investment that includes adjustment for 314 million  of currency losses previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in the year ended december 31 2017 in the accompanying consolidated statements of income during the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015 we determined that the performance improvement initiatives in our investment in masternaut were taking longer to and were more challenging to implement than originally projected based on revised cash flow projections provided by the business as a result we recorded a 361 million  and 40 million  noncash impairment charge in its masternaut investment for 2016  and 2015 respectively 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or 

settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

current accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 the us government enacted tax legislation referred to as the tax act as a result of tax act the us federal corporate tax rate was reduced from 35 to 21 the tax act also includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions we have provisionally recorded a 210 million  deferred tax benefit for the benefit for the corporate rate reduction on our deferred tax assets and liabilities additionally in 2017 we have provisionally recorded an 818 million  charge on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions we are currently evaluating the remaining undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided deferred taxes for foreign withholding tax as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested the amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the us or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required see note 11 for further information regarding income taxes 

business combinations business combinations completed by us have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income for significant acquisitions we obtain independent thirdparty valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist us in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the results of th e acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction 

estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provisional estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the final amounts recorded the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and is remeasured each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income we estimate the fair value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration using various valuation approaches as well as significant unobservable inputs reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 

stockbased compensation we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to five years and vesting of the options is generally based on the passage of time or performance stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options option forfeitures are accounted for upon occurrence we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the 

value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions or a combination of these shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one to three years the fair value of restricted stock where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock 

for performancebased restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

derivatives with our acquisition of cambridge in august 2017 we use derivatives to facilitate crosscurrency corporate payments by writing derivatives to customers which are not designated as hedging instruments the majority of cambridges revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments in addition cambridge also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for its customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year we aggregate our foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including forwards options and spot exchanges of currency and hedges economic hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties the changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in revenues net in the consolidated statements of income 

we recognize all derivatives in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their fair value all cash flows associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed the company’s management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

tax act the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act 

revenue recognition   in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 the core principle of asu 201409 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap and permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method the update requires significant additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments asu 201409 as amended by asu 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date is effective for years beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods with early adoption permitted for years beginning after december 15 2016 since the issuance of asu 201409 the fasb has issued additional interpretive guidance including new accounting standards updates that clarifies certain points of the standard and modifies certain requirements 

we have performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and we are monitoring the activity of the fasb and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance we have established an implementation team to assess the effects of the new revenue standard in a multiphase approach in the first phase we analyzed customer contracts for our most significant contract categories applied the fivestep model of topic 606 to each contract category and comparing the 

results to our current accounting practices the second phase which includes quantifying the potential effects identified during the first phase assessing additional contract categories and principal versus agent considerations revising accounting policies and considering the effects on related disclosures andor internal control over financial reporting is ongoing and expected to be concluded during the first quarter of 2018 

topic 606 could change the amount and timing of revenue and expenses to be recognized under certain of our arrangement types in addition it could also increase the administrative burden on our operations to account for customer contracts and provide the more expansive required disclosures more judgment and estimates may be required within the process of applying the requirements of the new standard than are required under existing gaap such as identifying performance obligations in contracts estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in transaction price allocating transaction price to each separate performance obligation and estimating expected customer lives we are in the process of finalizing our assessment and completing the quantification of the effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements related disclosures andor internal control over financial reporting this conclusion will be made over the remainder of the first quarter of 2018 and will include finalizing our evaluation of the application of the principal vs agent guidance specifically as it relates to products where we utilize a thirdparty payment network and in certain businesses where we pay merchant commissions however our preliminary view is that the expected amount and timing of revenue to be recognized under topic 606 for our most significant contract categories fuel card payments lodging payments toll payments corporate payments and gift cards will be similar to the amount and timing of revenue recognized under our current accounting practices except as it relates to the presentation of certain costs where we may be determined to be an agent in the processing relationship under the new guidance resulting in recording such costs as a reduction of revenue we will be required to capitalize additional costs to obtain contracts with customers and in some cases may be required to amortize these costs over a contractual time period finally we expect disclosures about our revenues and related customer acquisition costs to be more extensive 

  

we plan to adopt topic 606 as well as other clarifications and technical guidance issued by the fasb related to this new revenue standard effective january 1 2018 we will apply the modified retrospective transition method which would result in an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect if any of applying the standard to contracts that are not completed at the date of initial application under this method we would not restate the prior financial statements presented therefore the new standard requires us to provide additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period during 2018 as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes if any 

accounting for leases in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which requires lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases this asu also requires disclosures to provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements this asu is effective for us for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods therein early adoption is permitted the new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and requires application of the new guidance for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 201602 on our consolidated financial statements however we expect to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for operating leases in the consolidated balance sheet upon adoption 

accounting for breakage   in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201604 “liabilitiesextinguishments of liabilities recognition of breakage for certain prepaid storedvalue products” which requires entities that sell prepaid stored value products redeemable for goods services or cash at thirdparty merchants to derecognize liabilities related to those products for breakage this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted the asu must be adopted using either a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption or a full retrospective approach our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

cash flow classification in august 2016 the fasb issued asu 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments which amends the guidance in asc 230 statement of cash flows this amended guidance reduces the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows this asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticableour adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash which amends the guidance in asc 230 statement of cash flows on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows this asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period the amendments in this asu should be applied using a retrospective transition method to 

each period presented we do not believe the adoption of this asu will impact the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

intangibles  goodwill and other impairment in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill ie step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to measure a goodwill impairment charge instead entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value ie measure the charge based on step 1 the standard has tiered effective dates starting in 2020 for calendaryear public business entities that meet the definition of an sec filer early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment testing dates after january 1 2017 our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows unless a goodwill impairment is identified 

definition of a business in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201701 clarifying the definition of a business which amends the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business the guidance requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets if so the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business the guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs the guidance is effective for the reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows however it could result in accounting for acquisitions as asset acquisitions versus business combinations upon adoption 

accounting for modifications to stockbased compensation   in may 2017 the fasb issued asu 201709 compensation—stock compensation topic 718 scope of modification accounting which amends the scope of modification accounting for sharebased payment arrangements the asu provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of sharebased payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under asc 718 specifically an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value vesting conditions and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

accounting for derivative financial instruments  in august 2017 the fasb issued asu 201712 derivatives and hedging topic 815 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements in asc 815 the fasb issued accounting guidance to better align hedge accounting with a company’s risk management activities simplify the application of hedge accounting and improve the disclosures of hedging arrangements the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those years early adoption is permitted our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows

management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

adjusted revenues we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted revenues as revenues net less merchant commissions as reflected in our income statement 

we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in millions   



pro forma and macro adjusted revenues we have defined the nongaap measure pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as revenues net adjusted for the impact of the macroeconomic environment acquisitions and dispositions and other onetime items we use pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as a basis to evaluate our organic growth 

set forth below is a reconciliation of pro forma and macro adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in millions 

  





 columns may not calculate due to rounding 

1  adjusted to remove the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment to be consistent with the same period of prior year using constant fuel prices fuel price spreads and foreign exchange rates as well as onetime items 

2  pro forma to include acquisitions and exclude dispositions and onetime items consistent with previous period ownership 

3  2016 reflects immaterial corrections in estimated allocation of revenue by product from previously disclosed amounts 

4  adjustments related to onetime items not representative of normal business operations 

5  other includes telematics maintenance food and transportation related businesses 

adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stockbased compensation expense related to sharebased compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs discounts and intangible assets amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment c a nonrecurring net gain at equity method investment d impairment of our equity method investment e net gain on disposition of business f loss on extinguishment of debt and g other nonrecurring items including the impact of the tax act 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

  






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

foreign earnings 

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 365  302  and 277  of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2017  were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2017  by approximately 342 million  had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2016  and 2015  were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  by approximately 248 million  and 225 million  respectively 

unhedged crosscurrency risk 

with the acquisition of cambridge in august 2017 we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our international payments provider business the majority of cambridges revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates which enable customers to make crosscurrency payments in addition cambridge also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for customers to facilitate future payments the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year cambridge aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts including the derivative contracts described above and hedges economic hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt we invest our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes under our 4325 billion credit agreement the credit agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a revolving a credit facility in the amount of 1285 billion  a term loan a facility in the amount of 2690 billion  and a term loan b facility in the amount of 3500 million  as of december 31 2017  the revolving credit facility consists of a a revolving a credit facility in the amount of 8000 million with sublimits for letters of credit and swing line loans b a revolving b facility in the amount of 4500 million  for swing line loans and multicurrency borrowings and c a revolving c facility in the amount of 350 million for multicurrency borrowings in australian dollars or new zealand dollars 

on january 20 2017  we entered into the second amendment to the credit agreement which established a new term b loan interest on the term b loan facility accrues based on the eurocurrency rate or the base rate at 225  for eurocurrency loans and at 125  for base rate loans interest on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement other than the term b loan accrues based on the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050  b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100  plus a margin based on a leverage ratio in addition the company pays a quarterly commitment fee at a rate per annum ranging from 020  to 040  of the daily unused portion of the credit facility 

based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense   would have changed by approximately 347 million 279 million and 262 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2017  management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2017  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  as of december 31 2017  management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

in connection with managements evaluation our management team excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 the internal controls related to three subsidiaries that we acquired during the year ended december 31 2017 and for which financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements 

on august 9 2017 we acquired cambridge global payments “cambridge” a leading business to business b2b international payments provider in canada on september 26 2017 we acquired a fuel card provider in russia on october 13 2017 we completed the acquisition of creative lodging solutions cls a lodging business in the united states collectively we refer to these transactions as the acquisitions these acquisitions constituted 11 of total assets at december 31 2017 and 3 of revenues for the year then ended this exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in managements report on internal control over financial reporting the year of acquisition 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2017  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

regulatory 

a substantial number of laws and regulations both in the united states and in other jurisdictions apply to businesses offering payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts these laws and regulations are often evolving and sometimes ambiguous or inconsistent and the extent to which they apply to us is at times unclear failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services andor the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including fines certain of our services are also subject to rules set by various payment networks such as mastercard as more fully described below 

the following while not exhaustive is a description of several federal and state laws and regulations in the united states that are applicable to our business the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions also affect us and they may be more or less restrictive than those in the united states and may also impact different parts of our operations in addition the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing revision and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us

truth in lending act 

the truth in lending act or tila was enacted to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and is implemented by regulation z most provisions of tila and regulation z apply only to the extension of consumer credit but a limited number apply to commercial cards as well one example where tila and regulation z are generally applicable is a limitation on liability for unauthorized use although a business that acquires 10 or more credit cards for its personnel can agree to more expansive liability our cardholder agreements generally provide for these business customers to waive to the fullest extent possible all limitations on liability for unauthorized card use 

credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 

the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 amended provisions of tila that affect consumer credit and also directed the federal reserve board to study the use of credit cards by small businesses and to make legislative recommendations the report concluded that it is not clear whether the potential benefits outweigh the increased cost and reduced credit availability if the disclosure and substantive restrictions applicable to consumer cards were to be applied to small business cards legislation has been introduced from time to time to increase the protections afforded to small businesses that use payment cards if legislation of this kind were enacted our products and services for small businesses could be adversely impacted 

equal credit opportunity act 

the equal credit opportunity act or ecoa together with regulation b prohibit creditors from discriminating on certain prohibited bases such as an applicant’s sex race nationality age and marital status and further requires that creditors disclose the reasons for taking any adverse action against an applicant or a customer seeking credit

through certain subsidiaries we are registered money services businesses as a result we have established antimoney laundering compliance programs that include i internal policies and controls ii designation of a compliance officer iii ongoing employee training and iv an independent review function we have developed and implemented compliance programs comprised of policies procedures systems and internal controls to monitor and address various legal requirements and developments 

in addition provisions of the bsa known as the prepaid access rule issued by the financial crimes enforcement network of the us department of the treasury fincen impose certain obligations such as registration and collection of consumer information on “providers” of certain prepaid access programs including the stored value products issued by our sponsor banks for which we serve as program manager fincen has taken the position that where the issuing bank has principal oversight and control of such prepaid access programs no other participant in the distribution chain would be required to register as a provider under the prepaid access rule despite this position we have opted to register as a provider of prepaid access through our subsidiary comdata inc we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control or ofac that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the cfpb which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit in addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb is authorized to issue rules prohibiting udaap by persons offering consumer financial products or services and their service providers and has authority to enforce these consumer financial protection laws and cfpb rules the cfpb has not defined what is a consumer financial product or service but has indicated informally that in some instances small businesses may be covered under consumer protection 

as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs 

in addition the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the federal reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing clearing and settling the transaction payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions in july 2011 the federal reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees effective in october 2011 with certain exemptions debit interchange rates are capped at 021 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus for qualifying issuing financial institutions an additional 001 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations because we qualify for an exemption for the majority of our debit transactions 

the implementation of the doddfrank act is ongoing and as a result its overall impact remains unclear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that it is possible that we could be further directly or indirectly impacted

state usury laws 

extensions of credit under many of our card products may be treated as commercial loans in some states usury laws limit the interest rates that can be charged not only on consumer loans but on commercial loans as well to the extent that these usury laws apply we are limited in the amount of interest that we can charge and collect from our customers because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions we utilize choice of law provisions in our cardholder agreements as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply in addition the interest rates on certain of our card products are set based upon the usury limit of the cardholder’s state with respect to card products where we work with a partner or issuing bank the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and “exports” the usury limit of that state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2016  approximately 13 our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

  

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 11  of our consolidated revenue in 2016  was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not credit worthy or are fraudulently completed changes in our industry customer demand and in relation to our fleet customers movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result could lead to increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition our bad debt expense was 359 million in 2016 compared to 246 million in 2015 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments we derived approximately 76 of our consolidated revenues from these fees and charges during the year ended december 31 2016  revenues for late fees and finance charges represent 6 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity or the extent to which they use optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer in the fleet card business our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers in the commercial payments business we face a variety of competitors some of which have greater financial resources name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies among others competitors in the mobile telematics business include the major car companies wireless phone service providers and independent services companies among others we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of food fuel toll transportation and fleet cards and vouchers commercial fleet cards offered by the major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers such as treasury management commercial lending and credit card processing by providing these other services that we do not provide these competitors have an advantage of being able to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships sometimes at a discount for example in the commercial payments business we compete with full service banks that are able to offer treasury management and commercial lending in addition to commercial payment solutions if price competition continues to intensify we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers decrease the prices of our products and services or lose customers each of which could adversely affect our operating results in the fleet card business major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as well as offer add on complementary services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard 

products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies and to establish additional relationships with other petroleum marketers we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” we use this term in the business sense to refer to strategic business relationships formed through contracts such as card program agreements and not in the legal sense of operating under legal partnership arrangements created pursuant to laws such as the uniform partnership act during 2016  our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for less than 7 of our consolidated revenue our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from about one to six years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected also our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win this business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

during 2016 we received notice from an oil partner that they did not intend to renew our current contract when it expires at the end of 2017 additionally in 2016 we signed an agreement to manage the commercial fuel card program for a new strategic partner we do not expect either of these contracts to have a material impact on our business and operating results 

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base in the closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel maintenance services and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected 

with respect to the closedloop networks we utilize a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers as well as from our new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants and service garages typically have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew on the same basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships failure to continue such relationships on similarly attractive economic terms the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

we depend on our relationships with major truck stop merchants to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers we must maintain these relationships to effectively serve our customers that use these merchants if we are unable to maintain these relationships our overtheroad card businesses may be adversely affected 

we have long standing relationships with major truck stop merchants to accept our overtheroad fuel cards overtheroad customers purchase a significant proportion of their fuel at major truck stop merchants the loss of existing major truck stop merchant relationships or failure to continue such relationships on similar terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other business related products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the united states and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the united states europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other business related products and services by our customers the commercial payments industry in general and our commercial payment solutions business specifically depends heavily upon the overall level of spending unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession political climate or other changes may lead our corporate customers to reduce their spending resulting in reduced demand for or use of our products and services in addition unfavorable changes in economic conditions may lead our fleet card customers to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services as a result a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states or abroad could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase a weakening economy could also force some retailers and merchants to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and transaction declines in addition demand for fuel and other business related products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration of the ongoing sluggish economic conditions in the united states europe russia latin america australia and new zealand as a result continued weakness in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example we have entered into the corporate payments stored value card vehicle maintenance management and telematics business in the united states and europe and transaction processing fuel food toll and transportation card and voucher businesses in brazil and mexico we may continue to enter new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis 

the products we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions all at high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any 

performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we may rely on third parties to develop or codevelop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms or at all and these relationships may not be successful in addition partners some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties even if we are successful in developing new services and technologies these new services and technologies may not achieve broad acceptance due to a variety of factors including a lack of industrywide standards competing products and services or resistance to these changes from our customers in addition we may not be able to derive revenue from these efforts 

if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2016  we had approximately 385 billion  of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew every three years 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain 

purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a three year term although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually in the past there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us for example the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility during the financial crisis that began in 2008 also a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2016  approximately 30  of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound brazilian real russian ruble mexican peso czech koruna euro australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer in the united states and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

  



 in addition the integration process following an acquisition requires significant management attention and resources integration of acquisitions could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies on our services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the united states 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in australia austria azerbaijan belarus belgium brazil bulgaria canada croatia the czech republic denmark estonia finland france georgia germany greece hong kong hungary ireland italy kazakhstan latvia lithuania luxembourg macau malaysia mexico moldova mongolia morocco the netherlands new zealand norway papua new guinea philippines poland portugal romania russia singapore slovakia slovenia south africa spain sweden switzerland turkey united arab emirates the united kingdom and ukraine we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate such as russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the united states for example russia and the ukraine are experiencing significant unrest which could escalate into broader armed conflict and additional economic sanctions by the us united nations or other countries against russia in addition political discourse in the united states may impact business practices in mexico and other jurisdictions in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet revenues from nonus operations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the united states these include 

  



 in addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as brexit this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the european union and this uncertainty may persist for years a withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdoms withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products including our products any of these effects among others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the united states we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems telecommunications data centers and call centers including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to provide reliable service to customers cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data centers and call centers as well as third party labor and services providers our business involves processing large numbers of transactions the movement of large sums of money and management of large amounts of data we rely on the ability of our employees contractors suppliers systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure uninterrupted and errorfree manner 

our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors such as power availability telecommunications carrier redundancy embargoes and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries 

we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data however there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown security breach or catastrophic event such as fire explosion flood pandemic natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure or physical breakin we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but in any event these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our products and services are based on proprietary and thirdparty network technology and processing systems that may encounter development delays and could be susceptible to undetected errors viruses or defects development delays system errors viruses or defects that result in service interruption or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation and subject us to thirdparty liability in addition errors viruses and defects in our network technology and processing systems could result in additional development costs and the diversion of our technical and other resources from other development efforts or operations further our attempts to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our agreements may not be successful 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers we do not maintain insurance to protect us against such losses we bear similar risk relating to fraudulent acts of employees or contractors for which we maintain insurance however the conditions or limits of coverage may be insufficient to protect us against such losses 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft a single significant incident of fraud or increases in the overall level of fraud involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions including significant monetary fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect the data we collect which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information social security numbers expense data and credit card debit card and checking account numbers we endeavor to keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition under payment network rules regulatory requirements and related obligations we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties such as third party service providers vendors partners and others which we refer to collectively as associated participants the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the market for our commercial payment fleet and stored value card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers if businesses do not continue to use or increase their use of credit debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe that future 

growth in the use of credit debit and stored value cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of services offered in order for us to consistently increase and maintain profitability businesses must continue to use and increase the use of electronic payment methods including credit debit and stored value cards moreover if there is an adverse development in the payments industry in general such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business or a wellpublicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally 

furthermore new technologies may displace credit debit andor stored value cards as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses a decline in the acceptance and use of credit debit andor stored value cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards food vouchers and cards transportation and toll road payments telematics solutions and fleet maintenance management services is also evolving and those portions of our business are subject to similar risks 

if we fail to retain any of our stored value gift card customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all which will reduce our revenue 

most of our stored value gift card customers in the united states are national retailers during 2016  a majority of our gift card revenue was derived from the design and purchase of gift card inventory with the remaining portion of our 2016  gift card revenue derived primarily from processing fees if we fail to retain any of these customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all because there is a limited number of national retailers in the united states and nearly all of those other national retailers already have a gift card solution in place either inhouse or with one of our competitors as such any loss of a stored value gift card customer would reduce our revenue 

adverse weather conditions across a geographic region can cause a decline in the number and amount of payment transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

when travel is severely curtailed across a geographic region during adverse weather conditions the number and amount of transactions we process can be significantly diminished particularly in our fleet business and revenue can materially decline for example during parts of january 2014 severe winter weather shut down a large portion of the eastern united states prolonged adverse weather events especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fuel card workforce payment solutions and gift card businesses’ results are subject to seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income 

our fuel card and workforce payment solutions businesses have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and profit which are impacted during the first and fourth quarter each year by the weather holidays in the us christmas being celebrated in russia in january and lower business levels in brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration our gift card business has experienced in the past and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns historically gift card business revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season  

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 71  of our total assets at december 31 2016  these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been 

impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we may agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

finally we use open source software in connection with our technology and services companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software open source software is also provided without warranty and may therefore include bugs security vulnerabilities or other defects some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software andor make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost while we monitor the 

use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related technology or service such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the united states and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

for example certain of our subsidiaries are currently licensed as money transmitters on the state level by the banking departments or other state agencies continued licensing by these states is subject to periodic examinations and ongoing satisfaction of compliance requirements regarding safety and soundness including maintenance of certain levels of net worth surety bonding permissible investments in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding payment obligations with respect to certain of our products subject to licensure and record keeping and reporting if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain maintain or renew necessary licenses or comply with other relevant state regulations they will not be able to operate as a money transmitter in those states or provide certain other services and products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the financial crimes enforcement network or fincen and must comply with applicable antimoney laundering requirements including implementation of an effective antimoney laundering program changes in this regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business 

regulatory changes may also restrict or eliminate present and future business opportunities available to certain of our subsidiaries for example the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act which serves to limit interchange fees may restrict or otherwise impact the way our subsidiaries do business or limit their ability to charge certain fees to customers the cfpb is also engaged in rule making and regulation of the payments industry in particular with respect to prepaid cards and on october 5 2016 the cfpb issued a final rule amending regulations e and z to create comprehensive consumer protections for prepaid financial products the extensive nature of these regulations and the implementation dates for this additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business the cfpb’s focus on the protection of consumers might also extend to many of our small business customers as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changing regulations or standards in the area of privacy and data protection could also adversely impact us in addition certain of our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authority and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

our business is subject to us federal antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 which we refer to collectively as the bsa our business in canada is also subject to proceeds of crime money laundering and terrorist financing act or the pctfa which is a corollary to the bsa the 

bsa among other things requires money services businesses such as money transmitters issuers of money orders and official checks and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records the pctfa imposes similar requirements 

many of these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly with increasing frequency federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training monitoring and compliance including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and appropriate manner we may be subject to injunctions other sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties and our reputation may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

in addition recently implemented and pending changes in accounting standards for example changes relating to revenue recognition for customer contracts that will become effective for fiscal 2018 may adversely affect our results of operations 

finally we have endeavored to structure our businesses in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions payroll taxes and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws their interpretations or their enforcement could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services 

governmental bodies in the united states and abroad have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations restricting the transfer of and requiring safeguarding of nonpublic personal information for example in the united states all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to help protect the privacy and security of consumer financial information in connection with providing services to our clients we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks our sponsor bank and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer information these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as payment card industry or pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer personal information received from our customers our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level our compliance costs may increase our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our acquisition documents include warranties covenants and conditions regarding various tax matters that occurred prior to the acquisition supported by indemnification and in some cases holdbacks or escrows from the sellers the obligations of the sellers are also generally subject to various limitations in the event of a tax claim related to a preacquisition tax year we would seek to recover costs and losses from the sellers under the acquisition agreement however there is no assurance that any indemnification holdback or escrow would be sufficient or that we would recover such costs or losses which could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in increased expenses 

we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our current and past operations including employmentrelated disputes contract disputes intellectual property disputes government audits and proceedings customer disputes and tort claims responding to such claims may be difficult and expensive and we may not prevail in some proceedings the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief which if granted would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings regardless of whether we prevail or not such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have had inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business such inquiries may result in various audits reviews and investigations which can be time consuming and expensive an adverse outcome of any investigation by or other inquiries from such bodies or agencies could have a material adverse effect on us and result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties changes in personnel and increased review and scrutiny by customers regulatory authorities the media and others which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information about our judicial and other proceedings see “business—legal proceedings” 

our revenues from mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of mastercard it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations through our financial institution sponsors 

a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the united states and canada registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or 

determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive even if we pursue sponsorship by alternative member banks similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist   in addition mastercard routinely updates and modifies its requirements changes in the requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services if we do not comply with mastercard requirements it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registration which allows us to process transactions on its networks the termination of our registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers which would have a material adverse effect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network card transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and the uk bribery act the fcpa prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

  



 in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions   

 in addition delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock and us these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 

we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

we currently expect to retain all future earnings if any for future operation expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any decision to declare and pay 

dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our operating results financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in addition we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur

executive overview 

we operate in two segments which we refer to as our north america and international segments see “results of operations” for additional segment information 

our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue” for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  our north america and international segments generated the following revenue 

  



revenues net net income and net income per diluted share  set forth below are revenues net net income and net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

                          

sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions as illustrated in the diagram below a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners for whom we manage card programs members of our proprietary networks who are provided access to our products and services and commercial businesses to whom we provide workforce payment productivity solutions revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as our customers and partners through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel cards corporate cards virtual cards purchasing cards te cards gift cards stored value payroll cards vehicle maintenance food fuel toll and transportation cards and vouchers or lodging services to our customers 

the following diagram illustrates a typical card transaction flow but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance lodging and food fuel toll and transportation card and voucher products substituting transactions for gallons this representative model is not applicable to all of our businesses 

illustrative transaction flow 

from our customers and partners we derive revenue from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and charges which can be fixed fees cost plus a markup or based on a percentage discount from retail prices our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue mostly from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses as illustrated in the table below the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of the product plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit 

the following table presents an illustrative revenue model for transactions with the merchant which is primarily applicable to fuel based product transactions but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance lodging and food fuel toll and transportation card and voucher products substituting transactions for gallons this representative model may not include all of our businesses

revenue per transaction  set forth below is revenue per transaction information for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

  

3 adjusted revenues is a nongaap financial measure defined as revenues net less merchant commissions we believe this measure is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs adjusted revenues is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of operating performance see the heading entitled managements use of nongaap financial measures 

from 2015 to 2016 total transactions increased from 19 billion  to 22 billion  an increase of 3751 million  or 203  north american segment transactions increased approximately 3  in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to growth in our pacpride mastercard and corporate payments businesses transaction volumes in our international segment increased by approximately 176  over 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of stp and travelcard during the third quarter of 2016 the addition of new shell fuel card markets in 2015 and 2016 and additional transactions from a small acquisition in brazil in the first quarter of 2016 

from 2014 to 2015 total transactions increased from 6524 million  to 19 billion  an increase of 12 billion  or 1838  we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america segment primarily due to our acquisition of comdata in november 2014 of which 13 billion  and 270 million  transactions are attributable to svs for 2015 and 2014 respectively as well as from organic growth in our us businesses transaction volumes in our international segment decreased slightly by 45  primarily due to market softness in some of our international businesses 

set forth below is further breakdown of revenue per transaction by product information for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  in millions except per transaction data 



4 other includes telematics maintenance and transportation benefits related businesses 

revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and the overall macroeconomic environment including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases as macroeconomic factors change and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates see “results of operations” for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction 

sources of expenses 

we incur expenses in the following categories 

  



 adjusted revenues adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share  set forth below are adjusted revenues adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014    



we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate thus we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental nongaap financial measures of operating performance see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures” 

factors and trends impacting our business 

we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance 

  

 acquisitions and investments 

during 2016 we completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of 13 billion  net of cash acquired of 513 million  which includes deferred payments made during the period related to prior acquisitions of 61 million  

  



 the results of operations from the fuel card portfolio acquired in the us are included within our north america segment from the date of acquisition the results of operations of stp the fuel card portfolio in the united kingdom the additional shell markets the travelcard business in the netherlands and the small business in brazil are included within our international segment from the date of acquisition 

during 2015 we completed acquisitions of shell portfolios related to our fuel card businesses in europe as well as a small acquisition internationally with an aggregate purchase price of 463 million  each included within our international segment from the date of acquisition and made additional investments of 84 million  related to our equity method investment at masternaut and deferred payments of 34 million  related to acquisitions occurring in prior years 

during 2014  we completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of 367 billion  net of cash acquired of 1658 million  

  

 the results of operations of the shell germany business are included within our international segment from the date of acquisition the results of operations from pacpride and comdata are included within our north america segment from the date of acquisition 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015   

the following table sets forth selected consolidated statement of income and selected operational data for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  in millions except percentages 

  

revenues and revenue per transaction 

our consolidated revenue increased from 17029 million  in 2015  to 18315 million  in 2016  an increase of 1287 million  or 76  the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to 

  



consolidated revenue per transaction decreased from 092  in 2015  to 082  in 2016  a decrease of 010  or 106  this decrease was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the macroeconomic environment the mix impact of acquisitions stp travelcard and a small acquisition in brazil which have a much lower revenue per transaction than the historical average partially offset by organic growth excluding these items revenue per transaction increased approximately 5 to 097 in 2016  compared to 092 in 2015  

revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography the relevant merchant and customer relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the revenue mix was influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment including fuel prices fuel spread margins and foreign exchange rates 

north america segment revenues and revenue per transaction 

north america revenues increased from 12320 million  in 2015  to 12791 million  in 2016  an increase of 471 million  or 38  the increase in our north america segment revenue was primarily due to

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 

revenue recognition and presentation 

revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as from customers and partners we recognize revenue on fees generated through services primarily to commercial fleets commercial businesses major oil companies petroleum marketers and leasing companies and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following i we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the 

acceptability of the product ii we have no inventory risk do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the product or have any involvement in the product specifications iii we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for the product predominantly fuel and iv the amount we earn for our services is fixed within a limited range we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships processing and other arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the services have been provided to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured as more fully described below 

through our merchant and network relationships we provide fuel prepaid cards vehicle maintenance lodging food toll and transportation related services to our customers we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction our revenue consists of margin on sales and fees for technical support processing communications and reporting the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of the product plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as expense when the fuel purchase transaction is executed we have entered into agreements with major oil companies petroleum marketers and leasing companies among others that specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records 

we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees report fees and other transactionbased fees which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed number of transactions processed or some combination thereof such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of thirdparty networks transaction fees and other transactionbased fees generated from our proprietary networks and thirdparty networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured card fees network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations in addition we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations primarily in the us and canada such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed and services are provided the company ceases billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 3040 days after the customer’s balance becomes delinquent 

we also charge our customers transaction fees to load value onto prepaid fuel food toll and transportation vouchers and cards we recognize fee revenue upon providing the activated fuel food toll and transportation vouchers and prepaid cards to the customer revenue is recognized on lodging and transportation management services when the lodging stay or transportation service is completed revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment in certain of our businesses which is recognized at the time the device is sold and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues net within the consolidated statements of income the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within processing expenses we have recorded 916 million  of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income in 2016 

our fiscal year ends on december 31 in certain of our uk businesses we record the operating results using a 445 week accounting cycle with the fiscal year ending on the friday on or immediately preceding december 31 fiscal years 2015 and 2014 include 52 weeks for the businesses reporting using a 445 accounting cycle 

we deliver both stored value cards and cardbased services primarily in the form of gift cards for multipledeliverable customer contracts stored value cards and cardbased services are separated into two units of accounting stored valued cards are generally recognized upon shipment to the customer cardbased services are recognized when the card services are rendered 

a ccounts receivable 

as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is 950 million accounts receivable collateralized within our securitization facility relate to trade receivables resulting from charge card activity pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a revolving basis to fleetcor funding llc funding a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary conduit in turn funding sells without recourse on a revolving basis up to 950 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit funding maintains a subordinated interest in the form of over collateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper 

we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of financing effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable subject to a maximum amount 

on november 14 2014 in order to finance a portion of the comdata acquisition the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new receivables purchase agreement under the terms of the new receivables purchase agreement the purchase limit was increased from 500 million to 12 billion and the term of the facility was extended to november 14 2017 on november 5 2015 the first amendment to the fifth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement was entered into which allowed the company to enter into a new contract with bp and modified the eligible receivables definition and on december 1 2015 the second amendment to the fifth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement was entered into which reduced the commitments from 12 billion to 950 million 

all foreign receivables are owned receivables and are not included in our receivable securitization program at december 31 2016  and 2015  there was 591 million  and 614 million  respectively of shortterm debt outstanding under our securitization facility 

credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables 

we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers payments from customers are generally due within 14 days of billing we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible once they age past 90 days and are deemed uncollectible from the customer we provide an allowance for receivables aged less than 90 days that we expect will be uncollectible based on historical collections experience and would include accounts that have filed for bankruptcy at december 31 2016  approximately 95  of outstanding accounts receivable were current accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency recoveries from the thirdparty collection agency are not significant 

impairment of longlived assets intangibles and equity method investment 

we test our other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with management’s intended actions if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows we determine the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally we perform our testing of the asset group at the businessline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

we complete an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and the impairment test consists of two steps as well as a qualitative assessment as appropriate as deemed appropriate we have performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the 

carrying value of net assets likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers and a quantitative stress test of the 

previously completed step 1 test from the prior year updated with current year results weightedaverage cost of capital rates and future projections 

in step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for our reporting units the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangibles as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate 

preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions significant changes in forecasts the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 

based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively on october 1 2016  we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

we also regularly evaluate the carrying value of our equity method investment which is not carried at fair value for otherthantemporary impairment we estimate the fair value of our equity method investment using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares 

or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of our equity method investment in developing the valuation estimate during the fourth quarters of 2016  and 2015  we determined that the performance improvement initiatives in our equity method investment in masternaut group holdings limited masternaut will take longer and be more challenging to implement than originally projected based on revised cash flow projections provided by the business as a result we have recorded a 361 million  and 40 million  noncash impairment charge in our equity method investment for 2016  and 2015  respectively 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to 

apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible on a quarterly basis we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

current guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense 

business combinations 

we have accounted for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income for significant acquisitions we obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction 

estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provisional estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the final amounts recorded the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and is remeasured each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income we estimate the fair value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration using various valuation approaches as well as significant unobservable inputs reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 

stockbased compensation 

we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions or a combination of these shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one year the fair value of restricted stock shares where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock shares based on market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo option pricing model the riskfree interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo option 

pricing model are calculated consistently with those applied in the blackscholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards 

for performancebased restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

adoption of new accounting standards 

going concern 

in august 2013 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201415 “disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” which requires entities to perform interim and annual assessments of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity’s financial statements this asu is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2016 and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted our adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows as it is disclosure based 

simplification of guidance on debt issuance costs 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 20153 “interest—imputation of interest” which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset this asu is effective for us for fiscal years ending after december 15 2015 and interim periods early adoption is permitted in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201515 “interestimputation of interest presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements” which is effective immediately the sec staff clarified that entities may continue presenting unamortized debt issuance costs for lineofcredit arrangements as an assetwe adopted this new guidance on january 1 2016 as a result of the adoption of this asu 06 million  and 15 million  of unamortized debt issuance costs were retrospectively adjusted from prepaid expenses and other current assets to the current portion of notes payable and lines of credit and other assets to notes payable and other obligations less current portion respectively in the our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015 

accounting for employee stockbased payment 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensationstock compensation improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting which requires excess tax benefits recognized on stockbased compensation expense be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis asu 201609 also requires excess tax benefits recognized on stockbased compensation expense be classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows rather than a financing activity companies can elect to apply this provision retrospectively or prospectively asu 201609 also requires entities to elect whether to account for forfeitures as they occur or estimate expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting period this asu is effective for us for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is permitted 

during the third quarter of 2016 we elected to early adopt asu 201609 the adoption of this asu resulted in excess tax benefits being recorded as a reduction of income tax expense prospectively for all periods during 2016 rather than additional paid in capital and an increase in the number of dilutive shares outstanding at the end of each period which resulted in an increase to diluted earnings per share during the respective period as required by asu 201609 excess tax benefits recognized on stockbased compensation expense are classified as an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows on a prospective basis within changes in accounts payable accrued expenses and customer deposits in accordance with asu 201609 prior periods related to the classification of excess tax benefits have not been adjusted we also elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting period as a result of the adoption of asu 201609 the net cumulative effect of this change was not material 

the following table shows the impact of retrospectively applying asu 201609 to the previously issued consolidated statements of operations for the three month period ended march 31 and the three and six month periods ended june 30 in thousands except per share amounts 





the following table shows the impact of retrospectively applying this guidance to the consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended march 31 2016 and six months ended june 30 2016 in thousands 



simplification of balance sheet classification of deferred taxes 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which requires entities to present deferred tax assets dtas and deferred tax liabilities dtls as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet it thus simplifies the current guidance which requires entities to separately present dtas and dtls as current or noncurrent in a classified balance sheet netting of dtas and dtls by tax jurisdiction is still required under the new guidance this asu is effective for us for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted during the fourth quarter of 2016 we elected to early adopt asu 201517 on a 

prospective basis and prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted our adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed the company’s management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards codification asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” which amends the guidance in former asc 605 revenue recognition this amended guidance requires revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods and services when the performance obligation has been satisfied this amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and related cash flows arising from contracts with customers in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 “revenue from contracts with customers deferral of the effective date” which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201608 “revenue from contracts with customers principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net” which clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements in april 2016 the fasb issued asu 201610 identifying performance obligations and licensing which clarifies the accounting for intellectual property licenses and identifying performance obligations in may 2016 the fasb issued asu 201611 rescission of sec guidance because of accounting standards updates 201409 and 201416 pursuant to staff announcements at the march 3 2016 eitf meeting which rescinds certain sec guidance in response to announcements made by the sec staff at the eitfs march 3 2016 meeting and asu 201612 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 narrowscope improvements and practical expedients which clarifies the guidance on collectibility noncash consideration the presentation of sales and other similar taxes collected from customers and contract modifications and completed contracts at transition additionally asu 201612 clarifies that entities electing the full retrospective transition method would no longer be required to disclose the effect of the change in accounting principle on the period of adoption however entities would still be required to disclose the effects on preadoption periods that were retrospectively adjusted these asus are effective for us for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 but permit companies the option to adopt as of the original effective date we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of asc 606 in 2016 we continued our assessment of the new standard with a focus on identifying the performance obligations included within our revenue arrangements with customers and evaluating our methods of estimating the amount of and timing of variable consideration the guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we anticipate selecting the modified retrospective method which would result in an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect if any of applying the standard to contracts in process as of the adoption date under this method we would not restate the prior financial statements presented therefore the new standard requires us to provide additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period during 2018 as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes if any we are continuing our assessment to evaluate the impact of the provisions of asc 606 on the results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

accounting for leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which requires lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of shortterm leases this asu also requires disclosures to provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements this asu is effective for us for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods therein early adoption is permitted the new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and requires application of the new guidance for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

accounting for breakage 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201604 “liabilitiesextinguishments of liabilities recognition of breakage for certain prepaid storedvalue products” which requires entities that sell prepaid stored value products redeemable for goods services or cash at thirdparty merchants to derecognize liabilities related to those products for breakage this asu is effective for us for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted the asu must be adopted using either a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the 

period of adoption or a full retrospective approach our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

cash flow classification 

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments which amends the guidance in asc 230 statement of cash flows this amended guidance reduces the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash which amends the guidance in asc 230 statement of cash flows on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is permitted if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period the amendments in this asu should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes the estimated dollar amounts of payments under contractual obligations identified below as of december 31 2016  for the periods specified 

  



  



management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

adjusted revenues 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted revenues as revenues net less merchant commissions as reflected in our income statement 

we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in thousands 

  



adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stockbased compensation expense related to sharebased compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs discounts and intangible assets c amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables d loss on the early extinguishment of debt e our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment f impairment of equity method investment g nonrecurring net gain at equity method investment and h other noncash adjustments 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

  

  

1 the effective tax rate used to calculate the income tax impact of pretax adjustments during 2014 excludes the impact of a 95 million discrete tax benefit as well as other noncash adjustments and their related income tax expense 

2 other noncash adjustments are unusual items reflecting adjustments to purchase accounting entries for contingent consideration and tax indemnifications for our 2013 acquisitions of db and vb in brazil 

3 the effective tax rate utilized excludes the impact of a onetime tax benefit recognized during 2015 of approximately 08 million as well as adjustments related to our equity method investment for all periods presented 

4 reflects the impact of the companys adoption of accounting standards update 201609 compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting to simplify several aspects of the accounting for the sharebased compensation including the income tax consequences 

  

 excludes the results of our equity method investment on our effective tax rate as results from our equity method investment are reported within the consolidated income statements on a posttax basis and no taxoverbook outside basis differences related to our equity method investment reversed during 2016 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 302  277  and 443  of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2016  were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2016  by approximately 248 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2015  and 2014  were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  by approximately 225 million and 278 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt we invest our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes under our 336 billion  credit facility we have syndicated 202 billion  and 300 million  term loan agreements with a syndicate of term loan a and term loan b investors in the united states respectively as well as a revolving a credit facility of 10 billion  and a revolving b credit facility of 35 million  interest on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement other than the term loan b facility accrues based on the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050  b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100  plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 

based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense would have changed by 279 million 262 million and 316 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2016  management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2016  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  as of december 31 2016  management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

in connection with managements evaluation our management team excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 the internal controls related to two subsidiaries that we acquired during the year ended december 31 2016 and for which financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements 

on august 31 2016 we acquired all of the stock of serviços e tecnologia de pagamentos sa “stp” an electronic toll payments company in brazil and provider of cardless fuel payments at a number of shell sites throughout brazil on august 4 2016 we acquired all of the stock of travelcard nederland bv “travelcard” a leading universal fuel card issuer in the netherlands collectively we refer to these transactions as the acquisitions these acquisitions constituted 18 of total assets at december 31 2016 and 5 of revenues for the year then ended this exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in managements report on internal control over financial reporting the year of acquisition 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2016  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 competition 

we face considerable competition in our business the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service and account management 

 

and price we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors however we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to each of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

we compete with independent fleet card providers providers of card and employee benefit outsourcing services and major financial services companies as well as major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards we also compete with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house accounts as well as other forms of credit our largest independent fleet card and workforce productivity solutions competitors include wex inc us bank voyager fleet systems inc electronic funds source llc world fuel services corporation embratec edenred sodexo inc alelo ebbondacs fleet on demand radius stp and goodcard 

our corporate payments business competes with large financial institutions and american express such entities will often offer extended payment terms as well as more broadly packaged treasury management services in highly competitive situations we differentiate our business primarily based upon the utilization of both open and proprietary payment networks integrated process flows and aggressive vendor enrollment programs which all in turn allow for faster and deeper accounts payable penetration and greater savings on accounts payable spend our business competes on ease of program integration reporting and data customer rebates cardholder features payment terms and network acceptance 

the competitive landscape for openloop stored value cards is fragmented with entities playing different roles and going to market with different distribution strategies program managers include companies such as first data corporation fidelity national information services inc global cash card unirush and skylight financial which is owned by total system services inc payroll companies offering stored value solutions include companies such as automatic data processing inc paychex inc and heartland payment systems inc additionally financial institutions offer stored value products as part of a broader suite of treasury management services or as directtoconsumer replacements for traditional credit or debit cards referred to as general purpose reloadable products such institutions include bank of america citibank jp morgan chase pnc bank us bank and wells fargo bank we do not offer a consumer funded general purpose reloadable card but rather focus on corporate customers utilizing payroll cards to ease their administration and provide a valueadded benefit to their employees 

we primarily compete with a number of national companies in providing closedloop gift cards the largest of which include first data corporation and vantiv inc we also compete with businesses that rely on inhouse solutions we compete for stored value solutions business on the basis of breadth of services systems technology customer service and price 

we also compete with a number of companies in the telematics space the largest of which include fleetmatics omnitracs trimble danaher zonar verizon tomtom digicore transics and fleetlogic

regulatory 

a substantial number of laws and regulations both in the united states and in other jurisdictions apply to businesses offering payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts these laws and regulations are often evolving and sometimes ambiguous or inconsistent and the extent to which they apply to us is at times unclear failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations the limitation suspension or termination of services andor the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including fines certain of our services are also subject to rules set by various payment networks such as mastercard as more fully described below 

the following while not exhaustive is a description of several federal and state laws and regulations in the united states that are applicable to our business the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions also affect us and they may be more or less restrictive than those in the united states and may also impact different parts of our operations in addition the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing revision and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us

government agencies may impose new or additional requirements on money transmission and sales of payment instruments and we expect that compliance costs will increase in the future for our regulated subsidiaries 

privacy and information security regulations 

we provide services that may be subject to privacy laws and regulations of a variety of jurisdictions relevant federal privacy laws include the grammleachbliley act of 1999 which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and indirectly or in some instances directly to companies that provide services to financial institutions these laws and regulations restrict the collection processing storage use and disclosure of personal

credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 

the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 amended provisions of tila that affect consumer credit and also directed the federal reserve board to study the use of credit cards by small businesses and to make legislative recommendations the report concluded that it is not clear whether the potential benefits outweigh the increased cost and reduced credit availability if the disclosure and substantive restrictions applicable to consumer cards were to be applied to small business cards legislation has been introduced from time to time to increase the protections afforded to small businesses that use payment cards if legislation of this kind were enacted our products and services for small businesses could be adversely impacted

antimoney laundering and counter terrorist regulations 

the currency and foreign transactions reporting act the bsa which is also known as the bank secrecy act and which has been amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 contains a variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering our business in canada is also subject to proceeds of crime money laundering and terrorist financing act or the pctfa which is a corollary to the bsa among other things the bank secrecy act and implementing regulations issued by the us treasury department require financialservices providers to establish antimoney laundering programs to not engage in terrorist financing to report suspicious activity and to maintain a number of related records 

through certain subsidiaries we are registered money services businesses as a result we have established antimoney laundering compliance programs that include i internal policies and controls ii designation of a compliance officer iii ongoing employee training and iv an independent review function we have developed and implemented compliance programs comprised of policies procedures systems and internal controls to monitor and address various legal requirements and developments 

in addition provisions of the bsa known as the prepaid access rule issued by the financial crimes enforcement network of the us department of the treasury fincen impose certain obligations such as registration and collection of consumer information on “providers” of certain prepaid access programs including the stored value products issued by our sponsor banks for which we serve as program manager fincen has taken the position that where the issuing bank has principal oversight and control of such prepaid access programs no other participant in the distribution chain would be required to register as a provider under the prepaid access rule despite this position we have opted to register as a provider of prepaid access through our subsidiary comdata inc we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control or ofac that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries their governments and in certain circumstances their nationals narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau or cfpb which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit in addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb is authorized to issue rules prohibiting udaap by persons offering consumer financial products or services and their service providers and has authority to enforce these consumer financial protection laws and cfpb rules the cfpb has not defined what is a consumer financial product or service but has indicated informally that in some instances small businesses may be covered under consumer protection 

 

as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs 

in addition the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the federal reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing clearing and settling the transaction payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions in july 2011 the federal reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees effective in october 2011 with certain exemptions debit interchange rates are capped at 021 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus for qualifying issuing financial institutions an additional 001 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs in march 2014 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia overturned the us district court for the district of columbia’s july 2013 ruling that held the federal reserve’s regulations implementing the durbin amendment invalid while the court of appeals upheld most of the federal reserve’s implementing regulations the court has remanded to the federal reserve for further explanation of its regulations regarding transactionsmonitoring costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations because we qualify for an exemption for the majority of our debit transactions 

the implementation of the doddfrank act is ongoing and as a result its overall impact remains unclear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that it is possible that we could be further directly or indirectly impacted 

antibribery regulations 

the fcpa prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures and includes antibribery provisions enforced by the department of justice and accounting provisions enforced by the sec the statute has a broad reach covering all us companies and citizens doing business abroad among others and defining a foreign official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens affiliated with foreign governmentrun or owned organizations the statute also requires maintenance of appropriate books and records and maintenance of adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible fcpa violations

state usury laws 

extensions of credit under many of our card products may be treated as commercial loans in some states usury laws limit the interest rates that can be charged not only on consumer loans but on commercial loans as well to the extent that these usury laws apply we are limited in the amount of interest that we can charge and collect from our customers because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions we utilize choice of law provisions in our cardholder agreements as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply in addition the interest rates on certain of our card products are set based upon the usury limit of the cardholder’s state with respect to card products where we work with a partner or issuing bank the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and “exports” the usury limit of that state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2015 approximately 15 of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 12 of our consolidated revenue in 2015 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not credit worthy or are fraudulently completed changes in our industry customer demand and in relation to our fleet customers movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result could lead to increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments we derived approximately 72 of our consolidated revenues from these fees and charges during the year ended december 31 2015 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity or the extent to which they use optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer in the fleet card business our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers in the commercial payments business we face a variety of competitors some of which have greater financial resources name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies among others competitors in the mobile telematics business include the major car companies wireless phone service providers and independent services companies among others we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of food fuel toll transportation and fleet cards and vouchers commercial fleet cards offered by the major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service account management and price we may experience competitive 

 

disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers such as treasury management commercial lending and credit card processing by providing these other services that we do not provide these competitors have an advantage of being able to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships sometimes at a discount for example in the commercial payments business we compete with full service banks that are able to offer treasury management and commercial lending in addition to commercial payment solutions if price competition continues to intensify we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers decrease the prices of our products and services or lose customers each of which could adversely affect our operating results in the fleet card business major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as well as offer add on complementary services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” during 2015 our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for less than 7 of our consolidated revenue our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from about two to seven years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected also our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period the use 

 

of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win this business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base in the closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel maintenance services and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected 

with respect to the closedloop networks we utilize a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers as well as from our new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants and service garages typically have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew on the same basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships failure to continue such relationships on similarly attractive economic terms the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

we depend on our relationships with major truck stop merchants to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers we must maintain these relationships to effectively serve our customers that use these merchants if we are unable to maintain these relationships our overtheroad card businesses may be adversely affected 

we have long standing relationships with major truck stop merchants to accept our overtheroad fuel cards overtheroad customers purchase a significant proportion of their fuel at major truck stop merchants the loss of existing major truck stop merchant relationships or failure to continue such relationships on similar terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our overtheroad fuel card customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other business related products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the united states and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the united states europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other business related products and services by our customers the commercial payments industry in general and our commercial payment solutions business specifically depends heavily upon the overall level of spending unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession or other changes may lead our corporate customers to reduce their spending resulting in reduced demand for or use of our products and services in addition unfavorable changes in economic conditions may lead our fleet card customers to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services as a result a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states or abroad could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase a weakening economy could also force some retailers and merchants to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and transaction declines in addition demand for fuel and other business related products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration of the ongoing sluggish economic conditions in the united states europe russia latin america australia and new zealand as a result continued weakness in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example within the past five years we have entered into the corporate payments stored value card vehicle maintenance management and telematics business in the united states and europe and transaction processing fuel food toll and transportation card and voucher businesses in brazil and mexico we may continue to enter new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis 

the products we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions all at high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we may rely on third parties to develop or codevelop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms or at all and these relationships may not be successful in addition partners some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties even if we are successful in developing new services and technologies these new services and technologies may not achieve broad acceptance due to a variety of factors including a lack of industrywide standards competing products and services or resistance to these changes from our customers in addition we may not be able to derive revenue from these efforts 

if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2015 we had approximately 294 billion of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew every three years 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a three year term although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually in the past there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us for example the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility during the financial crisis that began in 2008 

 

also a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 28 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound brazilian real russian ruble mexican peso czech koruna euro australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer in the united states and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the united states 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in australia austria azerbaijan belarus belgium botswana brazil bulgaria canada croatia the czech republic denmark estonia finland france georgia germany greece hong kong hungary ireland italy kazakhstan latvia lithuania luxembourg macau malaysia mexico moldova mongolia morocco the netherlands new zealand norway papua new guinea philippines poland portugal romania russia singapore slovakia slovenia south africa spain sweden switzerland turkey united arab emirates the united kingdom and ukraine we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate specifically russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the united states for example russia and the ukraine are experiencing significant unrest which could escalate into broader armed conflict and additional economic sanctions by the us united nations or other countries against russia in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the united states these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the united states we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems telecommunications data centers and call centers including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to provide reliable service to customers cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data centers and call centers as well as third party labor and services providers our business involves processing large numbers of transactions the movement of large sums of money and management of large amounts of data we rely on the ability of our employees contractors suppliers systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure uninterrupted and errorfree manner 

our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors such as power availability telecommunications carrier redundancy embargos and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries 

we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data however there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown security breach or catastrophic event such as fire explosion flood pandemic natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure or physical breakin we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but in any event these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects 

 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our products and services are based on proprietary and thirdparty network technology and processing systems that may encounter development delays and could be susceptible to undetected errors viruses or defects development delays system errors viruses or defects that result in service interruption or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation and subject us to thirdparty liability in addition errors viruses and defects in our network technology and processing systems could result in additional development costs and the diversion of our technical and other resources from other development efforts or operations further our attempts to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our agreements may not be successful 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers we do not maintain insurance to protect us against such losses we bear similar risk relating to fraudulent acts of employees or contractors for which we maintain insurance however the conditions or limits of coverage may be insufficient to protect us against such losses 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft a single significant incident of fraud or increases in the overall level of fraud involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions including significant monetary fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect the data we collect which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information social security numbers expense data and credit card debit card and checking account numbers we keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition under payment network rules regulatory requirements and related obligations we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties such as third party service providers vendors partners and others which we refer to collectively as associated participants the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding 

 

of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the market for our commercial payment fleet and stored value card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers if businesses do not continue to use or increase their use of credit debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe that future growth in the use of credit debit and stored value cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of services offered in order for us to consistently increase and maintain profitability businesses must continue to use and increase the use of electronic payment methods including credit debit and stored value cards moreover if there is an adverse development in the payments industry in general such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business or a wellpublicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally 

furthermore new technologies may displace credit debit andor stored value cards as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses a decline in the acceptance and use of credit debit andor stored value cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards food vouchers and cards transportation and toll road payments telematics solutions and fleet maintenance management services is also evolving and those portions of our business are subject to similar risks 

if we fail to retain any of our stored value gift card customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all which will reduce our revenue 

most of our stored value gift card customers in the united states are national retailers during 2015 a majority of our gift card revenue was derived from the design and purchase of gift card inventory with the remaining portion of our 2015 gift card revenue derived primarily from processing fees if we fail to retain any of these customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all because there is a limited number of national retailers in the united states and nearly all of those other national retailers already have a gift card solution in place either inhouse or with one of our competitors as such any loss of a stored value gift card customer would reduce our revenue 

adverse weather conditions across a geographic region can cause a decline in the number and amount of payment transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

when travel is severely curtailed across a geographic region during adverse weather conditions the number and amount of transactions we process can be significantly diminished particularly in our fleet business and revenue can materially decline for example during parts of january 2014 severe winter weather shut down a large portion of the eastern united states prolonged adverse weather events especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our fuel card workforce payment solutions and gift card businesses’ results are subject to seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income 

our fuel card and workforce payment solutions businesses have experienced in the past and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and profit which are impacted during the first and fourth quarter each year by the weather holidays in the us christmas being celebrated in russia in january and lower business levels in brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration our gift card business has experienced in the past and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns historically gift card business revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season  

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 73 of our total assets at december 31 2015 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

finally we use open source software in connection with our technology and services companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software open source software is also provided without warranty and may therefore include bugs security vulnerabilities or other defects some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software andor make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost while we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related technology or service such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the united states and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied 

 

requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

for example certain of our subsidiaries are currently licensed as money transmitters on the state level by the banking departments or other state agencies of numerous states continued licensing by these states is subject to periodic examinations and ongoing satisfaction of compliance requirements regarding safety and soundness including maintenance of certain levels of net worth surety bonding permissible investments in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding payment obligations with respect to certain of our products subject to licensure and record keeping and reporting if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain maintain or renew necessary licenses or comply with other relevant state regulations they will not be able to operate as a money transmitter in those states or provide certain other services and products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the financial crimes enforcement network or fincen and must comply with applicable antimoney laundering requirements including implementation of an effective antimony laundering program changes in this regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business 

regulatory changes may also restrict or eliminate present and future business opportunities available to certain of our subsidiaries for example the durbin amendment to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 which serves to limit interchange fees may restrict or otherwise impact the way our subsidiaries do business or limit their ability to charge certain fees to customers the cfpb is also engaged in rule making and regulation of the payments industry in particular with respect to prepaid cards the cfpb’s focus on the protection of consumers might also extend to many of our small business customers as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changing regulations or standards in the area of privacy and data protection could also adversely impact us in addition certain of our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authority and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

our business is subject to us federal antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 which we refer to collectively as the bsa our business in canada is also subject to proceeds of crime money laundering and terrorist financing act or the pctfa which is a corollary to the bsa the bsa among other things requires money services businesses such as money transmitters issuers of money orders and official checks and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records the pctfa imposes similar requirements 

many of these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly with increasing frequency federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training monitoring and compliance including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and 

 

appropriate manner we may be subject to injunctions other sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties and our reputation may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

in addition we have endeavored to structure our businesses in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions payroll taxes and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws their interpretations or their enforcement could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services 

governmental bodies in the united states and abroad have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations restricting the transfer of and requiring safeguarding of nonpublic personal information for example in the united states all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to ensure the privacy and security of consumer financial information in connection with providing services to our clients we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks our sponsor bank and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer information these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as payment card industry or pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer personal information received from our customers our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level our compliance costs may increase our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our acquisition documents include warranties covenants and conditions regarding various tax matters that occurred prior to the acquisition supported by indemnification and in some cases holdbacks or escrows from 

 

the sellers the obligations of the sellers are also generally subject to various limitations in the event of a tax claim related to a preacquisition tax year we would seek to recover costs and losses from the sellers under the acquisition agreement however there is no assurance that any indemnification holdback or escrow would be sufficient or that we would recover such costs or losses which could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in increased expenses 

we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our current and past operations including employmentrelated disputes contract disputes intellectual property disputes government audits and proceedings customer disputes and tort claims responding to such claims may be difficult and expensive and we may not prevail in some proceedings the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief which if granted would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings regardless of whether we prevail or not such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have had inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business such inquiries may result in various audits reviews and investigations which can be time consuming and expensive an adverse outcome of any investigation by or other inquiries from such bodies or agencies could have a material adverse effect on us and result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties changes in personnel and increased review and scrutiny by customers regulatory authorities the media and others which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information about our judicial and other proceedings see “business—legal proceedings” 

 

our revenues from mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of mastercard it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations through our financial institution sponsors 

a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the united states and canada registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive even if we pursue sponsorship by alternative member banks similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist  in addition mastercard routinely updates and modifies its requirements changes in the requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services if we do not comply with mastercard requirements it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registration which allows us to process transactions on its networks the termination of our registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers which would have a material adverse effect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network card transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and the uk bribery act the fcpa prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to 

 

foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following

executive overview 

we operate in two segments which we refer to as our north america and international segments see “results of operations” for additional segment information 

our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue” for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 our north america and international segments generated the following revenue 

 

 sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions as illustrated in the diagram below a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners for whom we manage card programs members of our proprietary networks who are provided access to our products and services and commercial businesses to whom we provide workforce payment productivity solutions revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as our customers and partners through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel cards corporate cards virtual cards purchasing cards te cards gift cards stored value payroll cards vehicle maintenance food fuel toll and transportation cards and vouchers or lodging services to our customers 

the following diagram illustrates a typical card transaction flow but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance lodging and food fuel toll and transportation card and voucher products substituting transactions for gallons this representative model may not include all of our businesses 

illustrative transaction flow 

 

 

from our customers and partners we derive revenue from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and charges which can be fixed fees cost plus a markup or based on a percentage discount from retail prices our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue mostly from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses as illustrated in the table below the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of the product plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit 

the following table presents an illustrative revenue model for transactions with the merchant which is primarily applicable to fuel based product transactions but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance lodging and food fuel toll and transportation card and voucher products substituting transactions for gallons this representative model may not include all of our businesses

 set forth below are our sources of revenue for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues 

 

  

  

revenue per transaction set forth below is revenue per transaction information for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

 

  

  revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and the overall macroeconomic environment including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases as macroeconomic factors change and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates see “results of operations” for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction 

from 2014 to 2015 total transactions increased from 6524 million to 19 billion an increase of 12 billion or 1838 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america segment primarily due to our acquisition of comdata in november 2014 of which 13 billion and 270 million transactions are attributable to svs for 2015 and 2014 respectively as well as from organic growth in our us businesses transaction volumes in our international segment decreased slightly by 45 primarily due to market softness in some of our international businesses 

from 2013 to 2014 total transactions increased from 3275 million to 6524 million an increase of 3249 million or 992 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america and international segments primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2014 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 in 2014 transaction volume was primarily affected by the inclusion of approximately 270 million transactions related to our svs product which is part of the comdata business acquired in november 2014 

sources of expenses 

we incur expenses in the following categories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

adjusted revenues adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share set forth below are adjusted revenues adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

 

 we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate thus we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental nongaap financial measures of operating performance see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures” 

factors and trends impacting our business 

we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance

revenues and revenue per transaction 

our consolidated revenue increased from 11994 million in 2014 to 17029 million in 2015 an increase of 5035 million or 420 the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate thus we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment in total we believe it negatively impacted our consolidated adjusted revenues for 2015 over the comparable period in 2014 by approximately 179 million changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated adjusted revenues of approximately 90 million due to unfavorable fluctuations in rates in all geographies in 2015 over 2014 in addition we believe the impact of lower fuel prices partially offset by higher fuel spread margins had an additional unfavorable impact on consolidated adjusted revenues of approximately 89 million 

consolidated revenue per transaction decreased from 184 in 2014 to 092 in 2015 a decrease of 092 per transaction or 500 excluding the impact of the svs business which had approximately 13 billion and 270 million transactions in 2015 and 2014 respectively at a lower revenue per transaction revenue per transaction for 2015 decreased 102  to 278 from 310 over the comparable period in 2014 revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography the relevant merchant and customer relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the revenue mix was influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in the business and fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment primarily fuel prices and foreign exchange rates 

north america segment revenues and revenue per transaction 

north america revenue increased from 6683 million in 2014 to 12320 million in 2015 an increase of 5636 million or 843 the increase in our north america revenue was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 north america segment revenue per transaction decreased from 145 in 2014 to 074 in 2015 a decrease of 071 or 492 excluding the impact of the svs business which had approximately 13 billion and 270 million transactions in 2015 and 2014 respectively at a lower revenue per transaction revenue per transaction in our north america segment in 2015 decreased 159 to 289 from 344 over the comparable period in 2014 revenue per transaction can vary based on the geography the relevant merchant and customer relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products and services purchased revenue per transaction decreased primarily due to the impact of lower fuel prices and fuel price spreads during 2015 versus the prior year 

international segment revenue 

international segment revenue decreased from 5311 million in 2014 to 4709 million in 2015 a decrease of 602 million or 113 the decrease in international segment revenue was due primarily to the following 

 

 as discussed we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on international adjusted revenues of approximately 901 million due to unfavorable fluctuations in rates in all geographies in 2015 over 2014 

 

 international segment revenue per transaction decreased from 276 in 2014 to 256 in 2015 a decrease of 020 per transaction or 72 due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates across all of our geographies this unfavorable impact was partially offset by organic revenue growth in several products 

consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions increased from 963 million in 2014 to 1083 million in 2015 an increase of 120 million or 125 this increase was due primarily to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel which impacted merchant commissions in certain card programs as well as the impact of higher volume in certain revenue streams where merchant commission are paid partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates 

processing processing expenses increased from 1733 million in 2014 to 3311 million in 2015 an increase of 1577 million or 910 our processing expenses primarily increased due to the impact of our acquisition of comdata completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates 

selling selling expenses increased from 755 million in 2014 to 1091 million in 2015 an increase of 335 million or 444 the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of comdata completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from 2060 million in 2014 to 2977 million in 2015 an increase of 918 million or 445 the increase was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of comdata completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental stock based compensation of 525 million partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 1124 million in 2014 to 1935 million in 2015 an increase of 811 million or 722 the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of comdata completed during the fourth quarter of 2014 which resulted in an increase of 913 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets for customer and vendor relationships trade names and trademarks noncompete agreements and software as well as depreciation of acquired fixed assets partially offset by decreases due to changes in foreign exchange rates 

other operating net other operating net decreased from a 295 million favorable impact in 2014 to a 42 million favorable impact in 2015 a decrease of 253 million or 858 in 2015 the balance relates primarily to the net favorable impact of the additional reversals of various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db and vb in brazil included in other operating net in 2014 is 281 million of favorable impact related to fair value adjustments recorded for contingent consideration arrangements for our acquisition of vb in brazil and 14 million from the reversal of other various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db and vb in brazil 

equity method investment loss 

on april 28 2014 we acquired a minority interest in masternaut a provider of telematics solutions to commercial fleets in europe which we account for as an equity method investment the increase in equity method investment loss from 86 million in 2014 to 577 million in 2015 was primarily due to a noncash impairment charge of 40 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 we regularly evaluate our investments which are not carried at fair value for other than temporary impairment in accordance with u s gaap during the fourth quarter we determined that the performance improvement initiatives at masternaut will take longer to implement than we originally projected as a result we have recorded a 40 million noncash impairment charge in our equity method investment 

interest expense net 

interest expense increased from 289 million in 2014 to 713 million in 2015 an increase of 425 million or 1472 the increase is due to an increase in borrowings in 2015 over 2014 primarily due to funding of the purchase price for our acquisition of comdata the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility excluding the relevant unused credit facility fees

 

 the average unused credit facility fee for domestic revolver a was 035 and 031 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the average unused credit facility fee for foreign revolver b was 030 in 2014 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2014 relates to our writeoff of 158 million of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility and entry into our new credit agreement along with our acquisition of comdata 

 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 1442 million in 2014 to 1736 million in 2015 an increase of 293 million or 203 our effective tax rate increased from 281 in 2014 to 324 in 2015 we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in certain nonus taxing jurisdictions are lower than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the nondeductible impairment charge of 40 million related to our minority investment in masternaut as well as the inclusion of the comdata business which operates primarily in the us with a higher overall tax rate partially offsetting these negative impacts was the continued decrease in the uk statutory tax rates these initiatives involved amending tax returns for several prior years and produced tax savings of approximately 79 million recorded in 2015 we expect that the impact of these planning initiatives will have a favorable impact on tax rates in future years included in 2014 was onetime tax favorability due to entity reorganization in brazil which allowed the reversal of deferred tax liability of 95 million setup at the time of acquisition in 2013 

net income 

for the reasons discussed above our net income decreased from 3687 million in 2014 to 3624 million in 2015 a decrease of 63 million or 17 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 5654 million in 2014 to 6675 million in 2015 an increase of 1021 million or 181 consolidated operating margin was 471 in 2014 and 392 in 2015 the increase in operating income was due primarily to the impact of our acquisition of comdata completed in november 2014 these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment primarily due to lower fuel prices in north america and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates as previously discussed changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated operating income of approximately 53 million due to unfavorable fluctuations in rates in all geographies results were also negatively impacted by the increase in amortization and depreciation expense related to assets acquired in 2014 and increased stock based compensation expense during 2015 the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the impact of increased operating expenses associated with comdata including increased depreciation and amortization expense 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north america segment operating income 

north america operating income increased from 2873 million in 2014 to 4420 million in 2015 an increase of 1547 million or 539 north america operating margin was 430 in 2014 and 359 in 2015 the increase in operating income was due primarily to the impact of our acquisition of comdata in november 2014 as well as organic growth in the business the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the impact of increased operating expenses associated with comdata including increased depreciation and amortization in addition we had increased stock based compensation expense the majority of which is recorded in our north american segment furthermore operating results were also negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment primarily due to lower fuel prices partially offset by higher fuel spread margins 

 

international segment operating income 

international operating income decreased from 2781 million in 2014 to 2255 million in 2015 a decrease of 527 million or 189 international operating margin was 524 in 2014 and 479 in 2015 the decrease in operating income was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the macroeconomic environment specifically unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates which we believe negatively impacted operating income by approximately 53 million as well as the negative impact of fuel prices internationally the negative impact of the environment was partially offset by the impact of organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transaction in local currency the impact of changes in fuel price spreads was negligible

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from 1423 million in 2013 to 2060 million in 2014 an increase of 637 million or 448 our general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014 as well as approximately 226 million of incremental onetime deal related costs related to severance and legal fees accounting tax and various advisory fees as well as additional stock based compensation expense of 128 million 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 727 million in 2013 to 1124 million in 2014 an increase of 396 million or 545 the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to acquisitions completed during 2013 and 2014 which resulted in an increase of 383 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets for customer and vendor relationships trade names and trademarks noncompete agreements and software and increased depreciation expense 

other operating net other operating net of 295 million in 2014 represents the 281 million favorable impact of fair value adjustments recorded related to contingent consideration arrangements for our acquisition of vb in brazil and the net favorable impact of 14 million from the reversal of other various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db and vb in brazil 

equity method investment loss 

on april 28 2014 we acquired a minority interest in masternaut a provider of telematics solutions to commercial fleets in europe which we account for as an equity method investment the loss at masternaut was driven primarily by amortization of intangible assets at this investment of approximately 80 million in 2014 

interest expense net 

interest expense increased from 164 million in 2013 to 289 million in 2014 an increase of 124 million or 753 the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in borrowings in 2014 over 2013 primarily due to funding the purchase price for acquisitions as well as increased interest rates as a result of the uptick in our leverage ratio due to the additional borrowings to fund acquisitions the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility excluding the relevant unused credit facility fees 

 

  

the average unused credit facility fee for domestic revolver a was 031 and 026 in 2014 and 2013 respectively the average unused credit facility fee for foreign revolver b was 030 and 027 in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to our writeoff of 158 million of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility and entry into our new credit agreement along with our recent acquisition of comdata 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 1191 million in 2013 to 1442 million in 2014 an increase of 252 million or 211 our effective tax rate decreased from 295 in 2013 to 281 in 2014 the effective tax rate in 2014 was favorably impacted by entity reorganization in brazil which allowed the reversal of deferred tax liability of 95 million setup at the time of acquisition in 2013 

we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in certain nonus taxing jurisdictions are lower than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates the lower tax rate in 2014 was also driven by a shift in the mix of earnings largely due to acquisitions to foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

net income 

for the reasons discussed above our net income increased from 2845 million in 2013 to 3687 million in 2014 an increase of 842 million or 296 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 4206 million in 2013 to 5654 million in 2014 an increase of 1448 million or 344 consolidated operating margin was 470 in 2013 and 471 in 2014 the increase in operating income is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed during 2013 and 2014 organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transactions we believe the impact of the macroeconomic environment was positive to consolidated operating results in 2014 over 2013 primarily due to higher fuel spread margins these positive drivers of consolidated results were partially offset by incremental stock based compensation expense increased amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets increased bad debt expense in our russian business and incremental onetime costs related to acquisitions of 226 million 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north america segment operating income 

north america operating income increased from 2205 million in 2013 to 2873 million in 2014 an increase of 668 million or 303 north america operating margin was 479 in 2013 and 430 in 2014 the increase in operating income is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014 as well as organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transaction we believe that the impact of the macroeconomic environment was positive to north american operating results in 2014 over 2013 primarily 

 

due to higher fuel spread margins the decrease in operating margin is due primarily to the impact of increased stock based compensation expense the majority of which is recorded in our north america segment as well as incremental onetime deal related expenses of 266 million primarily incurred related to our acquisition of comdata during 2014 

international segment operating income 

international operating income increased from 2001 million in 2013 to 2781 million in 2014 an increase of 780 million or 390 international operating margin was 461 in 2013 and 524 in 2014 the increase in operating income and operating margin is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2014 and organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transaction we believe that the impact of the macroeconomic environment was negative to international operating results in 2014 over 2013 due primarily to unfavorable fluctuations in the brazilian real british pound and russian ruble included in international operating income was the favorable impact of adjustments recorded related to contingent consideration arrangements for our acquisition of vb in brazil of 281 million the net favorable impact from reversal of other various contingent liabilities for tax indemnifications related to our acquisitions of db and vb in brazil of approximately 14 million and incremental savings on deal fees over the comparable period in 2013 of 41 million these favorable items contributed to the increase in operating margin from 2013 to 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness complete acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

sources of liquidity 

at december 31 2015 our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance totaled 4472 million our restricted cash balance at december 31 2015 totaled 1675 million restricted cash primarily represents customer deposits in the czech republic and in our comdata business in the us which we are restricted from using other than to repay customer deposits 

at december 31 2015 cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested is 2587 million all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries excluding restricted cash are available for general corporate purposes our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time we currently believe that funds generated from our us operations along with available borrowing capacity in the us will be sufficient to fund our us operations for the foreseeable future and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our us operations however if at a future date or time these funds are needed for our operations in the us or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds no assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof the tax consequences related thereto or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic fuel card receivables to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants within seven days of receiving the merchant billing as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we 

 

also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions at december 31 2015 we had the ability to generate approximately 4 million of additional liquidity under our securitization facility at december 31 2015 we had approximately 875 million available under our credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

 

 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased from 6083 million in 2014 to 7546 million in 2015 despite a slight decrease in net income the increase is primarily due to changes in working capital and increases in certain noncash expenses including amortization of intangible assets of 736 million stockbased compensation of 525 million and equity method investment loss of 491 million 

net cash provided by operating activities increased from 3757 million in 2013 to 6083 million in 2014 the increase is primarily due to changes in working capital increases in amortization of acquired intangibles of 364 million as well as additional net income during 2014 over 2013 of 842 million partially offset by fair value adjustments for contingent consideration of 275 million 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased from 25941 million in 2014 to 994 million in 2015 this decrease is primarily due to the reduction in cash outlay for acquisitions including equity method investments over the comparable period 

net cash used in investing activities increased from 7491 million in 2013 to 25941 million in 2014 the increase is primarily due to the increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2014 specifically 24 billion related to comdata 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was 21623 million in 2014 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 6481 million in 2015 the change is primarily due to increased net borrowings on our credit facility and our securitization facility in 2014 primarily due to funding the purchase price for comdata additionally we made payments on contingent consideration arrangements of 42 million in 2015 that were not made in 2014 

net cash provided by financing activities increased from 4357 million in 2013 to 21623 million in 2014 the increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to increased net borrowings on our credit facility and securitization facility of 14564 million and 275 million respectively in 2014 over 2013 primarily due to funding the purchase price for comdata 

 

capital spending summary 

our capital expenditures increased from 271 million in 2014 to 419 million 2015 an increase of 148 million or 547 the increase was primarily due to the impact of our acquisition of comdata in november 2014

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements

impairment of longlived assets intangibles and equity method investment 

we test our other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with management’s intended actions if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows we determine the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally we perform our testing of the asset group at the businessline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

we complete an asset impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and the impairment test consists of two steps as well as a qualitative assessment as appropriate as deemed appropriate we have performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the 

 

carrying value of net assets likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step 1 test from the prior year updated with current year results weightedaverage cost of capital rates and future projections 

we completed step 1 of the goodwill impairment testing for certain of our reporting units for which the qualitative assessment was not performed in this first step the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangibles as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate 

preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions significant changes in forecasts the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 

based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively and qualitatively on october 1 2015 we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

we also regularly evaluate the carrying value of our equity method investment which is not carried at fair value for otherthantemporary impairment we estimate the fair value of our equity method investment using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares 

 

or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of our equity method investment in developing the valuation estimate during the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined that the performance improvement initiatives in our equity method investment in masternaut will take longer to implement than we originally projected as a result we have recorded a 40 million noncash impairment charge in our equity method investment 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible on a quarterly basis we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with authoritative literature we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

current guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained 

business combinations 

we have accounted for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income for significant acquisitions we obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction 

estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase 

 

price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and is remeasured each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income we estimate the fair value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration using various valuation approaches as well as significant unobservable inputs reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 

stockbased compensation 

we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions or a combination of these shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one year the fair value of restricted stock shares where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock shares based on market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo option pricing model the riskfree interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo option pricing model are calculated consistently with those applied in the blackscholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards 

for performancebased restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

adoption of new accounting standards 

discontinued operations reporting 

in april 2014 the fasb issued an asu 201408 “discounted operations reporting” that changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations this update will have the impact of reducing the frequency of disposals reported as discontinued operations by requiring such a disposal to represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results this update also expands the disclosures for discontinued operations and requires new disclosures related to individually significant disposals that do not qualify as discontinued operations we adopted this new guidance on january 1 2015 the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows as we did not have discontinued operations 

stockbased payment awards with performance targets 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu 201412 “sharebased payment awards with performance targets that are attainable after the requisite service period” for companies that grant their employees sharebased 

 

payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period we adopted this new guidance on january 1 2015 the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

simplification of business combination measurementperiod adjustments 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 “business combinations simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined prior to the issuance of the standard entities were required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination we adopted this new guidance during the third quarter of 2015 the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows furthermore measurement period adjustments recorded in the year ended december 31 2015 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

going concern 

in august 2013 the fasb issued asu 201415 “disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” which requires entities to perform interim and annual assessments of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity’s financial statements this asu is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2016 and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows as it is disclosure based 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” which amends the guidance in former asc 605 revenue recognition this amended guidance requires revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods and services when the performance obligation has been satisfied this amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and related cash flows arising from contracts with customers in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 “revenue from contracts with customers deferral of the effective date” which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year this asu is effective for us for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 but permits companies the option to adopt as of the original effective date we anticipate selecting the modified retrospective method during transition and are currently evaluating the impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

simplification of guidance on debt issuance costs 

in april 2015 the fasb issued asu 201503 “interest—imputation of interest” which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset this asu is effective for us for fiscal years ending after december 15 2015 and interim periods early adoption is permitted in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201515 “interest—imputation of interest presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit 

 

arrangements” which is effective immediately this asu states that entities may continue presenting unamortized debt issuance costs for lineofcredit arrangements as an asset the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

simplification of balance sheet classification of deferred taxes 

in november 2015 the fasb issued asu 201517 “balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which requires entities to present deferred tax assets dtas and deferred tax liabilities dtls as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet it thus simplifies the current guidance which requires entities to separately present dtas and dtls as current or noncurrent in a classified balance sheet netting of dtas and dtls by tax jurisdiction is still required under the new guidance this asu is effective for the company for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods the company’s adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes the estimated dollar amounts of payments under contractual obligations identified below as of december 31 2015 for the periods specified 

 

  

    

management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

adjusted revenues 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted revenues as revenues net less merchant commissions as reflected in our income statement 

we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in thousands 

 

 adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stockbased compensation expense related to sharebased compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs discounts and intangible assets c amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables d loss on the early extinguishment of debt e our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment f impairment of equity method investment and g other noncash adjustments 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

 

  

    




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 277 443 and 485 of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2015 were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2015 by approximately 225 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2014 and 2013 were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 by approximately 278 million and 200 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt we invest our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes under our 3355 billion credit facility we have syndicated 202 billion and 300 million term loan agreements with a syndicate of term loan a and term loan b investors in the united states respectively as well as a revolving a credit facility of 10 billion and a revolving b credit facility of 35 million interest on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at our election at the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or at our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100 plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 

prior to entering into our new credit agreement we had borrowings outstanding under the existing credit facility on november 14 2014 proceeds from our new credit agreement were used to retire our existing indebtedness under the existing credit facility under our previously existing credit facility we had a syndicated 550 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of term loan b investors in the united states as well as a 850 million revolving credit facility interest on amounts outstanding under the previously existing credit agreement bore interest at our election at the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or at our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100 plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 

based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense would have changed by 232 million 292 million and 114 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices 

 

could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2015 management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2015 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework as of december 31 2015 management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

competition 

we face considerable competition in our business the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service and account management and price we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors however we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to each of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

we compete with independent fleet card providers providers of card and employee benefit outsourcing services and major financial services companies as well as major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards we also compete with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house accounts as well as other forms of credit our largest independent fleet card and workforce productivity solutions competitors include wex inc us bank voyager fleet systems inc electronic funds source llc world fuel services corporation embratec edenred sodexo inc alelo ebbondacs fleet on demand radius stp and goodcard

the competitive landscape for openloop stored value cards is fragmented with entities playing different roles and going to market with different distribution strategies program managers include companies such as first data corporation fidelity national information services inc global cash card unirush and skylight financial which is owned by total system services inc payroll companies offering stored value solutions include companies such as automatic data processing inc paychex inc and heartland payment systems inc additionally financial institutions offer stored value products as part of a broader suite of treasury management services or as directtoconsumer replacements for traditional credit or debit cards referred to as general purpose reloadable products such institutions include bank of america citibank jp morgan chase pnc bank us bank and wells fargo bank we do not offer a consumer funded general purpose reloadable card but rather focus on corporate customers utilizing payroll cards to ease their administration and provide a valueadded benefit to their employees 

we primarily compete with a number of national companies in providing closedloop gift cards the largest of which include first data corporation and vantiv inc we also compete with businesses that rely on inhouse solutions we compete for stored value solutions business on the basis of breadth of services systems technology customer service and price 

we also compete with a number of companies in the telematics space the largest of which include fleetmatics omnitracs trimble danaher zonar verizon tomtom digicore transics and fleetlogic

the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 amended provisions of tila that affect consumer credit and also directed the federal reserve board to study the use of credit cards by small businesses and to make legislative recommendations the report concluded that it is not clear whether the potential benefits outweigh the increased cost and reduced credit availability if the disclosure and substantive restrictions applicable to consumer cards were to be applied to small business cards legislation has been introduced from time to time to increase the protections afforded to small businesses that use payment cards if legislation of this kind were enacted our products and services for small businesses could be adversely impacted

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the consumer financial protection 

 

bureau or cfpb which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit in addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws the cfpb is authorized to issue rules prohibiting udaap by persons offering consumer financial products or services and their service providers and has authority to enforce these consumer financial protection laws and cfpb rules the cfpb has not defined what is a consumer financial product or service but has indicated informally that in some instances small businesses may be covered under consumer protection as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs 

in addition the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the federal reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing clearing and settling the transaction payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions in july 2011 the federal reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees effective in october 2011 with certain exemptions debit interchange rates are capped at 021 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus for qualifying issuing financial institutions an additional 001 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs in march 2014 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia overturned the us district court for the district of columbia’s july 2013 ruling that held the federal reserve’s regulations implementing the durbin amendment invalid while the court of appeals upheld most of the federal reserve’s implementing regulations the court has remanded to the federal reserve for further explanation of its regulations regarding transactionsmonitoring costs regardless of the outcome of the litigation the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations because we qualify for an exemption for the majority of our debit transactions 

the implementation of the doddfrank act is ongoing and as a result its overall impact remains unclear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that it is possible that we could be further directly or indirectly impacted

state usury laws 

extensions of credit under many of our card products may be treated as commercial loans in some states usury laws limit the interest rates that can be charged not only on consumer loans but on commercial loans as well to the extent that these usury laws apply we are limited in the amount of interest that we can charge and collect from our customers because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions we utilize choice of law provisions in our cardholder agreements as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply in addition the interest rates on certain of our card products are set based upon the usury limit of the cardholder’s state with respect to card products where we work with a partner or issuing bank the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and “exports” the usury limit of that state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2014 approximately 17 of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 17 of our consolidated revenue in 2014 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not credit worthy or are fraudulently completed changes in our industry customer demand and in relation to our fleet customers movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result could lead to increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments we derived approximately 66 of our consolidated revenues from these fees and charges during the year ended december 31 2014 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity the extent to which their use of optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer in the fleet card business our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers in the commercial payments business we face a variety of competitors some of which have greater financial resources name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies among others competitors in the mobile telematics business include the major car companies wireless phone service providers and independent services companies among others we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of food fuel toll transportation and fleet cards and vouchers commercial fleet cards offered by the major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value 

 

these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers such as treasury management commercial lending and credit card processing by providing these other services that we do not provide these competitors have an advantage of being able to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships sometimes at a discount for example in the commercial payments business we compete with full service banks that are able to offer treasury management and commercial lending in addition to commercial payment solutions if price competition continues to intensify we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers decrease the prices of our products and services or lose customers each of which could adversely affect our operating results in the fleet card business major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as well as offer add on complementary services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” during 2014 our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for approximately 9 of our consolidated revenue our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from about one to six years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected also our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be 

 

willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win this business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base in the closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel maintenance services and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected 

with respect to the closedloop networks we utilize a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers as well as from our new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants and service garages typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a yeartoyear basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other business related products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the united states and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the united states europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other business related products and services by our customers the commercial payments industry in general and our commercial payment solutions business specifically depends heavily upon the overall level of spending unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession or other changes may lead our corporate customers to reduce their spending resulting in reduced demand for or use of our products and services in addition unfavorable changes in economic conditions may lead our fleet card customers to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services as a result a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states or abroad could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase a weakening economy could also force some retailers and merchants to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and transaction declines in addition demand for fuel and other business related products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration of the ongoing sluggish economic conditions in the united states europe russia latin america australia and new zealand as a result continued weakness in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example within the past five years we have entered into the corporate payments stored value card vehicle maintenance management and telematics business in the united states and europe and transaction processing fuel food toll and transportation card and voucher businesses in brazil and mexico we may continue to enter new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis 

the products we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions all at high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any performance issue that arises with a new product service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we may rely on third parties to develop or codevelop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms or at all and these relationships may not be successful in addition partners some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties even if we are successful in developing new services and technologies these new services and technologies may not achieve broad acceptance due to a variety of factors including a lack of industrywide standards competing products and services or resistance to these changes from our customers in addition we may not be able to derive revenue from these efforts 

if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2014 we had approximately 359 billion of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew every three years 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a three year term although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually in the past there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us for example the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility during the financial crisis that began in 2008 

also a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest 

 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 44 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily czech koruna russian ruble british pound brazilian real mexican peso australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer in the united states and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible 

 

debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the united states 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in australia austria azerbaijan belarus belgium botswana brazil canada the czech republic estonia france georgia germany hong kong ireland kazakhstan latvia lithuania luxembourg macau malaysia mexico moldova mongolia morocco the netherlands new zealand papua new guinea philippines poland portugal russia slovakia spain south africa sweden united arab emirates the united kingdom and ukraine we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate specifically russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the united states for example russia and the ukraine are experiencing significant unrest which could escalate into broader armed conflict and additional economic sanctions by the us united nations or other countries against russia in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the united states these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the united states we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems telecommunications data centers and call centers including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to provide reliable service to customers cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data center and call centers as well as third party labor and services providers our business involves processing large numbers of transactions the movement of large sums of money and management of large amounts of data we rely on the ability of our employees contractors suppliers systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure uninterrupted and errorfree manner 

our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors such as power availability telecommunications carrier redundancy embargos and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries

we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data however there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown security breach or catastrophic event such as fire explosion flood pandemic natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure or physical breakin we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but in any event these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our products and services are based on proprietary and thirdparty network technology and processing systems that may encounter development delays and could be susceptible to undetected errors viruses or defects development delays system errors viruses or defects that result in service interruption or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation and subject us to thirdparty liability in addition errors viruses and defects in our network technology and processing systems could result in additional development costs and the diversion of our technical and other resources from other development efforts or operations further our attempts to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our agreements may not be successful 

 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers we do not maintain any insurance to protect us against any such losses 

criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft a single significant incident of fraud or increases in the overall level of fraud involving our cards and other products and services could result in reputational damage to us which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions including significant monetary fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately protect the data we collect which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information social security numbers expense data and credit card debit card and checking account numbers we keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

in addition under payment network rules regulatory requirements and related obligations we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties such as third party service providers vendors partners and others which we refer to collectively as associated participants the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the market for our commercial payment fleet and stored value card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers if businesses do not continue to use or increase their use of credit debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we believe that future growth in the use of credit debit and stored value cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of services offered in order for us to 

 

consistently increase and maintain profitability businesses must continue to use and increase the use of electronic payment methods including credit debit and stored value cards moreover if there is an adverse development in the payments industry in general such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business or a wellpublicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally 

furthermore new technologies may displace credit debit andor stored value cards as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses a decline in the acceptance and use of credit debit andor stored value cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards food vouchers and cards transportation and toll road payments telematics solutions and fleet maintenance management services is also evolving and those portions of our business are subject to similar risks 

if we fail to retain any of our stored value gift card customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all which will reduce our revenue 

most of our stored value gift card customers in the united states are national retailers during 2014 a majority of our gift card revenue was derived from the design and purchase of gift card inventory with the remaining portion of our 2014 gift card revenue derived primarily from processing fees if we fail to retain any of these customers it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all because there is a limited number of national retailers in the united states and nearly all of those other national retailers already have a gift card solution in place either inhouse or with one of our competitors as such any loss of a stored value gift card customer would reduce our revenue 

adverse weather conditions across a geographic region can cause a decline in the number and amount of payment transactions we process which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

when travel is severely curtailed across a geographic region during adverse weather conditions the number and amount of transactions we process can be significantly diminished particularly in our fleet business and revenue can materially decline for example during parts of january 2014 severe winter weather shut down a large portion of the eastern united states prolonged adverse weather events especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our gift card business results are subject to seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income 

our gift card business has experienced in the past and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns historically gift card business revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season 

 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 72 of our total assets at december 31 2014 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual 

 

property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

finally we use open source software in connection with our technology and services companies that incorporate open source software into their products have from time to time faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software as a result we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software open source software is also provided without warranty and may therefore include bugs security vulnerabilities or other defects some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software andor make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost while we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related technology or service such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the united states and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

 

for example certain of our subsidiaries are currently licensed as money transmitters on the state level by the banking departments or other state agencies of numerous states continued licensing by these states is subject to periodic examinations and ongoing satisfaction of compliance requirements regarding safety and soundness including maintenance of certain levels of net worth surety bonding permissible investments in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding payment obligations with respect to certain of our products subject to licensure and record keeping and reporting if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain maintain or renew necessary licenses or comply with other relevant state regulations they will not be able to operate as a money transmitter in those states or provide certain other services and products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the financial crimes enforcement network or fincen and must comply with applicable antimoney laundering requirements including implementation of an effective antimony laundering program changes in this regulatory environment including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business 

regulatory changes may also restrict or eliminate present and future business opportunities available to certain of our subsidiaries for example the durbin amendment to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 which serves to limit interchange fees may restrict or otherwise impact the way our subsidiaries do business or limit their ability to charge certain fees to customers the cfpb is also engaged in rule making and regulation of the payments industry in particular with respect to prepaid cards the cfpb’s focus on the protection of consumers might also extend to many of our small business customers as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb in connection with certain of our products and services cfpb rules examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs changing regulations or standards in the area of privacy and data protection could also adversely impact us in addition certain of our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authority and as a result could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us 

our business is subject to us federal antimoney laundering laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 which we refer to collectively as the bsa our business in canada is also subject to proceeds of crime money laundering and terrorist financing act or the pctfa which is a corollary to the bsa the bsa among other things requires money services businesses such as money transmitters issuers of money orders and official checks and providers of prepaid access to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records the pctfa imposes similar requirements 

many of these laws and regulations are evolving unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly with increasing frequency federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training monitoring and compliance including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and appropriate manner we may be subject to injunctions other sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties and our reputation may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

 

in addition we have endeavored to structure our businesses in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions payroll taxes and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws their interpretations or their enforcement could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to consumer information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services 

governmental bodies in the united states and abroad have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations restricting the transfer of and requiring safeguarding of nonpublic personal information for example in the united states all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to ensure the privacy and security of consumer financial information in connection with providing services to our clients we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks our sponsor bank and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer information these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as payment card industry or pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of nonpublic consumer personal information received from our customers our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future if we fail to comply with these regulations we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings in addition our client relationships and reputation could be harmed and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level our compliance costs may increase our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our acquisition documents include warranties covenants and conditions regarding various tax matters that occurred prior to the acquisition supported by indemnification and in some cases holdbacks or escrows from the sellers the obligations of the sellers are also generally subject to various limitations in the event of a tax claim related to a preacquisition tax year we would seek to recover costs and losses from the sellers under the acquisition agreement however there is no assurance that any indemnification holdback or escrow would be sufficient or that we would recover such costs or losses which could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results 

 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in increased expenses 

we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our current and past operations including employmentrelated disputes contract disputes intellectual property disputes government audits and proceedings customer disputes and tort claims responding to such claims may be difficult and expensive and we may not prevail in some proceedings the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief which if granted would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings regardless of whether we prevail or not such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have had inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business such inquiries may result in various audits reviews and investigations which can be time consuming and expensive an adverse outcome of any investigation by or other inquiries from such bodies or agencies could have a material adverse effect on us and result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties changes in personnel and increased review and scrutiny by customers regulatory authorities the media and others which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information about our judicial and other proceedings see “business—legal proceedings” 

our revenues from mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of mastercard it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations through our financial institution sponsors 

a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the united states and canada registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member bank either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive even if we pursue 

 

sponsorship by alternative member banks similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist  in addition mastercard routinely updates and modifies its requirements changes in the requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services if we do not comply with mastercard requirements it could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registration which allows us to process transactions on its networks the termination of our registration or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers which would have a material adverse effect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network card transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and the uk bribery act the fcpa prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock and us these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

executive overview 

segments 

we operate in two segments which we refer to as our north america and international segments the results from our shell germany business acquired during the third quarter of 2014 are reported in our international segment the results from our pacific pride business acquired in the second quarter of 2014 and comdata business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 are included within our north america segment see “results of operations” for additional segment information 

our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue” for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 our north america and international segments generated the following revenue 

 

 sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions and the related revenue per transaction as illustrated in the diagram below a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners for whom we manage card programs members of our proprietary networks who are provided access to our products and services and commercial businesses to whom we provide workforce payment productivity solutions revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as our customers and partners through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel cards corporate cards virtual cards purchasing cards te cards gift cards store value payroll cards vehicle maintenance food fuel toll and transportation cards and vouchers or lodging services to our customers 

 

the following diagram illustrates a typical card transaction flow but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance lodging and food fuel toll and transportation card and voucher products substituting transactions for gallons this representative model may not include all of our businesses 

illustrative transaction flow 

 

from our customers and partners we derive revenue from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and charges which can be fixed fees cost plus a markup or based on a percentage discount from retail prices our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue mostly from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses as illustrated in the table below the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of the product plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit 

the following table presents an illustrative revenue model for transactions with the merchant which is primarily applicable to fuel based product transactions but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance lodging and food fuel toll and transportation card and voucher products substituting transactions for gallons this representative model may not include all of our businesses

set forth below are our sources of revenue for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues 

 

  

 revenue per transaction set forth below is revenue per transaction information for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

  

  revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and the overall macroeconomic environment including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases as macroeconomic factors changes and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates see “results of operations” for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction 

from 2013 to 2014 total transactions increased from 3275 million to 6524 million an increase of 3249 million or 992 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america and international segments primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2014 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 in 2014 transaction volume was primarily affected by the inclusion of approximately 270 million transactions related to our svs product which is part of the comdata business acquired in november 2014 

 

from 2012 to 2013 total transactions increased from 3038 million to 3275 million an increase of 237 million or 78 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america and international segments primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2013 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 

revenue per transaction in our international segment has historically run higher than in our north america segment included in revenue per transactions is the impact of recent acquisitions revenue per transaction on a consolidated basis has been significantly impacted by acquisitions in our international segment from 2012 through 2014 furthermore as previously discussed revenue per transaction in our north america segment has been significantly impacted by our acquisition the svs product which is part of our comdata business acquired in november 2014 

in 2012 we acquired a russian fuel card business and ctf technologies inc ctf both in our international segment which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses in 2013 we acquired several businesses in our international segment fleetcard in australia cardlink in new zealand vb servicos vb and db trans sa db in brazil and epyx in the uk certain of these international acquisitions have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other international businesses which when combined with the impact of 2012 acquisitions contributes to the increase in transaction volumes and revenue per transaction in our international segment in 2013 over 2012 

we also acquired nextraq in the us in 2013 which has a higher revenue per transaction product in comparison to our other north america businesses this contributed to higher transaction volumes and revenue per transaction in our north america segment in 2013 over 2012 in addition to organic growth 

in 2014 we acquired comdata in the us which has a higher revenue per transaction product in comparison to our other north american business when excluding the impact of svs a part of the comdata business the svs product carries a very high volume of transactions at a very low revenue per transaction for discussion of revenue per transactions we are going to exclude the impact of the svs product which had approximately 270 million transactions in 2014 at a very low revenue per transaction 

sources of expenses 

we incur expenses in the following categories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 adjusted revenues adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share set forth below are adjusted revenues adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization other expense net equity method investment loss and loss on extinguishment of debt adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and diluted adjusted net income per share for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

 we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate thus we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis we use adjusted ebitda calculated as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization other expense net equity method investment loss and loss on extinguishment of debt to eliminate the impact of certain noncore items during the period we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental nongaap financial measures of operating performance see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures” 

 

factors and trends impacting our business 

we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

acquisitions and investments 

during 2014 we completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of 367 billion net of cash acquired of 1658 million

during 2013 we completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of 8393 million net of cash acquired of 356 million including deferred payments of 368 million and the estimated fair value of contingent consideration payments of 831 million during 2014 we recorded adjustments to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration of 281 million based on actual results of the business which included the impact of an unfavorable tax judgment against vb during the fourth quarter of 2014the most significant acquisitions are described below

revenues and revenue per transaction 

our consolidated revenue increased from 8952 million in 2013 to 11994 million in 2014 an increase of 3042 million or 340 the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 consolidated revenue per transaction decreased from 273 in 2013 to 184 in 2014 a decrease of 089 per transaction or 327 consolidated revenue per transaction includes the impact of the svs product which is part of our comdata business acquired in november 2014 the svs product had approximately 270 million transactions during 2014 at a very low revenue per transaction consolidated revenue per transaction for 2014 excluding the svs product increased 133 to 310 from 273 in 2013 this increase is primarily a result of organic growth in certain of our payment programs and the full year impact in 2014 of acquisitions completed in 2013 as noted above as well as acquisitions completed in 2014 some of which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses the increase also was due to the impact of the macroeconomic environment specifically higher fuel spread margins in 2014 over 2013

on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions at december 31 2014 we had the ability to generate approximately 29 million of additional liquidity under our securitization facility at december 31 2014 we had approximately 387 million available under our credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and presentation 

revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as from customers and partners we recognize revenue on fees generated through services to commercial fleets commercial businesses major oil companies petroleum marketers and leasing companies and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following i we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the acceptability of the product ii we have no inventory risk do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the product or have any involvement in the product specifications iii we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for the product predominantly fuel and iv the amount we earn for our services is fixed within a limited range 

through our merchant and network relationships we provide fuel prepaid cards vehicle maintenance lodging food toll and transportation related services to our customers we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction our net revenue consists of margin on sales and fees for technical support processing communications and reporting the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of the product plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as expense when the fuel purchase transaction is executed we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships when persuasive evidence of an 

 

arrangement exists the services have been provided to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we have entered into agreements with major oil companies petroleum marketers and leasing companies among others that specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records 

we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees report fees and other transactionbased fees which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed number of transactions processed or some combination thereof such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of thirdparty networks transaction fees and other transactionbased fees generated from our proprietary networks and thirdparty networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured card fees network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations in addition we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed and service are provided 

we also charge our customers transaction fees to load value onto prepaid fuel food toll and transportation vouchers and cards we recognize fee revenue upon providing the activated fuel food toll and transportation vouchers and prepaid cards to the customer revenue is recognized from the processing arrangements with merchants when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the services have been provided the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue is recognized on lodging and transportation management services when the lodging stay or transportation service is completed revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment in certain of our businesses which is recognized at the time the device is sold and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in revenues net within the consolidated statements of income the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within processing expenses we have recorded 151 million of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income in 2014 

our fiscal year ends on december 31 in certain of our uk businesses we record the operating results using a 445 week accounting cycle with the fiscal year ending on the friday on or immediately preceding december 31 fiscal years 2014 and 2012 include 52 weeks for the businesses reporting using a 445 accounting cycle fiscal year 2013 included 53 weeks for business reporting using a 445 accounting cycle 

we deliver both stored value cards and cardbased services primarily in the form of gift cards for multipledeliverable customer contracts stored value cards and cardbased services are separated into two units of accounting store valued cards are generally recognized upon shipment to the customer cardbased services are recognized when the card services are rendered 

a ccounts receivable 

as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a 12 billion revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a evolving basis to fleetcor funding llc funding a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary conduit in turn funding sells without recourse on a revolving basis up to 12 billion of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit funding maintains a subordinated interest in the form of over collateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper 

we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature 

 

on november 14 2014 in order to finance a portion of the comdata acquisition the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new receivables purchase agreement under the terms of the new receivables purchase agreement the purchase limit was increased from 500 million to 12 billion the term of the facility was extended to november 14 2017 

all foreign receivables are owned receivables and are not included in our receivable securitization program at december 31 2014 and 2013 there was 675 million and 349 million respectively of shortterm debt outstanding under our securitization facility 

credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables 

we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers payments from customers are generally due within 14 days of billing we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible and removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency recoveries from the thirdparty collection agency are not significant 

impairment of longlived assets and intangibles 

we test our other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with management’s intended actions if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows we determine the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally we perform our testing of the asset group at the businessline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

we complete an asset impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and the impairment test consists of two steps as well as a qualitative assessment as appropriate as deemed appropriate we have performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step 1 test from the prior year updated with current year results weightedaverage cost of capital rates and future projections 

 

we completed step 1 of the goodwill impairment testing for certain of our reporting units for which the qualitative assessment was not performed in this first step the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangibles as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using an estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate 

preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions significant changes in forecasts the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 

based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively and qualitatively on october 1 2014 we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible on a quarterly basis we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with authoritative literature we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

current guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained 

business combinations 

we have accounted for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income for significant acquisitions we obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction 

estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and is remeasured each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income we estimate the fair value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration using various valuation approaches as well as significant unobservable inputs reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 

stockbased compensation 

we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions or a combination of these shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years the fair value of restricted stock shares based on performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock shares based on market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo option pricing model the riskfree interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo option pricing model are calculated consistently with those applied in the blackscholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards 

for performancebased restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

adoption of new accounting standards 

foreign currency 

in march 2013 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201305 “parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity” which indicates that the entire amount of a cumulative translation adjustment “cta” related to an entity’s investment in a foreign entity should be released when there has been a sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity ie the foreign entity is deconsolidated or step acquisition for a foreign entity ie when an entity has changed from applying the equity method for an investment in a foreign entity to consolidating the foreign entity the asu does not change the requirement to release a pro rata portion of the cta of the foreign entity into earnings for a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity this asu is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2013 the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

unrecognized tax benefit when an nol exists 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 “presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” which indicates that to the extent a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets this asu is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2013 the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

 

going concern 

in august 2013 the fasb issued asu 201415 “disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” which requires entities to perform interim and annual assessments of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity’s financial statements this asu is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2016 and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations financial condition or cash flows as it is disclosure based 

discontinued operations reporting 

in april 2014 the fasb issued an asu 201408 “discounted operations reporting” that changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations this update will have the impact of reducing the frequency of disposals reported as discontinued operations by requiring such a disposal to represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results this update also expands the disclosures for discontinued operations and requires new disclosures related to individually significant disposals that do not qualify as discontinued operations this new guidance becomes effective for us prospectively in the first quarter of 2015 this amended guidance will only have a potential impact to the extent that we discontinue any operations in future periods 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” which amends the guidance in former asc 605 revenue recognition this amended guidance requires revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods and services when the performance obligation has been satisfied this amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and related cash flows arising from contracts with customers this asu is effective for us for fiscal years ending after december 15 2016 and interim periods with early adoption not permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of asc 606 

stockbased payment awards with performance targets 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu 201412 “sharebased payment awards with performance targets that are attainable after the requisite service period” for companies that grant their employees sharebased payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period this new guidance becomes effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2015 but early adoption is permitted this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

the table below summarizes the estimated dollar amounts of payments under contractual obligations identified below as of december 31 2014 for the periods specified 

 

  

 

  management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion under the caption “adjusted revenues adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share” above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap we have also included in the discussion under the caption “transaction volume and revenue per transaction” above a financial measure that was not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

adjusted revenues 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted revenues as revenues net less merchant commissions as reflected in our income statement 

we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in thousands 

 

  

adjusted ebitda 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted ebitda as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a interest expense b tax expense c depreciation of longlived assets d amortization of intangible assets e other expense income net f equity method investment loss and g loss on extinguishment of debt 

we use adjusted ebitda as a basis to evaluate our operating performance net of the impact of certain noncore items during the period we believe that adjusted ebitda may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income in thousands 

 

 adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stock based compensation expense related sharebased compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs and intangible assets c amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables d amortization of intangibles at our equity method investment e loss on extinguishment of debt and f other noncash adjustments 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income we believe that the effect of fair value adjustments resulting from acquisitions is not a key measure of our core operating performance we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

 

  

   

item 7a quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 443 485 and 434 of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2014 were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2014 by approximately 278 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 by approximately 200 million and 128 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt we invest our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes under our 3355 billion credit facility we have syndicated 202 billion and 300 million term loan agreements with a syndicate of term loan a and term loan b investors in the united states respectively as well as a revolving a credit facility of 10 billion and a revolving b credit facility of 35 million interest on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at our election at the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or at our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100 plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 

prior to entering into our new credit agreement we had borrowings outstanding under the existing credit facility on november 14 2014 proceeds from our new credit agreement were used to retire our existing indebtedness under the existing credit facility 

under our previously existing credit facility we had a syndicated 550 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of term loan b investors in the united states as well as a 850 million revolving credit facility interest on amounts outstanding under the previously existing credit agreement bore interest at our election at the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or at our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100 plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 

based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense would have changed by 29 million 16 million and 13 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreement these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 443 485 and 434 of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2014 were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2014 by approximately 278 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 by approximately 200 million and 128 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt we invest our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes under our 3355 billion credit facility we have syndicated 202 billion and 300 million term loan agreements with a syndicate of term loan a and term loan b investors in the united states respectively as well as a revolving a credit facility of 10 billion and a revolving b credit facility of 35 million interest on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at our election at the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or at our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100 plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 

prior to entering into our new credit agreement we had borrowings outstanding under the existing credit facility on november 14 2014 proceeds from our new credit agreement were used to retire our existing indebtedness under the existing credit facility 

under our previously existing credit facility we had a syndicated 550 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of term loan b investors in the united states as well as a 850 million revolving credit facility interest on amounts outstanding under the previously existing credit agreement bore interest at our election at the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or at our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100 plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 

based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense would have changed by 29 million 16 million and 13 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreement these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price 

 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2014 management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2014 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework as of december 31 2014 management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

in connection with management’s evaluation our management team excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 the internal controls relating to six subsidiaries that we acquired during the year ended december 31 2014 and for which financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements 

on november 14 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of comdata inc a provider of electronic payment solutions in the us we also acquired two other insignificant businesses during 2014 collectively we refer to these transactions as the acquisitions these acquisitions constituted 48 billion of total assets at december 31 2014 77 million of revenues and a net loss of 20 million respectively for the year then ended this exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements 

 

may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 competition 

we face considerable competition in our business the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service and account management and price we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors however we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to each of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

we compete with independent fleet card providers providers of card and employee benefit outsourcing services and major financial services companies as well as major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards we also compete with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house accounts as well as other forms of credit our primary independent fleet card and workforce productivity solutions competitors are wex inc comdata corporation and us bank voyager fleet systems inc in north america and wex inc edenred sodexo inc alelo ebbondacs and fleet on demand internationally

acquisitions 

for a discussion of recent acquisitions see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations—acquisitions” 

regulatory 

a substantial number of laws and regulations both in the united states and in other jurisdictions apply to businesses offering payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts in the united states these laws apply primarily to consumer cards which are cards used to make purchases for personal family or household purposes because our payment cards are limited to purchases for business purposes only they are typically classified as commercial cards and are generally not subject to many of the laws and regulations applicable to consumer cards as a result our business is less regulated than one that provides products or services to consumers yet we are still subject to significant domestic and foreign regulation 

the following while not exhaustive is a description of several federal and state laws and regulations in the united states that are applicable to our business the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions also affect us and they may be more or less restrictive than those in the united states and may also impact different parts of our operations in addition the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing revision and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us 

federal trade commission act 

the federal trade commission act empowers the federal trade commission or ftc to regulate unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce while this power is generally exercised to protect consumers the ftc has sometimes taken action on behalf of small businesses a number of state laws and regulations also prohibit unfair and deceptive business practices 

truth in lending act 

the truth in lending act or tila was enacted to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and is implemented by regulation z most provisions of tila and regulation z apply only to the extension of consumer credit but a limited number apply to commercial cards as well one example where tila and regulation z are generally applicable is a limitation on liability for unauthorized use although a business that acquires 10 or more credit cards for its personnel can agree to more expansive liability our cardholder agreements generally provide for these business customers to waive to the fullest extent possible all limitations on liability for unauthorized card use 

credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 

the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 amended provisions of tila that affect consumer credit and also directed the federal reserve board to study the use of credit cards by small businesses and to make legislative recommendations the report concluded that it is not clear whether the potential benefits outweigh the increased cost and reduced credit availability if the disclosure and substantive restrictions applicable to consumer cards were to be applied to small business cards legislation has been introduced from time to time to increase the protections afforded to small businesses that use payment cards if legislation of this kind were enacted our products and services for small businesses could be adversely impacted 

equal credit opportunity act 

the equal credit opportunity act or ecoa together with regulation b prohibit creditors from discriminating on certain prohibited bases such as an applicant’s sex race nationality age and marital status and further 

 

requires that creditors disclose the reasons for taking any adverse action against an applicant or a customer seeking credit 

the fair credit reporting act 

the fair credit reporting act or fcra regulates consumer reporting agencies and the disclosure and use of consumer reports we may obtain consumer reports with respect to an individual who guarantees or otherwise is obligated on a commercial card 

fact act 

the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 amended fcra and requires creditors to adopt identity theft prevention programs to detect prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with covered accounts which can include business accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft 

bank secrecy act 

the currency and foreign transactions reporting act which is also known as the bank secrecy act and which has been amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 contains a variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering among other things the bank secrecy act and implementing regulations issued by the us treasury department require financialservices providers to establish antimoney laundering programs to report suspicious activity and to maintain a number of related records we maintain antimoney laundering controls designed to prevent our network from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit the implementation of the doddfrank act is ongoing and as a result its overall impact remains unclear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that even though our industry was not targeted it is possible that we could be directly or indirectly impacted for example a provision of the law requires credit card issuers to collect and report information regarding applications made by women and minority owned businesses and small businesses we continue to prepare for this requirement but proposed regulations have not been published 

payment card industry rules 

partner banks issuing payment cards bearing the mastercard brand and fleetcor to the extent that we provide certain services in connection with those cards and fleet customers acting as merchants accepting those cards must comply with the bylaws regulations and requirements that are promulgated by mastercard and other applicable paymentcard organizations including the payment card industry data security standard developed by mastercard and visa the mastercard site data protection program and other applicable datasecurity program requirements 

state usury laws 

extensions of credit under many of our card products may be treated as commercial loans in some states usury laws limit the interest rates that can be charged not only on consumer loans but on commercial loans as well to the extent that these usury laws apply we are limited in the amount of interest that we can charge and collect from our customers because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions we utilize choice of law 

 

provisions in our cardholder agreements as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply in addition the interest rates on certain of our card products are set based upon the usury limit of the cardholder’s state with respect to card products where we work with a partner or issuing bank the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and “exports” the usury limit of that state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions 

other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing privacy data security and breach notification we are also subject to debtcollection laws and to bankruptcy and other debtorrelief laws that can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us 

employees and labor relations 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 3500 employees approximately 900 of whom were located in the united states we consider our employee relations to be good and have never experienced a work stoppage

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2013 approximately 20 of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 16 of our consolidated revenue in 2013 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers many of which are small to midsized businesses we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are fraudulently completed changes in our industry and movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports optional services and late payments we derived approximately 65 of our consolidated revenues from these fees and charges during the year ended december 31 2013 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity the extent to which their use of optional services or pay invoices late our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies among others competitors in the mobile telematics business include the major car companies wireless phone service providers and independent services companies among others we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of food fuel toll transportation and fleet cards and vouchers commercial fleet cards offered by the major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features 

 

networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions for example major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as well as offer add on complementary services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” during 2013 our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for approximately 13 of our consolidated revenue our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from two to seven years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected also our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors including pricing the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win this business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel maintenance services and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our business may be adversely affected 

with respect to the closedloop networks we utilize a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers as well as from our new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants and service garages typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a yeartoyear basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the united states and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of fuel purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the united states europe russia latin america australia and new zealand and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other vehicle products and services by businesses unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession or other changes may lead our customers which are largely comprised of commercial fleets to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services these declines could result from among other things reduced fleet traffic corporate purchasing travel and other commercial activities from which we derive revenue 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase in addition demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration of the ongoing sluggish economic conditions in the united states europe russia latin america australia and new zealand as a result continued weakness in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example within the past five years we have entered into the telematics business in the united states and europe transaction processing fuel food toll and transportation card and voucher businesses in brazil and mexico and the lodging card business in 

 

the united states we may continue to enter new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology the marketplace or major oil partner requirements or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2013 we had approximately 15 billion of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew on an annual basis 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a one year term although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us for example the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility during the financial crisis that began in 2008 

also a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 49 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily czech koruna russian ruble british pound brazilian real mexican peso australian dollar and new zealand dollar revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer in the united states and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets may include substantial contingent earnout payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the united states 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in australia azerbaijan belarus belgium benin botswana brazil cameroun canada the czech republic estonia france gabon georgia ghana hong kong ireland kazakhstan kenya latvia lithuania luxembourg macau malawi malaysia mexico moldova the netherlands new zealand papua new guinea peru philippines portugal republic of cyprus russia singapore slovakia south africa tanzania united arab emirates the united kingdom zambia and zimbabwe we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate specifically russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the united states for example russia and the ukraine are experiencing significant unrest which could escalate into armed conflict and economic sanctions by the us united nations or other countries against russia in addition changes in laws or regulations including with respect to payment service providers taxation information technology data transmission and the internet or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the united states these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the united states we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to process and authorize transactions electronically depends on our ability to communicate electronically through pointofsale devices and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties in addition in order to process transactions promptly our computer equipment and network servers must be functional 24 hours a day which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by thirdparties and the availability of electricity which we do not control a severe disruption of one or more of these networks 

 

including as a result of utility or thirdparty system interruptions could impair our ability to authorize transactions and process information which could harm our reputation result in a loss of customers or partners and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we also utilize thirdparty providers to assist us with business continuity and disaster recovery operations as a result we are subject to the risk of a provider’s unresponsiveness in the event of a significant breakdown in our computer equipment or networks furthermore our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our products and services are based on proprietary and thirdparty network technology and processing systems that may encounter development delays and could be susceptible to undetected errors viruses or defects development delays system errors viruses or defects that result in service interruption or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation and subject us to thirdparty liability in addition errors viruses and defects in our network technology and processing systems could result in additional development costs and the diversion of our technical and other resources from other development efforts or operations further our attempts to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our agreements may not be successful 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers we do not maintain any insurance to protect us against any such losses 

we may not be able to adequately protect the data we collect which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants including bank account information and expense data we keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the market for fleet card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally 

 

furthermore new technologies may displace fleet cards as payment mechanisms for fuel purchase transactions a decline in the acceptance and use of fleet cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards food vouchers and cards transportation and toll road payments telematics solutions and fleet maintenance management services is also evolving and those portions of our business are subject to similar risks 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 61 of our total assets at december 31 2013 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties could claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new 

 

products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the united states and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business customers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

 

in addition we have endeavored to structure our businesses in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions payroll taxes and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws their interpretations or their enforcement could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our acquisition documents include warranties covenants and conditions regarding various tax matters that occurred prior to the acquisition supported by indemnification and in some cases holdbacks or escrows from the sellers the obligations of the sellers are also generally subject to various limitations in the event of a tax claim related to a preacquisition tax year we would seek to recover costs and losses from the sellers under the acquisition agreement however there is no assurance that any indemnification holdback or escrow would be sufficient or that we would recover such costs or losses which could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in increased expenses 

from time to time we may be subject to legal action arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise any such action could result in expenses which if uninsured could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows 

we rely on third parties for card issuing and processing services supporting our mastercard network fleet card products failure to maintain these contractual relationships upon acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card offerings customer retention and operating results 

some of our fleetcard products in north america are accepted in the mastercard merchant network pursuant to our contractual relationships with issuing banks and thirdparty processors in order to continue offering fleet cards accepted at mastercard network merchants we must maintain our contractual relationship with at least one issuing bank further unless we develop our own mastercardapproved processing capabilities we must continue to obtain processing services from at least one processor approved by mastercard with the capability to provide acceptable levels of reporting data for fleet operators our failure to maintain adequate relationships or find suitable alternatives could have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card products our customer retention and our operating results 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded fleet cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network fleet cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network fleetcard transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us uk and other foreign regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and the uk bribery act the fcpa prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of 

 

obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and in the us suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition our certificate of incorporation prohibits large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or consolidating with us except under certain circumstances these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire

executive overview 

segments 

we operate in two segments which we refer to as our north america and international segments the results from our mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher business acquired during the third quarter of 2011 allstar business acquired during the fourth quarter of 2011 the russian fuel card business acquired during the second quarter of 2012 ctf technologies inc acquired during the third quarter of 2012 the australian fleet card business acquired during the first quarter of 2013 the new zealand cardlink business acquired during the second quarter of 2013 the brazilian vb business acquired during the third quarter of 2013 the brazilian db business acquired during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the uk epyx business acquired during the fourth quarter of 2013 are reported in our international segment the results from our nextraq business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013 are included within our north america segment see “results of operations” for additional segment information 

our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue” for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 our north america and international segments generated the following revenue 

 

 sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions and the related revenue per transaction as illustrated in the diagram below a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners for whom we manage card programs members of our proprietary networks who are provided access to our products and services and commercial businesses to whom we provide workforce payment productivity solutions revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as our customers and partners through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel vehicle maintenance food fuel toll and transportation cards and vouchers or lodging services to our customers 

 

the following diagram illustrates a typical card transaction flow but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance lodging and food fuel toll and transportation card and voucher products substituting transactions for gallons this representative model may not include all of our businesses 

illustrative transaction flow 

 

from our customers and partners we derive revenue from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and charges which can be fixed fees cost plus a markup or based on a percentage discount from retail prices our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue mostly from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses as illustrated in the table below the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of the product plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit 

the following table presents an illustrative revenue model for transactions with the merchant which is primarily applicable to fuel based product transactions but may also be applied to our vehicle maintenance lodging and food fuel toll and transportation card and voucher products substituting transactions for gallons this representative model may not include all of our businesses

set forth below are our sources of revenue for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues 

 

  

 revenue per transaction set forth below is revenue per transaction information for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

 1 adjusted revenues is a nongaap financial measure defined as revenues net less merchant commissions we believe this measure is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs adjusted revenues is a supplemental nongaap financial measures of operating performance see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures” 

revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and the overall macroeconomic environment including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases as macroeconomic factors changes and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates see “results of operations” for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction 

from 2012 to 2013 total transactions increased from 3038 million to 3275 million an increase of 237 million or 78 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america and international segments primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2013 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 

from 2011 to 2012 total transactions increased from 2148 million to 3038 million an increase of 890 million or 414 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america and international segments primarily 

 

due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 

revenue per transaction in our international segment has historically run higher than in our north america segment included in revenue per transactions is the impact of recent acquisitions revenue per transaction on a consolidated basis has been significantly impacted by acquisitions in our international segment from 2011 through 2013 and to a lesser degree our north american acquisition in 2013 

in 2011 we acquired efectivale in mexico and allstar business solutions limited allstar in the uk both in our international segment while the acquired businesses represent good profit margin businesses they have lower revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses the impact of these acquisitions on revenue per transaction was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 in 2012 we acquired a russian fuel card business and ctf technologies inc ctf both in our international segment which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses in 2013 we acquired several businesses in our international segment fleetcard in australia cardlink in new zealand vb servicos vb and db trans sa db in brazil and epyx in the uk certain of these international acquisitions have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other international businesses which when combined with the impact of 2012 acquisitions contributes to the increase in transaction volumes and revenue per transaction in our international segment in 2013 over 2012 

we also acquired nextraq in the us in 2013 which has a higher revenue per transaction product in comparison to our other north american businesses this added to higher transaction volumes and revenue per transaction in our north american segment in 2013 over 2012 in addition to organic growth 

sources of expenses 

we incur expenses in the following categories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 adjusted revenues ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share set forth below are adjusted revenues earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda adjusted net income and diluted adjusted net income per share for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

 

 we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants that participate in certain of our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate thus we believe this is a more effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis we use ebitda calculated as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and other income to eliminate the impact of certain noncore items during the period we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental nongaap financial measures of operating performance see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures”

revenues and revenue per transaction 

our consolidated revenue increased from 7075 million in 2012 to 8952 million in 2013 an increase of 1877 million or 265 the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 consolidated revenue per transaction increased from 233 in 2012 to 273 in 2013 an increase of 040 per transaction or 173 this increase is primarily due to organic growth in certain of our payment programs and the full year impact in 2013 of acquisitions completed in 2012 as noted above as well as acquisitions completed in 2013 some of which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses total transactions increased from 3038 million to 3275 million an increase of 237 million or 78 

north america segment revenues and revenue per transaction 

north america revenue increased from 4001 million in 2012 to 4607 million in 2013 an increase of 606 million or 151 the increase in our north america revenue was primarily due to the following

international segment revenue 

international segment revenue increased from 3074 million in 2012 to 4345 million in 2013 an increase of 1271 million or 413 the increase in international segment revenue was due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

 international segment revenue per transaction increased from 209 in 2012 to 267 in 2013 an increase of 058 per transaction or 277 this increase is primarily due to organic growth in certain of our payment programs and the full period impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2013 some of which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses we experienced an increase in transactions in our international segment primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2013 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 

consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions increased from 586 million in 2012 to 682 million in 2013 an increase of 96 million or 163 this increase was primarily due to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel which impacted merchant commissions in certain card programs as well as the impact of higher volume in revenue streams where merchant commissions are paid primarily in our north america segment 

processing processing expenses increased from 1155 million in 2012 to 1340 million in 2013 an increase of 185 million or 161 our processing expenses primarily increased due to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2013 partially offset by efficiencies gained in certain of our more recently acquired businesses 

selling selling expenses increased from 464 million in 2012 to 574 million in 2013 an increase of 110 million or 235 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2013 as well as additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from 1101 million in 2012 to 1423 million in 2013 an increase of 322 million or 292 our general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2013 as well as approximately 60 million of additional onetime deal related costs and additional stock based compensation expense of 74 million 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 520 million in 2012 to 727 million in 2013 an increase of 207 million or 400 the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to acquisitions completed during 2012 and 2013 which resulted in an increase of 215 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets for customer and vendor relationships trade names and trademarks noncompete agreements and software as well as acquired fixed assets and development related to our gfn processing application 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 3249 million in 2012 to 4206 million in 2013 an increase of 957 million or 295 our operating margin increased from 459 in 2012 to 470 in 2013 the increase in operating income and operating margin is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed during 2012 and 2013 organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transactions as well as synergies gained in certain of our acquired businesses these positive drivers of consolidated results were partially offset by the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment primarily due to lower fuel prices and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates as well as onetime deal related expenses incurred during the year of approximately 60 million 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north america segment operating income 

north america operating income increased from 1967 million in 2012 to 2205 million in 2013 an increase of 238 million or 121 north america operating margin decreased from 491 in 2012 to 479 in 2013 the increase in operating income is due primarily to organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transaction and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013 the decrease in operating margin is due primarily to the impact of increased stock based compensation expense the majority of which is recorded in our north america segment as well as onetime deal related expenses incurred during the year of 60 million 

international segment operating income 

international operating income increased from 1282 million in 2012 to 2001 million in 2013 an increase of 719 million or 560 international operating margin increased from 417 in 2012 to 461 in 2013 the increase in operating income and operating margin is due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2013 organic growth in the business driven by increases in volume and revenue per transaction as well as synergies gained in certain of our acquired businesses the macroeconomic environment had a negative effect on international segment operating income primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower fuel prices 

other expense income net 

other expense net decreased from 11 million in 2012 to 06 million in 2013 a decrease of 05 million a negligible change 

interest expense net 

interest expense increased from 130 million in 2012 to 164 million in 2013 an increase of 34 million or 265 the increase is due to an increase in borrowings in 2013 over 2012 primarily due to funding the purchase 

 

price for acquisitions the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility to include our term loan domestic revolver a foreign revolver b and foreign swing line of credit as well as the relevant unused credit facility fees in 2013 and 2012 there were no borrowings under our foreign revolver b in 2012 

 

 provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 946 million in 2012 to 1191 million in 2013 an increase of 245 million or 259 our effective tax rate decreased from 304 in 2012 to 295 in 2013 discrete items and changes in the estimate of the annual tax rate are recorded in the period they occur included in income tax expense in both 2012 and 2013 is the impact of income tax benefits resulting from the enactment of a uk statutory tax rate reduction during the third quarter of each period this lower statutory rate was applied to deferred tax items which are primarily payable in future periods reducing income tax expense in 2012 and 2013 by approximately 33 million and 40 million respectively furthermore our effective tax rate in 2012 was negatively impacted by an increase in taxes of 19 million during the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the impact of the controlled foreign corporation lookthrough exclusion expiring for the company on december 1 2012 the exclusion was retroactively extended in january 2013 and the 19 million was reversed benefiting income tax expense in 2013 

we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in certain nonus taxing jurisdictions are lower than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates the lower tax rate in 2013 was also driven by a shift in the mix of earnings largely due to acquisitions to foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

net income 

for the reasons discussed above our net income increased from 2162 million in 2012 to 2845 million in 2013 an increase of 683 million or 316

 consolidated revenue per transaction decreased from 242 in 2011 to 233 in 2012 a decrease of 009 per transaction or 37 this decrease is primarily due to the full year impact in 2012 of acquisitions completed in 2011 as noted above that have products with lower overall revenue per transaction than our other businesses consolidated revenue per transaction was further impacted by the reasons discussed above total transactions increased from 2148 million to 3038 million an increase of 890 million or 414 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north america and international segments primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011

 international segment revenue per transaction decreased from 275 in 2011 to 209 in 2012 a decrease of 066 per transaction or 240 this decrease is primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 that have products with lower overall revenue per transaction than our other businesses international revenue per transaction was further impacted by the reasons discussed above 

consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions increased from 512 million in 2011 to 586 million in 2012 an increase of 74 million or 145 this increase was primarily due to the fluctuation in the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel which impacted merchant commissions in certain card programs and the impact of higher volume in revenues streams where merchant commissions are paid partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

processing processing expenses increased from 845 million in 2011 to 1155 million in 2012 an increase of 310 million or 367 during 2012 our processing expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 which have a higher rate of processing expenses as a percentage of revenues in comparison to our other businesses partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

selling selling expenses increased from 366 million in 2011 to 464 million in 2012 an increase of 98 million or 268 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 as well as additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from 848 million in 2011 to 1101 million in 2012 an increase of 253 million or 298 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 362 million in 2011 to 520 million in 2012 an increase of 158 million or 436 the increase was primarily due to additional amortization and depreciation from acquired intangible assets and fixed assets due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 which resulted in an increase of 149 million in 2012 over 2011 this increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 2263 million in 2011 to 3249 million in 2012 an increase of 986 million or 436 our operating margin was 436 and 459 for 2011 and 2012 respectively the increase in operating income and margin from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to organic growth in the business the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 and the positive effective of the macroeconomic environment including higher fuel prices higher fuel spread revenues partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

 

additionally during 2011 and 2012 we completed the acquisitions of a mexican business allstar ctf and a russian fuel card business which together contributed to the increase in consolidated operating income however the mexican business allstar business and ctf each produce lower margin products in comparison to our other businesses and when combined with our other businesses’ operating income produced a lower margin than would have resulted without the acquisitions 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north america segment operating income 

north america operating income increased from 1537 million in 2011 to 1967 million in 2012 an increase of 430 million or 280 north america operating margin was 441 and 491 for 2011 and 2012 respectively the increase in operating income from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to organic growth in the business and the impact of the positive macroeconomic environment including higher fuel prices and higher fuel spread revenues 

international segment operating income 

international operating income increased from 726 million in 2011 to 1282 million in 2012 an increase of 556 million or 766 international operating margin was 425 and 417 for 2011 and 2012 respectively the increase in operating income from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 organic growth in the business and the impact of the positive macroeconomic environment including slightly higher fuel prices and higher fuel spread margins partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates these increases were partially offset by additional amortization related to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 and onetime transaction related costs 

the lower operating margin was due to the acquisitions of our mexican business allstar business and ctf which each produce lower margin products in comparison to our other businesses 

other expense income net 

other expense income net increased from income of 06 million 2011 to expense of 11 million in 2012 an increase of 17 million the increase was due primarily to expenses related to our secondary stock offerings during the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2012 as well as foreign currency exchange gains recognized during 2011 

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased from 134 million in 2011 to 130 million in 2012 a decrease of 04 million or 30 the decrease is due primarily to lower average interest rates paid on debt instruments in 2012 over 2011 the reduction in our average interest rates is a result of the refinancing of the 2005 credit facility and ccs facility to a new us credit facility in june 2011 that carries a lower interest rate the reduction in rates is also due to the renewing of our accounts receivable securitization facility to a new 364 day term with a lower interest rate the average interest rate paid on borrowings on our domestic revolving line of credit term loans including the unused credit facility fee and foreign swing line of credit under our new credit facility was 199 200 and 203 respectively in 2012 the average interest rate paid on borrowings on our domestic line of credit and term loans including the unused credit facility fee on our new credit facility was 254 and 205 respectively in 2011 the average interest rate on the 2005 credit facility was 254 in 2011 the average interest rate on the ccs credit facility was 266 in 2011 

 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased from 27 million in 2011 to zero in 2012 this decrease is due to the writeoff of 17 million and 10 million in deferred debt issuance costs associated with the early extinguishment of the 2005 facility and ccs credit facility respectively upon retirement of these credit facilities with the proceeds from our new credit facility signed on june 22 2011 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 635 million in 2011 to 946 million in 2012 an increase of 311 million or 490 the increase from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to an increase in our income before income tax and an increase in our effective tax rate from 301 in 2011 to 304 in 2012 the increase in our effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in taxes of 19 million during the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the impact of the controlled foreign corporation lookthrough exclusion expiring for the company on december 1 2012 the exclusion was retroactively extended in january 2013 however on december 31 2012 the retroactive extension had not been passed see also “note 11income taxes” for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective tax rate

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness complete acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

sources of liquidity 

at december 31 2013 our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance totaled 3381 million our restricted cash balance at december 31 2013 totaled 482 million restricted cash primarily represents customer deposits in the czech republic which we are restricted from using other than to repay customer deposits and which may not be deposited outside of the czech republic 

at december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested is 2855 million all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries excluding restricted cash are available for general corporate purposes our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time we currently believe that funds generated from our us operations along with potential borrowing capabilities in the us will be sufficient to fund our us operations for the foreseeable future and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our us operations however if at a future date or time these funds are needed for our operations in the us or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds no assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof the tax consequences related thereto or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic fuel card receivables to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay 

 

merchants within seven days of receiving the merchant billing as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions at december 31 2013 we had the ability to generate approximately 33 million of additional liquidity under our securitization facility at december 31 2013 we had approximately 215 million available under our credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all

we test our other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets 

 

are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows we determine the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally we perform our testing of the asset group at the businessline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

we complete an asset impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and the impairment test consists of two steps as well as a qualitative assessment as appropriate we have performed a step 0 qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step 1 test from the prior year updated with current year results weightedaverage cost of capital rates and future projections 

we completed step 1 of the goodwill impairment testing for certain of our reporting units for which the qualitative assessment was not performed in this first step the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangibles as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using our estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate 

 

preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions significant changes in our forecasts the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 

based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively and qualitatively on october 1 2013 we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with relevant authoritative literature income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible on a quarterly basis we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with authoritative literature we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income taxes payable and income tax expense 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

current guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained 

business combinations 

we have accounted for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income for significant acquisitions we 

 

obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction 

these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include additional contingent consideration related to future earnouts based on the growth of the market contingent earnouts are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition and are remeasured each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income we estimate the fair value of the acquisitionrelated contingent consideration using various valuation approaches as well as significant unobservable inputs reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 

stockbased compensation 

we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant prior to july 2012 due to the limited time we had been public we estimated the volatility of the share price of our common stock by considering the historical volatility of the stock of similar public entities in determining the appropriateness of the public entities included in the volatility assumption we considered a number of factors including the entity’s life cycle stage size financial leverage and products offered beginning july 1 2012 we began utilizing the volatility of the share price of our common stock to estimate the volatility assumption for the blackscholes option pricing model stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting prior to our initial public offering the vesting of the shares granted in 2010 were contingent on the sale of our company or a public offering of our common stock subject to certain other conditions the vesting of the shares granted in 2010 and beyond are generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years the fair value of restricted stock shares based on performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock shares based on market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo option pricing model the riskfree interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo option pricing model are calculated consistently with those applied in the blackscholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards for performancebased restricted stock awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

 

adoption of new accounting standards 

qualitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles 

in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201202 “intangibles—goodwill and other” which gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired the proposed guidance is similar to asu 201108 for goodwill companies would consider relevant events and circumstances that may affect the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset a company that concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an asset exceeds its carrying amount would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset in the current year however if a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired it must calculate the fair value of the asset and compare that value with its carrying amount as is required by current guidance asu 201202 will be applied prospectively for annual and interim impairment tests performed asu 201202 was effective for and adopted by us beginning january 1 2013 our adoption of this asu did not affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 201302 “reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci” asu 201302 under asu 201302 an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of aoci by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts asu 201302 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements asu 201302 was effective for and adopted by us beginning january 1 2013 we have not reclassified any items out of aoci to the income statement during the year ended december 31 2013 

disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 

in december 2011 the fasb issued fasb asu 201111 “disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on an entity’s financial position the amendments require enhanced disclosures about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either i offset in accordance with current literature or ii subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with current literature asu 201111 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after january 1 2013 this standard became effective for us beginning october 2013 in january 2013 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201301 scope clarification of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities to limit the scope of the new balance sheet offsetting disclosure requirements to derivatives including bifurcated embedded derivatives repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions as we are not party to any derivatives repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements securities borrowing and lending transactions the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the presentation of or disclosures within our financial statements 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

 

foreign currency 

in march 2013 the fasb issued asu 201305 “parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity” which indicates that the entire amount of a cumulative translation adjustment “cta” related to an entity’s investment in a foreign entity should be released when there has been a sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity ie the foreign entity is deconsolidated or step acquisition for a foreign entity ie when an entity has changed from applying the equity method for an investment in a foreign entity to consolidating the foreign entity the asu does not change the requirement to release a pro rata portion of the cta of the foreign entity into earnings for a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity this asu is effective for us for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2013 our adoption of this asu is not expected to affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows unless transactions within the scope of the asu occur 

unrecognized tax benefit when an nol exists 

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 “presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists” which indicates that to the extent a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets this asu is effective us for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2013 our adoption of this asu is not expected to affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows unless transactions within the scope of the asu occur

 management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion under the caption “adjusted revenues ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share” above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap we have also included in the discussion under the caption “transaction volume and revenue per transaction” above a financial measure that was not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

adjusted revenues 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted revenues as revenues net less merchant commissions as reflected in our income statement 

we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in thousands 

 

 ebitda 

we have defined the nongaap measure ebitda as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a interest expense b tax expense c depreciation of longlived assets d amortization of intangible assets e other expense income net and f loss on extinguishment of debt 

we use ebitda as a basis to evaluate our operating performance net of the impact of certain noncore items during the period we believe that ebitda may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis ebitda is not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income in thousands 

 

 adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income adjusted to eliminate a noncash stock based compensation expense related sharebased compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs and intangible assets c amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables and d loss on extinguishment of debt 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our statement of income 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

 

  

item 7a quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 485 434 and 329 of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2013 were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated operating income during the year ended december 31 2013 by approximately 200 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated pretax income for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 by approximately 128 million and 73 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt we invest our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes under our credit facility we have a syndicated 550 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of term loan b investors in the united states as well as a 850 million revolving credit facility interest on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at our election at the british bankers association libor rate the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on a leverage ratio or at our option the base rate defined as the rate equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b the prime rate announced by bank of america na or c the eurocurrency rate plus 100 plus a margin based on a leverage ratio 

prior to entering into our credit facility we had borrowings outstanding under the 2005 credit facility and the ccs credit facility on june 22 2011 proceeds from our new credit facility were used to retire our existing indebtedness under the 2005 credit facility and the ccs credit facility 

under the 2005 credit facility we had a syndicated 3000 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of term loan b investors in the united states the term loan bore interest at our election at the prime rate or libor plus a margin based on our leverage position under the 2005 credit facility we also had a 50 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks based in the united states and europe borrowings bore a variable interest rate based at the prime rate or libor plus a margin that varied according to our leverage position 

in addition we had an 843 million term loan under our ccs credit facility this term loan bore interest on a base rate pribor plus a margin and mandatory cost 

based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our securitization facility at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points our interest expense would have changed by 16 million 13 million and 13 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreement these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price

not applicable 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2013 management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2013 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework as of december 31 2013 management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

in connection with management’s evaluation our management team excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 the internal controls relating to six subsidiaries that we acquired during the year ended december 31 2013 and for which financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements 

on march 25 2013 we acquired certain fuel card assets from ge capital australia’s custom fleet leasing business which we refer to as fleetcard on april 29 2013 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of cardlink a fuel card processor in new zealand on august 9 2013 we acquired all of the stock of vb servicos comercio e administracao ltda a brazilian provider of transportation cards and vouchers on october 1 2013 we acquired all of the stock of epyx a uk provider of fleet maintenance service and repair on october 15 2013 we acquired db trans sa a provider of payment solutions for independent truckers in brazil on october 17 2013 we acquired all of the stock of nextraq a us based provider of telematics solutions we also acquired three other insignificant businesses during 2013 collectively we refer to these transactions as the acquisitions these acquisitions constituted 32 of total assets and 23 of net assets respectively at december 31 2013 and 8 of revenues and 4 of net income respectively for the year then ended this exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls

we compete with independent fleet card providers providers of card outsourcing services and major financial services companies as well as major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards we also compete with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house accounts as well as other forms of credit our primary independent fleet card competitors are wright express corporation comdata corporation and us bank voyager fleet systems inc in north america and wright express corporation edenred and sodexo inc internationally

acquisitions 

for a discussion of recent acquisitions see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations—acquisitions” 

regulatory 

a substantial number of laws and regulations both in the united states and in other jurisdictions apply to businesses offering payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts in the united states these laws apply primarily to consumer cards which are cards used to make purchases for personal family or household purposes because our payment cards are limited to purchases for business purposes only they are typically classified as commercial cards and are generally not subject to many of the laws and regulations applicable to consumer cards as a result our business is less regulated than one that provides products or services to consumers yet we are still subject to significant domestic and foreign regulation 

the following while not exhaustive is a description of several federal and state laws and regulations in the united states that are applicable to our business the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions also affect us and they may be more or less restrictive than those in the united states and may also impact different parts of our operations in addition the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing revision and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us 

federal trade commission act 

the federal trade commission act empowers the federal trade commission or ftc to regulate unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce while this power is generally exercised to protect consumers the ftc has sometimes taken action on behalf of small businesses a number of state laws and regulations also prohibit unfair and deceptive business practices 

truth in lending act 

the truth in lending act or tila was enacted to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and is implemented by regulation z most provisions of tila and regulation z apply only to the extension of consumer credit but a limited number apply to commercial cards as well one example where tila and regulation z are generally applicable is a limitation on liability for unauthorized use although a business that acquires 10 or more credit cards for its personnel can agree to more expansive liability our cardholder agreements generally provide for these business customers to waive to the fullest extent possible all limitations on liability for unauthorized card use 

  

index to financial statements credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 

the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 amended provisions of tila that affect consumer credit and also directed the federal reserve board to study the use of credit cards by small businesses and to make legislative recommendations the report concluded that it is not clear whether the potential benefits outweigh the increased cost and reduced credit availability if the disclosure and substantive restrictions applicable to consumer cards were to be applied to small business cards legislation has been introduced to increase the protections afforded to small businesses that use payment cards if legislation of this kind were enacted our products and services for small businesses could be impacted 

equal credit opportunity act 

the equal credit opportunity act or ecoa together with regulation b prohibit creditors from discriminating on certain prohibited bases such as an applicant’s sex race nationality age and marital status and further requires that creditors disclose the reasons for taking any adverse action against an applicant or a customer seeking credit 

the fair credit reporting act 

the fair credit reporting act or fcra regulates consumer reporting agencies and the disclosure and use of consumer reports we may obtain consumer reports with respect to an individual who guarantees or otherwise is obligated on a commercial card 

fact act 

the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 amended fcra and requires creditors to adopt identity theft prevention programs to detect prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with covered accounts which can include business accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft 

bank secrecy act 

the currency and foreign transactions reporting act which is also known as the bank secrecy act and which has been amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 contains a variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering among other things the bank secrecy act and implementing regulations issued by the us treasury department require financialservices providers to establish antimoney laundering programs to report suspicious activity and to maintain a number of related records we maintain antimoney laundering controls designed to prevent our network from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit the implementation of the doddfrank act is still in its early stages and as a result its overall impact remains far from clear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that even though our industry was not targeted it is possible that we could be directly or indirectly impacted for example a provision of the law requires credit card issuers to collect and report information regarding applications made by women and minority owned businesses and small businesses we are preparing for this requirement but proposed regulations have not been published 

  

index to financial statements payment card industry rules 

partner banks issuing payment cards bearing the mastercard brand and fleetcor to the extent that we provide certain services in connection with those cards and fleet customers acting as merchants accepting those cards must comply with the bylaws regulations and requirements that are promulgated by mastercard and other applicable paymentcard organizations including the payment card industry data security standard developed by mastercard and visa the mastercard site data protection program and other applicable datasecurity program requirements 

state usury laws 

extensions of credit under many of our card products may be treated as commercial loans in some states usury laws limit the interest rates that can be charged not only on consumer loans but on commercial loans as well to the extent that these usury laws apply we are limited in the amount of interest that we can charge and collect from our customers because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions we utilize choice of law provisions in our cardholder agreements as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply in addition the interest rates on certain of our card products are set based upon the usury limit of the cardholder’s state with respect to card products where we work with a partner or issuing bank the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and “exports” the usury limit of that state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions 

other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing privacy data security and breach notification we are also subject to debtcollection laws and to bankruptcy and other debtorrelief laws that can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us 

employees and labor relations 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 2650 employees approximately 700 of whom were located in the united states we consider our employee relations to be good and have never experienced a work stoppage

index to financial statements 


 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2012 approximately 21 of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 18 of our consolidated revenue in 2012 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

index to financial statements if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers many of which are small to midsized businesses we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are fraudulently completed changes in our industry and movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports late payments and optional services we derived approximately 62 of our consolidated revenues from these fees and charges during the year ended december 31 2012 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity the extent to which they pay invoices late or their use of optional services our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies among others we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of food and fleet cards and vouchers commercial fleet cards offered by the major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service and account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

  

index to financial statements some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions for example major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” during 2012 our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for approximately 16 of our consolidated revenue our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from less than one year up to eight years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors such as pricing the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win this business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our business may be adversely affected 

a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers our new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution 

  

index to financial statements channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a yeartoyear basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the united states and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of fuel purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the united states europe and latin america and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other vehicle products and services by businesses unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession or other changes may lead our customers which are largely comprised of commercial fleets to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services these declines could result from among other things reduced fleet traffic corporate purchasing travel and other commercial activities from which we derive revenue 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase in addition demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states europe and latin america as a result sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states europe or latin america or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example within the past several years we have entered into the fuel and food card and voucher business in mexico the lodging card business in the united states the fuel transaction processing business in brazil and offer a limited telematics service to european customers we may continue to enter new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology or the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and 

  

index to financial statements improve upon our competitive position we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

at december 31 2012 we had approximately 923 million of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew on an annual basis 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper 

  

index to financial statements the securitization facility has a one year term during the financial crisis that began in 2008 the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us 

a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 44 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily czech koruna russian ruble british pound brazilian real and mexican peso revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we continue to expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer both in north america and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 

 

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 to complete future acquisitions we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the united states 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in belarus belgium botswana brazil canada the czech republic estonia ireland latvia lithuania luxembourg mexico namibia the netherlands pakistan poland the russian federation slovakia south africa swaziland ukraine and the united kingdom we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate specifically russia brazil and mexico have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the united states in particular changes in laws or regulations including with respect to taxation information technology data transmission and the internet or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the united states these include 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the united states we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to process and authorize transactions electronically depends on our ability to communicate with our merchants electronically through pointofsale devices and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties in addition in order to process transactions promptly our computer equipment and network servers must be functional 24 hours a day which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by thirdparties and the availability of electricity which we do not control a severe disruption of one or more of these networks including as a result of utility or thirdparty system interruptions could impair our ability to authorize transactions and process information which could harm our reputation result in a loss of customers or partners and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we also utilize thirdparty providers to assist us with disaster recovery operations as a result we are subject to the risk of a provider’s unresponsiveness in the event of a significant breakdown in our computer equipment or networks furthermore our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our products and services are based on proprietary and thirdparty network technology and processing systems that may encounter development delays and could be susceptible to undetected errors viruses or defects development delays system errors viruses or defects that result in service interruption or data loss could have a 

  

index to financial statements material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation and subject us to thirdparty liability in addition errors viruses and defects in our network technology and processing systems could result in additional development costs and the diversion of our technical and other resources from other development efforts or operations further our attempts to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our agreements may not be successful 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards we do not maintain any insurance to protect us against any such losses 

we may not be able to adequately protect the data we collect which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and partners including bank account information and expense data we keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the market for fleet card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally furthermore new technologies may displace fleet cards as payment mechanisms for fuel purchase transactions a decline in the acceptance and use of fleet cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards and food vouchers and cards is also evolving and that portion of our business is subject to similar risks 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 511 of our total assets at december 31 2012 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill is not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

index to financial statements if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties could claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility market exposure and add new products and services we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

index to financial statements our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the united states and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business consumers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business cardholders or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

in addition we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws or their interpretations could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively impacting our results of operations we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively impact our financial position operating results and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results 

  

index to financial statements we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among private contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in increased expenses 

we are not currently party to any legal proceedings or governmental inquiries or investigations that we consider to be material except as described below and we were not involved in any material legal proceedings that terminated during the fourth quarter we are and may become however subject to lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we are currently involved in an investigation by the office of fair trading in the united kingdom relating to our keyfuels product line this product line consists of our proprietary payment card and associated site network in the united kingdom a competitor alleged we are dominant in a relevant market with our keyfuels product line the office of fair trading is investigating whether we are dominant and if dominant whether some of our contracts with some sites and dealers would constitute exclusive dealings requiring them to be reformed to eliminate exclusivity the office of fair trading has issued a statement of objections which we responded to and we are awaiting its conclusions if determined adversely the regulator has authority to require us to reform contracts to eliminate exclusivity and impose significant fines which could be material any adverse determination is appealable to the competition appeal tribunal 

we rely on third parties for card issuing and processing services supporting our mastercard network fleet card products failure to maintain these contractual relationships upon acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card offerings customer retention and operating results 

some of our fleetcard products in north america are accepted in the mastercard merchant network pursuant to our contractual relationships with issuing banks and thirdparty processors in order to continue offering fleet cards accepted at mastercard network merchants we must maintain our contractual relationship with at least one issuing bank further unless we develop our own mastercardapproved processing capabilities we must continue to obtain processing services from at least one processor approved by mastercard with the capability to provide acceptable levels of reporting data for fleet operators our failure to maintain adequate relationships or find suitable alternatives could have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card products our customer retention and our operating results 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded fleet cards interchange fee amounts associated 

  

index to financial statements with our mastercard network fleet cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network fleetcard transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us and uk regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and the uk bribery act such laws prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our principal stockholders have a controlling influence over our business affairs 

our principal stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own or control directly or indirectly at december 31 2012 approximately 24661000 shares of our common stock which in the aggregate represents approximately 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result if some of these persons or entities act together they will have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election and removal of directors amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 

some of these persons or entities who make up our principal stockholders may have interests different from our other stockholders for example they may be more interested in selling fleetcor to an acquirer than other stockholders or may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements in addition our certificate of incorporation prohibits large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or consolidating with us except under certain circumstances these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 

we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

we currently expect to retain all future earnings if any for future operation expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our operating results financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in addition we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as of the date of this filing we are not currently party to any legal proceedings or governmental inquiries or investigations that we consider to be material except as described below and we were not involved in any material legal proceedings that terminated during the fourth quarter we are and may become however subject to lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we are currently involved in an investigation by the office of fair trading in the united kingdom relating to our keyfuels product line this product line consists of our proprietary payment card and associated site network in the united kingdom a competitor alleged we are dominant in a relevant market with our keyfuels product line the office of fair trading is investigating whether we are dominant and if dominant whether some of our contracts with some sites and dealers would constitute exclusive dealings requiring them to be reformed to eliminate exclusivity the office of fair trading has issued a statement of objections which we responded to and we are awaiting its conclusions if determined adversely the regulator has authority to require us to reform contracts to eliminate exclusivity and impose significant fines which could be material any adverse determination is appealable to the competition appeal tribunal

index to financial statements our segments sources of revenue and expenses 

segments 

we operate in two segments which we refer to as our north american and international segments the results from our mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher business acquired during the third quarter of 2011 the allstar business acquired during the fourth quarter of 2011 the russian businesses acquired during the second and third quarter of 2012 and ctf technologies inc acquired during the third quarter of 2012 are each reported in our international segment our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue” for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 our north american and international segments generated the following revenue 

 

 sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions and the related revenue per transaction as illustrated in the diagram below a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners for whom we manage card programs revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as our customers and partners through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel vehicle maintenance food or lodging services to our customers we also earn revenue from our customers and partners through program fees and charges the following diagram illustrates a typical transaction flow 

illustrative transaction flow 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue mostly from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction as illustrated in the table below the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a “merchant commission” 

  

index to financial statements and is recognized as an expense we also derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships through a variety of program transaction and fixed fees approximately 531 and 486 of our revenue during 2012 and 2011 was derived from our merchant and network relationships 

illustrative revenue model for fuel purchases 

unit of one gallon 

 

 from our customers and partners we derive revenue from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and report fees our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk approximately 469 and 514 of our revenue during 2012 and 2011 was derived from customer and partner program fees and charges 

transaction volume and revenue per transaction set forth below is revenue per transaction information for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and the overall macroeconomic environment including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases as macroeconomic factors changes and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates 

  

index to financial statements revenue per transaction in our international segment has historically run higher than the north america segment due primarily to higher margins and higher fuel prices in our international product lines however acquisitions in 2011 have significantly impacted revenue per transaction in our international segment as well as on a consolidated basis in 2011 we acquired a mexican business and allstar in the uk which together contributed to the increase in transaction volumes and revenues in our international segment while the acquired mexican and uk businesses represent good profit margin businesses they do have lower revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses the impact of the products offered by our businesses acquired in mexico and the uk were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 in 2012 we acquired a russian fuel card business and ctf technologies inc ctf which have higher revenue per transaction products in comparison to our businesses however the overall impact of these acquisitions resulted in lower revenue per transaction for our international segment and on a consolidated basis 

from 2011 to 2012 total transactions increased from 2148 million to 3038 million an increase of 890 million or 414 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north american and international segments primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 

from 2010 to 2011 total transactions increased from 1904 million to 2148 million excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract in europe an increase of 244 million or 128 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north american and international segments excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract in europe primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisitions in 2011 this nonrenewed partner had a high number of transactions and very little revenue 

sources of revenue set forth below are our sources of revenue for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues 

 

  

 adjusted revenues ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share set forth below are adjusted revenues ebitda adjusted net income and diluted adjusted net income per share for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

 

 we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate thus we believe this is a more 

  

index to financial statements effective way to evaluate our revenue performance on a consistent basis we use ebitda calculated as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to eliminate the impact of certain noncore items during the period we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental nongaap financial measures of operating performance see the heading entitled “management’s use of nongaap financial measures” 

sources of expenses 

we incur expenses in the following categories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 factors and trends impacting our business 

we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

 accounts receivable securitization 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility securitization facility in the ordinary course of our business to finance a portion of our accounts receivable prior to 2010 activity associated with our securitization facility was recorded offbalance sheet utilizing a qualified specialpurpose entity or qspe in the form of a limited liability company the qspe raised funds by issuing debt to thirdparty investors the qspe held trade accounts receivable whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the liabilities of the qspe investors only had recourse to the assets held by the qspe our involvement in these arrangements takes the form of originating accounts receivable and providing servicing activities 

  

index to financial statements in 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset the concept of a qspe entity which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers is removed by this standard this guidance was effective for us as of january 1 2010 as a result of the adoption of such guidance we consolidated the qspe and the securitization of accounts receivable related to the qspe is accounted for as a secured borrowing rather than as a sale accordingly we record accounts receivable and shortterm debt related to the securitization facilities as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet in addition our statements of income no longer include securitization activities in revenue rather we report provision for bad debts and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued by the qspe in processing expense and interest expense net respectively on the consolidated statements of income 

as a result of the implementation of this guidance effective january 1 2010 we recorded a 2180 million increase in accounts receivable and a 2180 million increase in current liabilities see “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further details 

acquisitions 

during 2012 we acquired three companies the two largest of which are described below the third acquisition was immaterial the results of our additional russian fuel card company and ctf technologies inc “ctf” businesses are included within our international segment from the date of acquisition 

 

  

 during 2011 we acquired two companies which are described below the results of our mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher business and allstar business are included within our international segment from the date of acquisition

 revenues and revenue per transaction 

our consolidated revenue increased from 5196 million in 2011 to 7075 million in 2012 an increase of 1879 million or 362 the increase in our consolidated revenue was primarily due to 

 

  

  

   

index to financial statements consolidated revenue per transaction decreased from 242 in 2011 to 233 in 2012 a decrease of 009 per transaction or 37 this decrease is primarily due to the full year impact in 2012 of acquisitions completed in 2011 as noted above that have products with lower overall revenue per transaction than our other businesses consolidated revenue per transaction was further impacted by the reasons discussed above 

north american segment revenues and revenue per transaction 

north american revenue increased from 3488 million in 2011 to 4001 million in 2012 an increase of 513 million or 147 the increase in our north american revenue was primarily due to

international segment revenue 

international segment revenue increased from 1708 million in 2011 to 3074 million in 2012 an increase of 1366 million or 800 the increase in international segment revenue was due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

 international segment revenue per transaction decreased from 275 in 2011 to 209 in 2012 a decrease of 066 per transaction or 240 this decrease is primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 that have products with lower overall revenue per transaction than our other businesses international revenue per transaction was further impacted by the reasons discussed above 

consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions increased from 512 million in 2011 to 586 million in 2012 an increase of 74 million or 145 this increase was primarily due to the fluctuation in the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel which impacted merchant commissions and the impact of higher volume in revenues streams where merchant commissions are paid partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

processing processing expenses increased from 845 million in 2011 to 1155 million in 2012 an increase of 310 million or 367 during 2012 our processing expenses increased primarily due to acquisitions completed 

  

index to financial statements in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 which have a higher rate of processing expenses as a percentage of revenues in comparison to our other businesses partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

selling selling expenses increased from 366 million in 2011 to 464 million in 2012 an increase of 98 million or 268 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 as well as additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from 848 million in 2011 to 1101 million in 2012 an increase of 253 million or 298 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 362 million in 2011 to 520 million in 2012 an increase of 158 million or 436 the increase was primarily due to additional amortization and depreciation from acquired intangible assets and fixed assets due to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 which resulted in an increase of 149 million in 2012 over 2011 this increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 2263 million in 2011 to 3249 million in 2012 an increase of 986 million or 436 our operating margin was 436 and 459 for 2011 and 2012 respectively the increase in operating income and margin from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to organic growth in the business the impact of acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 and the positive effective of the macroeconomic environment including higher fuel prices higher fuel spread revenues partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

additionally during 2011 and 2012 we completed the acquisitions of a mexican business allstar ctf and a russian fuel card business which together contributed to the increase in consolidated operating income however the mexican business allstar business and ctf each produce lower margin products in comparison to our other businesses and when combined with our other businesses’ operating income produced a lower margin than would have resulted without the acquisitions 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north american segment operating income 

north american operating income increased from 1537 million in 2011 to 1967 million in 2012 an increase of 430 million or 280 north american operating margin was 441 and 491 for 2011 and 2012 respectively the increase in operating income from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to organic growth in the business and the impact of the positive macroeconomic environment including higher fuel prices and higher fuel spread revenues 

international segment operating income 

international operating income increased from 726 million in 2011 to 1282 million in 2012 an increase of 556 million or 766 international operating margin was 425 and 417 for 2011 and 2012 respectively the increase in operating income from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed 

  

index to financial statements in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 organic growth in the business and the impact of the positive macroeconomic environment including slightly higher fuel prices and higher fuel spread margins partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates these increases were partially offset by additional amortization related to acquisitions completed in 2012 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 and onetime transaction related costs 

the lower operating margin was due to the acquisitions of our mexican business allstar business and ctf which each produce lower margin products in comparison to our other businesses 

other expense income net 

other expense income net increased from income of 06 million 2011 to expense of 11 million in 2012 an increase of 17 million the increase was due primarily to expenses related to our secondary stock offerings during the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2012 as well as foreign currency exchange gains recognized during 2011 

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased from 134 million in 2011 to 130 million in 2012 a decrease of 04 million or 30 the decrease is due primarily to lower average interest rates paid on debt instruments in 2012 over 2011 the reduction in our average interest rates is a result of the refinancing of the 2005 credit facility and ccs facility to a new us credit facility in june 2011 that carries a lower interest rate the reduction in rates is also due to the renewing of our accounts receivable securitization facility to a new 364 day term with a lower interest rate the average interest rate paid on borrowings on our domestic revolving line of credit term loans including the unused credit facility fee and foreign swing line of credit under our new credit facility was 199 200 and 203 respectively in 2012 the average interest rate paid on borrowings on our domestic line of credit and term loans including the unused credit facility fee on our new credit facility was 254 and 205 respectively in 2011 the average interest rate on the 2005 credit facility was 254 in 2011 the average interest rate on the ccs credit facility was 266 in 2011 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased from 27 million in 2011 to zero in 2012 this decrease is due to the writeoff of 17 million and 10 million in deferred debt issuance costs associated with the early extinguishment of the 2005 facility and ccs credit facility respectively upon retirement of these credit facilities with the proceeds from our new credit facility signed on june 22 2011 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 635 million in 2011 to 946 million in 2012 an increase of 311 million or 490 the increase from 2011 to 2012 was due primarily to an increase in our income before income tax and an increase in our effective tax rate from 301 in 2011 to 304 in 2012 the increase in our effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in taxes of 19 million during the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the impact of the controlled foreign corporation lookthrough exclusion expiring for the company on december 1 2012 the exclusion was retroactively extended in january 2013 however on december 31 2012 the retroactive extension had not been passed see also “note 11income taxes” for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective tax rate

consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions increased from 491 million in 2010 to 512 million in 2011 an increase of 21 million or 43 this increase was due primarily to the fluctuation in the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel 

processing processing expenses increased from 697 million in 2010 to 845 million in 2011 an increase of 148 million or 212 during 2011 our processing expenses were primarily impacted by volume increases and a card conversion project in certain of our payment programs a onetime contract termination charge the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 

  

index to financial statements selling selling expenses increased from 327 million in 2010 to 366 million in 2011 an increase of 39 million or 119 the increase was due primarily to additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from 781 million in 2010 to 848 million in 2011 an increase of 67 million or 86 the increase was primarily due to additional public company costs during the period one time transaction related costs the impact of acquisitions completed during 2011 and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by a decrease in noncash stock compensation expense related to our stock incentive plans 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 337 million in 2010 to 362 million in 2011 an increase of 25 million or 74 the increase was primarily attributable to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2010 which resulted in an increase of 22 million due to additional amortization and depreciation of acquired intangible and fixed assets 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 1705 million in 2010 to 2263 million in 2011 an increase of 558 million or 327 our operating margin was 393 and 436 for 2010 and 2011 respectively the increase in operating income from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to organic growth in the business the impact of acquisitions completed during 2011 the impact of the positive macroeconomic environment including higher fuel prices higher fuel spread revenues and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates these increases were partially offset by additional amortization expense related to acquisitions completed during 2010 and 2011 public company costs onetime transaction related costs and additional costs to support the growth in our business 

additionally during 2011 we completed the acquisition of our mexican business and allstar business which together contributed to the increase in consolidated operating income however the mexican business and allstar business each produce lower margin products in comparison to our other businesses and when combined with our other businesses’ operating income produced a lower margin than would have resulted without the acquisitions 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north american segment operating income 

north american operating income increased from 1067 million in 2010 to 1537 million in 2011 an increase of 470 million or 440 north american operating margin was 371 and 441 for 2010 and 2011 respectively the increase in operating income from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to organic growth in the business less stock compensation expense related to our stock incentive plans and the impact of a positive macroeconomic environment including higher fuel prices and higher fuel spread revenues these increases were partially offset by additional public company costs incurred in 2011 compared to 2010

index to financial statements impact of foreign exchange rates these increases were partially offset by additional amortization expense related to acquisitions completed during 2010 and 2011 onetime transaction related costs and additional costs to support the growth in our business 

the lower operating margin was due to the acquisitions of our mexican business and allstar business which each produce lower margin products in comparison to our other businesses 

other expense income net 

other expense income net decreased from income of 13 million 2010 to 06 million in 2011 a decrease of 07 million or 538 the decrease was due primarily to lower foreign currency exchange gains recognized during 2011 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased from 205 million in 2010 to 134 million in 2011 a decrease of 71 million or 346 this decrease was primarily due to the expiration of an interest rate swap agreement which matured in november 2010 which resulted in additional interest expense of 60 million in 2010 the remaining decrease is due to lower average interest rates paid on debt instruments in 2011 over 2010 and lower term debt balances outstanding on our term loan facilities the reduction in our average interest rates is a result of the refinancing of the 2005 credit facility and ccs facility to a new us credit facility in june 2011 that carries a lower interest rate the average interest rate paid on borrowings on our domestic line of credit and term loans including the unused credit facility fee on our new credit facility was 254 and 205 respectively in 2011 the average interest rate on the 2005 credit facility was 254 in 2011 compared to 475 including impact of our interest rate swap in 2010 the average interest rate on the ccs credit facility was 266 in 2011 compared to 272 in 2010

the provision for income taxes increased from 434 million in 2010 to 635 million in 2011 an increase of 201 million or 463 the increase from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to an increase in our income before income tax and an increase in our effective tax rate from 287 in 2010 to 301 in 2011 the increase in our effective tax rate was due primarily to a onetime favorable reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions in 2010 which was not repeated in 2011 see also “note 11income taxes” for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective tax rate

for the reasons discussed above our net income increased from 1079 million in 2010 to 1473 million in 2011 an increase of 394 million or 365 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness complete acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

  

index to financial statements sources of liquidity 

at december 31 2012 our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance totaled 2836 million our restricted cash balance at december 31 2012 totaled 537 million restricted cash primarily represents customer deposits in the czech republic which we are restricted from using other than to repay customer deposits and which may not be deposited outside of the czech republic 

at december 31 2012 cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested is 2596 million all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries excluding restricted cash are available for general corporate purposes our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time we currently believe that funds generated from our us operations along with potential borrowing capabilities in the us will be sufficient to fund our us operations for the foreseeable future and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our us operations however if at a future date or time these funds are needed for our operations in the us or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds no assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof the tax consequences related thereto or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic fuel card receivables to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants within seven days of receiving the merchant billing as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes or for acquisitions at december 31 2012 we had the ability to generate approximately 14 million of additional liquidity under our securitization facility 

on november 6 2012 we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement to add an additional term loan of 250 million and increase the borrowing limit on the revolving line of credit 250 million in addition we increased the accordion feature from 150 million to 250 million as amended the credit agreement provides for a 550 million term loan facility and a 850 million revolving credit facility the second amendment to the credit facility provides 500 million of additional liquidity which when combined with the availability under the credit facility at december 31 2012 provides us with total liquidity under the credit facility of approximately 14 billion we anticipate using the increased facility primarily to help fund future acquisitions for working capital and other general corporate purposes including to potentially fund share repurchases from certain of our significant legacy investors at december 31 2012 we had approximately 750 million undrawn on our revolving credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all

 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased from 2796 million in to 1355 million in 2012 the decrease is primarily due to a customer deposit of 46 million and a liability acquired with the allstar acquisition of 108 million that were each paid in 2012 the remaining fluctuation is due to changes in working capital as well as additional net income of 689 million 

net cash provided by operating activities increased from 1398 million in 2010 to 2796 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due additional net income of 394 million and decreases in working capital driven by changes in current liabilities accounts receivable and other current assets 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased from 3472 million in 2011 to 2096 million in 2012 the decrease in cash used in investing activities is attributable to the decrease in cash used for acquisitions in 2012 of 1433 million net of cash acquired

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased from 2362 million in 2011 to 620 million in 2012 a decrease of 1742 million the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the repurchase of common stock for 200 million in december 2012 as well as fewer net borrowings on our debt instruments in 2012 over 2011 

net cash provided by financing activities increased from cash used in financing activities of 865 million in 2010 to cash provided by financing activities of 2362 million in 2011 an increase of 3227 million the increase in cash provided by financing activities is attributable primarily to additional net borrowings on our securitization facility of 2100 million in 2011 compared to 2010 additionally in june 2011 we entered into a new fiveyear 900 million credit facility which provided additional cash from financing activities during 2011 of 1107 million net of payments made over the same period in 2010 proceeds from this new credit facility were used to retire our indebtedness under our 2005 credit facility and ccs credit facility

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or 

  

index to financial statements results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and presentation 

revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as from customers and partners we recognize revenue on fees generated through services to commercial fleets major oil companies and petroleum marketers and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following i we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the acceptability of the product ii we have no inventory risk do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the product or have any involvement in the product specifications iii we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for the product predominantly fuel and iv the amount we earn for our services is fixed 

through our merchant and network relationships we primarily provide fuel prepaid cards vehicle maintenance or lodging services to our customers we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction our net revenue consists of margin on fuel sales and fees for technical support processing communications and reporting the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as expense when the fuel purchase transaction is executed we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the services have been provided to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we have entered into agreements with major oil companies and petroleum marketers that specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records 

we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees report fees and other transactionbased fees which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed number of transactions processed or some combination thereof such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of thirdparty networks transaction fees and other transactionbased fees generated from our proprietary networks and thirdparty networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured card fees network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations in addition we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed

index to financial statements our fiscal year ends on december 31 in certain of our uk businesses we record the operating results using a 445 week accounting cycle with the fiscal year ending on the friday on or immediately preceding december 31 fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 all include 52 weeks for the businesses reporting using a 445 accounting cycle 

accounts receivable 

as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a 500 million revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a evolving basis to fleetcor funding llc funding a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary conduit in turn funding sells without recourse on a revolving basis up to 500 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit funding maintains a subordinated interest in the form of over collateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper on february 6 2012 we extended the term of the securitization facility to february 4 2013 

we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature 

funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable subject to a maximum amount prior to the adoption of new accounting guidance on january 1 2010 unding retained a residual interest in the eligible receivables transferred such that amounts payable in respect of such residual interest will be distributed to funding upon payment in full of all amounts owed by funding to the financial institutions 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset the concept of a qualifying special purposeentity which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers was removed by this guidance in addition the guidance also shifts the determination of which enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity vie to a current control approach such that an entity that has both the power to make decisions and the right to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie will consolidate a vie the guidance also requires ongoing assessments related to who should consolidate the vie this guidance was effective as of january 1 2010 

we analyzed the impact of the changes to the accounting guidance and concluded that it would consolidate funding we concluded it would consolidate this vie because we maintain significant decisionmaking rights own a variable interest that could be potentially significant to the vie and receive all the benefits or is required to absorb all the losses of funding accordingly effective january 1 2010 we consolidated funding using the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of funding as prescribed by the accounting guidance and any corresponding elimination of activity between funding and us resulting from the consolidation on january 1 2010 we recorded a 218 million increase in total assets a 218 million increase in total liabilities and noncash financing activities of 218 million 

beginning january 1 2010 our consolidated balance sheet and statement of income no longer reflect activity related to our retained residual interest in eligible accounts receivable sold to funding but instead reflect activity related to our securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt including interest income fees generated from late payments provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense interest expense and the provision for losses on accounts receivable associated with the securitized accounts receivable are no longer included as a deduction from revenues net in the consolidated statements of income the cash flows from borrowings and repayments associated with the securitized debt are presented as cash flows from financing activities 

  

index to financial statements on february 4 2013 we extended the term of the securitization facility to february 3 2014 we capitalized 06 million in deferred financing fees in connection with this extension 

all foreign receivables are owned receivables and are not included in our receivable securitization program at december 31 2012 and 2011 there was 298 million and 280 million respectively of shortterm debt outstanding under our securitization facility 

credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables 

we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers payments from customers are generally due within 14 days of billing we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible and removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency recoveries from the thirdparty collection agency are not significant 

impairment of longlived assets and intangibles 

we test our other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows we determine the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally we perform our testing of the asset group at the businessline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

we complete an asset impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and the impairment test consists of two steps as well as a qualitative assessment as appropriate we have performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step 1 test from the prior year updated with current year results weightedaverage cost of capital rates and future projections 

we completed step 1 of the goodwill impairment testing for certain of our reporting units in this first step the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies if 

  

index to financial statements the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangibles as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using our estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate 

preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions significant changes in our forecasts the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 

based on the goodwill asset impairment test on october 1 2012 we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with relevant authoritative literature income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible on a quarterly basis we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with authoritative literature we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income taxes payable and income tax expense 

  

index to financial statements we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

current guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained 

business combinations 

we have accounted for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income for significant acquisitions we obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed the estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction 

these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are adjusted through operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses certain acquisitions include additional contingent consideration related to future earnouts based on the growth of the market contingent earnouts are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred 

stockbased compensation 

we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grand date fair value of stock option awards granted we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options we base the riskfree interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant prior to july 2012 due to the limited time we had been public we estimated the volatility of the share price of our common stock by considering the historical volatility of the stock of similar public entities in determining the appropriateness of the public entities included in the volatility assumption we considered a number of factors including the entity’s life cycle stage size financial leverage and products offered beginning july 1 2012 we began utilizing the volatility of the share price of our common stock to estimate the volatility assumption for the blackscholes option pricing model stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

  

index to financial statements awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting prior to our initial public offering the vesting of the shares granted in 2010 were contingent on the sale of our company or a public offering of our common stock subject to certain other conditions the vesting of the shares granted in 2010 and beyond are generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years the fair value of restricted stock shares based on performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock shares based on market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo option pricing model the riskfree interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo option pricing model are calculated consistently with those applied in the blackscholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards for performancebased restricted stock awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

adoption of new accounting standards 

fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201104 “amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs” which amends accounting standards codification “asc” 820 “fair value measurement” to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and ifrs the amendments in this update explain how to measure fair value they do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting the amendments were effective for and adopted by us on january 1 2012 and are required to be applied prospectively since asu 201104 is a disclosureonly standard our adoption of this asu did not affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

other comprehensive income reclassifications 

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201112 “deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105” which supersedes certain pending paragraphs in asu 201105 asu 201112 defers the requirement of asu 201105 requiring entities to present reclassification adjustments by component in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements asu 201112 was effective for and adopted by us beginning january 1 2012 our adoption of this asu did not affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

qualitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu 201202 “intangibles—goodwill and other” which gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired the proposed guidance is similar to asu 201108 for goodwill companies would consider relevant events and circumstances that may affect the significant inputs used in determining the 

  

index to financial statements fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset a company that concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an asset exceeds its carrying amount would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset in the current year however if a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired it must calculate the fair value of the asset and compare that value with its carrying amount as is required by current guidance asu 201202 would be applied prospectively for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 with early adoption permitted our adoption of this asu is not expected to affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 “reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci” asu 201302 under asu 201302 an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of aoci by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts asu 201302 does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements asu 201302 is effective for us on january 1 2013

 management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

we have included in the discussion under the caption “adjusted revenues ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share” above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap we have also included in the discussion under the caption “transaction volume and revenue per transaction” above a financial measure that was not prepared in accordance with gaap any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 

  

index to financial statements below we define the nongaap financial measures provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

adjusted revenues 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted revenues as revenues net less merchant commissions as reflected in our income statement 

we use adjusted revenues as a basis to evaluate our revenues net of the commissions that are paid to merchants to participate in our card programs the commissions paid to merchants can vary when market spreads fluctuate in much the same way as revenues are impacted when market spreads fluctuate we believe that adjusted revenue is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our revenue performance on a consistent basis adjusted revenues are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in thousands 

 

 ebitda 

we have defined the nongaap measure ebitda as net income as reflected in our income statement adjusted to eliminate a interest expense b tax expense c depreciation of longlived assets and d amortization of intangible assets 

we use ebitda as a basis to evaluate our operating performance net of the impact of certain noncore items during the period we believe that ebitda may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis ebitda is not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income in thousands 

 

   

index to financial statements adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our income statement adjusted to eliminate a noncash stock based compensation expense related sharebased compensation awards b amortization of deferred financing costs and intangible assets c amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables and d loss on the early extinguishment of debt 

we have defined the nongaap measure adjusted net income per diluted share as the calculation previously noted divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding as reflected in our income statement 

we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance we believe it is useful to exclude noncash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because noncash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired therefore we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income we also exclude loss on the early extinguishment of debt from adjusted net income as this expense is noncash and is onetime in nature and does not reflect the ongoing operations of the business we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income and net income per diluted share in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract 

we have defined the nongaap measure revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract as revenues net as reflected in our income statement and segment footnote less the revenues net provided by the nonrenewed partner in the year ended december 31 2010 

  

index to financial statements our management uses revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract along with other factors to evaluate our financial performance we believe that revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors because it provides a more complete understanding of our revenue performance of continuing business revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract is not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in thousands for the year ended december 31 2010

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2012 management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2012 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework as of december 31 2012 management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

in connection with management’s evaluation our management team excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 the internal controls relating to two subsidiaries that we acquired during the year ended december 31 2012 and for which financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements on july 3 2012 we acquired all of the stock of ctf technologies inc brazilian fuel transaction processor on june 15 2012 we acquired all of the stock of a leading russian fuel card company russian fuel card company the brazilian fuel transaction processor and russian fuel card company constituted 3 of total assets and 5 of net assets respectively as of december 31 2012 and 7 of revenues and 6 of net income respectively for the year then ended this exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements 

  

index to financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2012 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 competition 

we face considerable competition in our business the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service and account management and price we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors however we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to each of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

  

index to financial statements we compete with independent fleet card providers providers of card outsourcing services and major financial services companies as well as major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards we also compete with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house accounts as well as other forms of credit our primary independent fleet card competitors are wright express corporation comdata corporation and us bank voyager fleet systems inc in north america and wright express corporation edenred and sodexo inc internationally

regulatory 

a substantial number of laws and regulations both in the united states and in other jurisdictions apply to businesses offering payment cards to customers or processing or servicing for payment cards and related accounts in the united states these laws apply primarily to consumer cards which are cards used to make purchases for personal family or household purposes because our payment cards are limited to purchases for business purposes only they are typically classified as commercial cards and are generally not subject to many of the laws and regulations applicable to consumer cards as a result our business is less regulated than one that provides products or services to consumers yet we are still subject to significant domestic and foreign regulation 

the following while not exhaustive is a description of several federal and state laws and regulations in the united states that are applicable to our business the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions also affect us and they may be more or less restrictive than those in the united states and may also impact different parts of our operations in addition the legal and regulatory framework governing our business is subject to ongoing revision and changes in that framework could have a significant effect on us 

federal trade commission act 

the federal trade commission act empowers the federal trade commission or ftc to regulate unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce while this power is generally exercised to protect consumers the ftc has sometimes taken action on behalf of small businesses a number of state laws and regulations also prohibit unfair and deceptive business practices 

truth in lending act 

the truth in lending act or tila was enacted to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit and is implemented by regulation z most provisions of tila and regulation z apply only to the extension of consumer credit but a limited number apply to commercial cards as well one example where tila and regulation z are generally applicable is a limitation on liability for unauthorized use although a business that acquires 10 or more credit cards for its personnel can agree to more expansive liability our cardholder agreements generally provide for these business customers to waive to the fullest extent possible all limitations on liability for unauthorized card use 

credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 

the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 amended provisions of tila that affect consumer credit and also directed the federal reserve board to study the use of credit cards by small businesses and to make legislative recommendations the report concluded that it is not clear whether the potential benefits outweigh the increased cost and reduced credit availability if the disclosure and substantive restrictions applicable to consumer cards were to be applied to small business cards legislation has been introduced to increase the protections afforded to small businesses that use payment cards if legislation of this kind were enacted our products and services for small businesses could be impacted 

  

index to financial statements equal credit opportunity act 

the equal credit opportunity act or ecoa together with regulation b prohibit creditors from discriminating on certain prohibited bases such as an applicant’s sex race nationality age and marital status and further requires that creditors disclose the reasons for taking any adverse action against an applicant or a customer seeking credit 

the fair credit reporting act 

the fair credit reporting act or fcra regulates consumer reporting agencies and the disclosure and use of consumer reports we may obtain consumer reports with respect to an individual who guarantees or otherwise is obligated on a commercial card

the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 amended fcra and requires creditors to adopt identity theft prevention programs to detect prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with covered accounts which can include business accounts for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft 

bank secrecy act 

the currency and foreign transactions reporting act which is also known as the bank secrecy act and which has been amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 contains a variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering among other things the bank secrecy act and implementing regulations issued by the us treasury department require financialservices providers to establish antimoney laundering programs to report suspicious activity and to maintain a number of related records we maintain antimoney laundering controls designed to prevent our network from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing 

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act effected comprehensive revisions to a wide array of federal laws governing financial institutions financial services and financial markets among its most notable provisions is the creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection which is charged with regulating consumer financial products or services and which is assuming much of the rulemaking authority under tila ecoa fcra and other federal laws affecting the extension of credit the implementation of the doddfrank act is still in its early stages and as a result its overall impact remains far from clear its provisions however are sufficiently far reaching that even though our industry was not targeted it is possible that we could be directly or indirectly impacted for example a provision of the law requires credit card issuers to collect and report information regarding applications made by women and minority owned businesses and small businesses we are preparing for this requirement but proposed regulations have not been published 

payment card industry rules 

partner banks issuing payment cards bearing the mastercard brand and fleetcor to the extent that we provide certain services in connection with those cards and fleet customers acting as merchants accepting those cards must comply with the bylaws regulations and requirements that are promulgated by mastercard and other applicable paymentcard organizations including the payment card industry data security standard developed by mastercard and visa the mastercard site data protection program and other applicable datasecurity program requirements 

  

index to financial statements state usury laws 

extensions of credit under many of our card products may be treated as commercial loans in some states usury laws limit the interest rates that can be charged not only on consumer loans but on commercial loans as well to the extent that these usury laws apply we are limited in the amount of interest that we can charge and collect from our customers because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions we utilize choice of law provisions in our cardholder agreements as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply in addition the interest rates on certain of our card products are set based upon the usury limit of the cardholder’s state with respect to card products where we work with a partner or issuing bank the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and “exports” the usury limit of that state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions 

other laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing privacy data security and breach notification we are also subject to debtcollection laws and to bankruptcy and other debtorrelief laws that can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2011 approximately 20 of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel in this annual report for the periods between january 1 2005 and december 31 2009 we refer to our consolidated revenue as adjusted for the impact of the new accounting guidance related to our securitization facility as our “consolidated revenue on a managed basis” for the periods prior to january 1 2005 we did not maintain a securitization facility changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 19 of our consolidated revenue in 2011 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

index to financial statements if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers many of which are small to midsized businesses we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are fraudulently completed changes in our industry and movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we derive a portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports late payments and optional services we derived approximately 55 of our consolidated revenues from these fees and charges during the year ended december 31 2011 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity the extent to which they pay invoices late or their use of optional services our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies online lodging discounters internal corporate procurement and travel resources and independent services companies among others we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service and account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources in 

  

index to financial statements addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions for example major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further competitors may reduce the fees for their services which could increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” during 2011 our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for approximately 21 of our consolidated revenue in the year ended december 31 2011 one partner chevron accounted for approximately 11 of our consolidated revenue and one other partner represented greater than 5 of our consolidated revenue during 2011 our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from less than one year up to ten years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors such as pricing the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win this business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our business may be adversely affected 

a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers our new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue 

  

index to financial statements similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a yeartoyear basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the united states and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of fuel purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions particularly in the united states and europe and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other vehicle products and services by businesses unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession or other changes may lead our customers which are largely comprised of commercial fleets to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services these declines could result from among other things reduced fleet traffic corporate purchasing travel and other commercial activities from which we derive revenue 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase in addition demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states and europe as a result sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states or europe or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example within the past several years we have entered into the fuel and food card and voucher business in mexico the lodging card business in the united states and offer a limited telematics service to european customers we may continue to enter new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology or the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the 

  

index to financial statements technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 419 million of indebtedness outstanding in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

  

index to financial statements we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew on an annual basis 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a one year term during the financial crisis that began in 2008 the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us 

a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 330 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily czech koruna russian ruble british pound and mexican peso revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the united states 

we have foreign operations in or provide services for commercial card accounts in belarus belgium botswana canada the czech republic estonia ireland latvia lithuania luxembourg mexico namibia the netherlands pakistan poland the russian federation slovakia south africa swaziland ukraine and the united kingdom we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the united states in particular changes in laws or regulations including with respect to taxation information technology data transmission and the internet or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect 

  

index to financial statements our business operating results and financial condition in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the united states these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the united states we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to process and authorize transactions electronically depends on our ability to communicate with our merchants electronically through pointofsale devices and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties in addition in order to process transactions promptly our computer equipment and network servers must be functional 24 hours a day which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by thirdparties and the availability of electricity which we do not control a severe disruption of one or more of these networks including as a result of utility or thirdparty system interruptions could impair our ability to authorize transactions and process information which could harm our reputation result in a loss of customers or partners and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we also utilize thirdparty providers to assist us with disaster recovery operations as a result we are subject to the risk of a provider’s unresponsiveness in the event of a significant breakdown in our computer equipment or networks furthermore our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

  

index to financial statements we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relationships decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our products and services are based on proprietary and thirdparty network technology and processing systems that may encounter development delays and could be susceptible to undetected errors viruses or defects development delays system errors viruses or defects that result in service interruption or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation and subject us to thirdparty liability in addition errors viruses and defects in our network technology and processing systems could result in additional development costs and the diversion of our technical and other resources from other development efforts or operations further our attempts to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our agreements may not be successful 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards we do not maintain any insurance to protect us against any such losses 

we may not be able to adequately protect the data we collect which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and partners including bank account information and expense data we keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we expect to expand through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer both in north america and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore acquisitions may 

 

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements  in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 to complete a future acquisition we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

the market for fleet card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally furthermore new technologies may displace fleet cards as payment mechanisms for fuel purchase transactions a decline in the acceptance and use of fleet cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards and food vouchers and cards is also evolving and that portion of our business is subject to similar risks 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 483 of our total assets at december 31 2011 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of 

  

index to financial statements additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill is not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties could claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual 

  

index to financial statements property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the united states and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business consumers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business cardholders or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services 

our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services and the costs of their operations these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business 

in addition we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws or their interpretations could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are 

  

index to financial statements exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue or increased credit risk and related losses resulting in increased expenses in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities including state and local government customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among private contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in increased expenses 

we are not currently party to any legal proceedings or governmental inquiries or investigations that we consider to be material we are however subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business which if ultimately determined unfavorably could force us to pay damages or fines or change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition we may become involved in various actions or proceedings brought by domestic and foreign governmental regulatory agencies in connection with acquisitions or in the event of alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations which could potentially subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restricting the conduct of our business we are currently involved in such an investigation by the office of fair trading in the united kingdom relating to our keyfuels product line this product line consists of our proprietary payment card and associated site network in the united kingdom a competitor alleged we are dominant in a relevant market with our keyfuels product line the office of fair trading is investigating whether we are dominant and if dominant whether some of our contracts with some sites and dealers would constitute exclusive dealings requiring them to be reformed to eliminate exclusivity the office of fair trading has issued a statement of objections which we have responded to and we are awaiting its conclusions although we do not currently anticipate an adverse result or material adverse impact from the investigation if determined adversely the regulator has authority to require us to reform contracts to eliminate exclusivity and impose significant fines we also notified the office of fair trading about our recent acquisition of allstar business solutions limited in which we provided an analysis that the acquisition does not result in a substantial lessening of competition on any affected market and we subsequently responded to questions posed by the office of fair trading in the course of its review we anticipate that the office of fair trading will determine whether or not to make a referral to the competition commission for further consideration by march 28 2012 if the competition commission were to conclude that the acquisition results in a substantial lessening of competition it could require remedial action which could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on third parties for card issuing and processing services supporting our mastercard network fleet card products failure to maintain these contractual relationships upon acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card offerings customer retention and operating results 

some of our fleetcard products in north america are accepted in the mastercard merchant network pursuant to our contractual relationships with two issuing banks and two thirdparty processors in order to continue offering fleet cards accepted at mastercard network merchants we must maintain our contractual relationship with at least one issuing bank further unless we develop our own mastercardapproved processing capabilities we 

  

index to financial statements must continue to obtain processing services from at least one processor approved by mastercard with the capability to provide acceptable levels of reporting data for fleet operators generally these contracts have remaining terms of between seven months and five years and automatically renew from year to year unless either party provides notice of termination one of the two issuing banks has provided us with notice that it does not intend to automatically renew our agreement when it expires in 2012 we intend to replace this issuing bank our failure to maintain adequate relationships or find suitable alternatives could have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card products our customer retention and our operating results 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded fleet cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network fleet cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network fleetcard transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us and uk regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa and the uk bribery act such laws prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

index to financial statements risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our principal stockholders have a controlling influence over our business affairs 

our principal stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own or control directly or indirectly at june 30 2011 49589138 shares of our common stock which in the aggregate represents approximately 62 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result if some of these persons or entities act together they will have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election and removal of directors amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 

some of these persons or entities who make up our principal stockholders may have interests different from our other stockholders for example they may be more interested in selling fleetcor to an acquirer than other stockholders or may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods 

  

index to financial statements specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition our certificate of incorporation prohibits large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or consolidating with us except under certain circumstances these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 

we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

we currently expect to retain all future earnings if any for future operation expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our operating results financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in addition we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur

index to financial statements our segments sources of revenue and expenses 

segments 

we operate in two segments which we refer to as our north american and international segments the results from our mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher business acquired during the third quarter of 2011 are reported in our international segment our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue” for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 our north american and international segments generated the following revenue 

 

 sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions and the related revenue per transaction as illustrated in the diagram below a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners for whom we manage card programs revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as our customers and partners through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel vehicle maintenance food or lodging services to our customers we also earn revenue from our customers and partners through program fees and charges the following diagram illustrates a typical transaction flow 

illustrative transaction flow 

 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction as illustrated in the table below the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a “merchant commission” and is recognized as an expense approximately 445 and 474 of our revenue during 2011 and 2010 respectively was derived from our merchant and network relationships

 from our customers and partners we derive revenue from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and report fees our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk approximately 555 and 526 of our revenue during 2011 and 2010 respectively was derived from customer and partner program fees and charges 

transaction volume and revenue per transaction set forth below is revenue per transaction information for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

    

index to financial statements from 2010 to 2011 total transactions increased from 1904 million to 2148 million excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract in europe an increase of 244 million or 128 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north american and international segments excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract in europe primarily due to organic growth in certain payment programs and the impact of the acquisition of our mexican prepaid card company during the third quarter of 2011 and our acquisition of allstar business solutions allstar during the fourth quarter of 2011 this nonrenewed partner had a high number of transactions and very little revenue 

from 2009 to 2010 transactions increased from 1841 million to 1904 million excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract in europe an increase of 63 million or 34 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north american segment due primarily to the full year impact of our acquisition of clc group inc in april 2009 and organic growth in certain payment programs we experienced an increase in transactions in our international segment excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract in europe primarily due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2009 and new acquisitions in 2010 and organic growth in certain payment programs this nonrenewed partner had a high number of transactions and very little revenue 

revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates revenue per transaction per customer increases as the level of services we provide to a customer increases 

our consolidated revenue per transaction increased from 227 in 2010 to 242 in 2011 excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract in europe an increase of 015 per transaction or 66 our consolidated revenue per transaction was impacted by 

 

  

  

 during 2011 we completed the acquisition of a mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher company and allstar business solutions which together contributed to the increase in transaction volumes and revenues however the mexican and allstar businesses both produce lower aggregate consolidated revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses and when combined with our other businesses’ transactions and revenues results in a lower revenue per transaction than would have resulted without the acquisitions the results from our mexican and allstar businesses are reported in our international segment 

our consolidated revenue per transaction increased from 192 in 2009 to 227 in 2010 excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract in europe an increase of 035 per transaction or 182 our consolidated revenue per transaction was impacted by 

 

  

  

 during 2010 these positive impacts were partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar during 2010 relative to other foreign currencies which resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange rates that reduced our 2010 revenue per transaction 

  

index to financial statements the revenue per transaction in the international segment runs higher than the north america segment due primarily to higher margins and higher fuel prices in our international product lines 

north american segment revenue per transaction increased from 194 for the year ended december 31 2010 to 228 for year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 034 per transaction or 175 our north american segment revenue per transaction was impacted by

 international segment revenue per transaction decreased from 347 for the year ended december 31 2010 to 275 for year ended december 31 2011 a decrease of 072 per transaction or 207 our international segment revenue per transaction was positively impacted by 

 

  

  

 these positive impacts were offset by the impact of our international acquisitions during 2011 we acquired a mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher company and allstar business solutions which together contributed to the increase in transaction volumes and revenues in our international segment however the mexican and allstar businesses both produce lower aggregate revenue per transaction products in comparison to our other businesses and when combined with our other businesses’ transactions and revenues results in a lower revenue per transaction 

international segment revenue per transaction increased from 309 for the year ended december 31 2009 to 347 for year ended december 31 2010 an increase of 038 per transaction or 123 our international segment revenue per transaction was positively impacted by 

 

  

  

 during 2010 these positive impacts were partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar during 2010 relative to other foreign currencies which resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange rates as well as lower spread revenue due to the wholesale cost of fuel increasing at a faster rate than the retail price of fuel that reduced our 2010 revenue per transaction 

  

index to financial statements sources of expenses 

we incur expenses in the following categories 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 factors and trends impacting our business 

we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

 accounts receivable securitization 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility securitization facility in the ordinary course of our business to finance a portion of our accounts receivable prior to 2010 activity associated with our securitization facility was recorded offbalance sheet utilizing a qualified specialpurpose entity or qspe in the form of a limited liability company the qspe raised funds by issuing debt to thirdparty investors the qspe held trade accounts receivable whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the liabilities of the qspe investors only had recourse to the assets held by the qspe our involvement in these arrangements takes the form of originating accounts receivable and providing servicing activities 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset the concept of a qspe entity which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers is removed by this standard this guidance was effective for us as of january 1 2010 as a result of the adoption of such guidance we consolidated the qspe and the securitization of accounts receivable related to the qspe is accounted for as a secured borrowing rather 

  

index to financial statements than as a sale accordingly we record accounts receivable and shortterm debt related to the securitization facilities as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet in addition our statements of income no longer include securitization activities in revenue rather we report provision for bad debts and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued by the qspe in processing expense and interest expense net respectively on the consolidated statements of income 

as a result of the implementation of this guidance effective january 1 2010 we recorded a 2180 million increase in accounts receivable and a 2180 million increase in current liabilities see “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further details 

although bad debt and interest associated with our securitization facility were reported in revenue for periods prior to january 1 2010 we monitored these costs on a managed basis the following table presents for the year ended december 31 2009 certain statement of income items adjusted for the impact of the new accounting guidance described above related to our securitization facility 

 

 managed provision for bad debts as a percentage of gross billed revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 is as follows dollar amounts in millions 

 

  

 acquisitions 

during 2011 we acquired two companies which are described below the results of our mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher business and allstar business are included within our international segment from the date of acquisition 

 

  

   

index to financial statements  during 2010 we consummated three acquisitions which were not individually or in the aggregate material to our results of operations 

during 2009 we acquired three companies the two largest of which are described below the third acquisition is immaterial the results of clc group inc and its subsidiaries since the date of acquisition are included within our north american segment the results of operations for the remaining acquisitions are included in our international segment from their respective dates of acquisition

 international segment revenue 

international segment revenue increased from 1460 million in 2010 to 1708 million in 2011 an increase of 248 million or 170 the increase in international segment revenue was due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

  

 consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions increased from 491 million in 2010 to 512 million in 2011 an increase of 21 million or 43 this increase was due primarily to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel 

processing processing expenses increased from 697 million in 2010 to 845 million in 2011 an increase of 148 million or 212 during 2011 our processing expenses were primarily impacted by volume increases and a card conversion project in certain of our payment programs a onetime contract termination charge the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 

selling selling expenses increased from 327 million in 2010 to 366 million in 2011 an increase of 39 million or 119 the increase was due primarily to additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from 781 million in 2010 to 848 million in 2011 an increase of 67 million or 86 the increase was primarily due to additional public company costs during the period transaction related costs the impact of acquisitions completed during 2011 and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates partially offset by a decrease in noncash stock compensation expense related to our stock incentive plans 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 337 million in 2010 to 362 million in 2011 an increase of 25 million or 74 the increase was primarily attributable to the full year impact of acquisitions completed during 2010 as well as the impact of acquisitions completed in 2011 which resulted in an increase of 22 million related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets for customer and vendor relationships trade names and trademarks noncompete agreements and software as well as acquired fixed assets 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 1705 million in 2010 to 2263 million in 2011 an increase of 558 million or 327 our operating margin was 393 and 436 for 2010 and 2011 respectively the increase in operating income from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to organic growth in the business the impact of higher fuel prices higher fuel spread revenues the impact of acquisitions completed during 2011 organic growth in the business and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates these increases were partially offset by additional public company costs transaction related costs and additional costs to support the growth in our business 

  

index to financial statements additionally during 2011 we completed the acquisition of a mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher company and allstar business solutions which together contributed to the increase in consolidated operating income however the mexican business and allstar business both produce lower margin products in comparison to our other businesses and when combined with our other businesses’ operating income produced a lower margin than would have resulted without the acquisitions 

for the purpose of segment operating results we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north american segment operating income 

north american operating income increased from 1067 million in 2010 to 1537 million in 2011 an increase of 470 million or 440 north american operating margin was 371 and 441 for 2010 and 2011 respectively the increase in operating income from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to organic growth in the business the impact of higher fuel prices higher fuel spread revenues and less stock compensation expense related to our stock incentive plans these increases were partially offset by additional public company costs during 2011 compared to 2010 

international segment operating income 

international operating income increased from 638 million in 2010 to 726 million in 2011 an increase of 88 million or 138 international operating margin was 436 and 425 for 2010 and 2011 respectively the increase in operating income from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2010 and 2011 the impact of higher fuel prices and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates these increases were partially offset by additional amortization related to acquisitions completed during 2010 and 2011 transaction related costs and additional costs to support the growth in our business 

the lower operating margin was due to the mexican prepaid fuel card and food voucher company and allstar business solutions acquisitions which both produce lower margin products in comparison to our other businesses 

other income net 

other income net decreased from income of 13 million 2010 to 06 million in 2011 a decrease of 07 million or 553 the decrease was due primarily to lower foreign currency exchange gains recognized during 2011 

interest expense net 

interest expense net reflects the amount of interest paid on our 2005 credit facility ccs credit facility and new credit facility all of which are defined in “liquidity and capital resources” offset by interest income interest expense decreased from 205 million in 2010 to 134 million in 2011 a decrease of 71 million or 348 this decrease was primarily due to the expiration of an interest rate swap agreement which matured in november 2010 which resulted in interest expense of 60 million in 2010 the remaining decrease is due to the decline in interest rates on our credit facilities and lower term debt balances outstanding on our term loan facilities additionally during 2011 we paid down of our 2005 credit facility and ccs facility upon entry into our new credit facility on june 22 2011 the average interest rate including the unused credit facility fee on our new credit facility was 238 in the year ended december 31 2011 the average interest rate on the 2005 credit facility was 235 in 2011 compared to 475 in 2010 the average interest rate on the ccs credit facility was 266 in 2011 compared to 272 in 2010 

  

index to financial statements loss on early extinguishment of debt 

loss on early extinguishment of debt increased from zero in 2010 to 27 million in 2011 this increase is due to the writeoff of 17 million and 10 million in deferred debt issuance costs associated with the early extinguishment of the 2005 facility and ccs credit facility respectively upon retirement of these credit facilities with the proceeds from our new credit facility signed on june 22 2011 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 434 million in 2010 to 635 million in 2011 an increase of 201 million or 465 the increase from 2010 to 2011 was due primarily to an increase in our income before income tax and an increase in our effective tax rate from 287 in 2010 to 301 in 2011 the increase in our effective tax rate was due primarily to a onetime favorable reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions in 2010 which was not repeated in 2011 see also “note 11income taxes” for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective tax rate 

net income 

for the reasons discussed above our net income increased from 1079 million in 2010 to 1473 million in 2011 an increase of 394 million or 366

 during 2010 our consolidated revenue was negatively impacted by a range of factors including the strengthening of the us dollar during 2010 relative to other foreign currencies which resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange rates as compared to 2009 that reduced our revenue in 2010 by 10 million 

north american segment revenue

 international segment revenue 

international segment revenue increased from 1267 million in 2009 to 1460 million in 2010 an increase of 193 million or 152 during 2010 our international segment revenue was positively impacted by the following 

 

  

  

 during 2010 these positive impacts were partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar during 2010 relative to other foreign currencies that reduced our revenue in 2010 by 10 million and lower spread revenue due to the wholesale cost of fuel increasing at a faster rate than the retail price of fuel 

consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commission merchant commissions increased from 397 million in 2009 to 491 million in 2010 an increase of 94 million or 237 this increase was due primarily to the fluctuation of the margin between the wholesale cost and retail price of fuel and the impact of higher volumes in businesses where merchant commissions are paid 

  

index to financial statements processing processing expenses increased from 580 million in 2009 to 697 million in 2010 an increase of 117 million or 202 our processing expenses increased by 219 million as a result of the adoption of authoritative guidance related to our asset securitization agreement as further discussed in “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” this increase was offset by a decrease of 137 million for bad debt due to a lower percentage of uncollectible accounts 

selling selling expenses increased from 306 million in 2009 to 327 million in 2010 an increase of 21 million or 69 the increase was due primarily to additional sales and marketing spending in certain markets 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from 514 million in 2009 to 781 million in 2010 an increase of 267 million or 519 the increase was primarily due to a onetime compensation charge of 238 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 associated with our initial public offering and the vesting of restricted stock and stock options in connection with this liquidity event additional increases in expense are attributable to fees associated with procuring sarbanesoxley compliance and stock compensation expense related to the issuance of additional shares during the year 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from 284 million in 2009 to 337 million in 2010 an increase of 53 million or 187 an increase of 32 million was attributable to acquisitions completed during 2009 due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets related to customer and vendor relationships trade names and trademarks noncompete agreements and software in addition we recognized 16 million additional depreciation expense related to an increase in capital expenditures primarily as a result of additional investments to build and enhance our proprietary processing systems 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 1460 million in 2009 to 1705 million in 2010 an increase of 245 million or 168 our operating margin was 412 and 393 for 2009 and 2010 respectively the increase in operating income was due primarily to an increase in managed revenue less merchant commissions of 432 million and lower bad debt of 137 million these increases are offset by a 238 million onetime compensation charge in connection with our initial public offering and the vesting of restricted stock and stock options in connection with this liquidity event the decrease in operating margin from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to onetime compensation charge as discussed above 

for the purpose of segment operations we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north american segment operating income 

north american operating income increased from 917 million in 2009 to 1067 million in 2010 an increase of 150 million or 164 north american operating margin was 403 and 371 for 2009 and 2010 respectively the increase in operating income from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to an increase in transaction volumes and rate per transaction during 2010 compared to 2009 and lower bad debt expense in 2010 compared to 2009 partially offset by a onetime compensation charge in 2010 the decrease in operating margin is due to the onetime compensation charge in 2010 related to our initial public offering 

international segment operating income 

international operating income increased from 543 million in 2009 to 638 million in 2010 an increase of 95 million or 175 international operating margin was 429 and 436 for 2009 and 2010 respectively the 

  

index to financial statements increase in operating income and margin from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to the full year impact of acquisitions completed during 2009 organic growth in our rate per transaction during 2010 and lower bad debt expense in 2010 

interest expense net 

interest expense net reflects the amount of interest paid on our 2005 credit facility and ccs credit facility described below under the headings “2005 credit facility” and “ccs credit facility” respectively interest expense increased from 173 million in 2009 to 205 million in 2010 an increase of 32 million or 185 during 2010 our interest expense increased 53 million as a result of the adoption of authoritative guidance related to our asset securitization agreement as further discussed in “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” this increase was partially offset by lower average interest rates during 2010 than experienced during 2009 the average interest rate including the effect of interest rate derivatives on the 2005 credit facility was 475 in 2010 versus 525 in 2009 the average interest rate on the ccs credit facility was 272 in 2010 versus 394 in 2009 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 405 million in 2009 to 434 million in 2010 an increase of 29 million or 72 the increase from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to an increase in our income before income tax partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate from 313 in 2009 to 287 in 2010 the decrease in our effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the mix of earnings between the taxing jurisdictions where we do business and a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in nonus taxing jurisdictions are lower than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates see also “note 11income taxes” for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective tax rate 

net income 

for the reasons discussed above our net income increased from 891 million in 2009 to 1079 million in 2010 an increase of 188 million or 211 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness make acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

sources of liquidity 

at december 31 2011 our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance totaled 2852 million our restricted cash balance at december 31 2011 totaled 558 million restricted cash primarily represents customer deposits in the czech republic which we are restricted from using other than to repay customer deposits and which may not be deposited outside of the czech republic 

at december 31 2011 cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested is 2618 million all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries excluding restricted cash are available for general corporate purposes our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time we currently believe that funds generated from our us operations along with potential borrowing capabilities in the us will be sufficient to fund our us operations 

  

index to financial statements for the foreseeable future and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable transaction to fund our us operations however if at a future date or time these funds are needed for our operations in the us or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds we may be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds no assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof the tax consequences related thereto or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic fuel card receivables to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants within seven days of receiving the merchant billing as a result we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes or for acquisitions at december 31 2011 we had the ability to generate approximately 26 million of additional liquidity under our securitization facility and 475 million undrawn on our revolving credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt or equity securities we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for 2011 was 2796 million compared to 1398 million for 2010 the increase is primarily due to additional net income of 394 million and a decrease in working capital driven primarily by the increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and customer deposits of 1230 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 411 million 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 was 1398 million compared to 1788 million for 2009 the decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable of 413 million primarily due to organic growth and higher fuel prices partially offset by improved collections 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 3472 million in 2011 compared to 212 million in 2010 the increase in cash used in investing activities is attributable to the increase in cash used for acquisitions of 3237 million net of cash acquired net cash used in investing activities decreased to 212 million in 2010 from 2408 million in 2010 this decrease is due primarily to a reduction in cash used for acquisitions

index to financial statements the increase in cash provided by financing activities is attributable primarily to additional borrowings on the securitization facility of 1360 million in 2011 compared to payments on the securitization facility of 740 million in 2010 in addition on june 22 2011 we entered into a new fiveyear 900 million credit facility with a syndicate of banks which provided additional cash from financing activities during 2011 of 4250 million over the same period in 2010 proceeds from this new credit facility were used to retire our indebtedness under our 2005 credit facility and ccs credit facility during 2011 we made aggregate principal payments on the 2005 credit facility and ccs credit facility of 3300 million and seller financing payments of 16 million compared to aggregate principal payments of 246 million in 2010 during 2011 we made principal payments of 75 million on the term loan under our new credit facility 

net cash provided by financing activities decreased 1587 million from 722 million in 2009 resulting in cash used in financing activities in 2010 of 865 million the decrease in cash provided by financing activities resulted from the net proceeds received from the issuance of our series e preferred stock of 937 million in april 2009 in addition during 2010 we made principal payments on the securitization facility of 740 million this decrease was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 96 million in 2010 in connection with our initial public offering

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and presentation 

revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as from customers and partners we recognize revenue on fees generated through services to commercial fleets major oil companies and petroleum marketers and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following i we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the acceptability of the product ii we have no inventory risk do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the product or have any involvement in the product specifications iii we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for the product predominantly fuel and iv the amount we earn for our services is fixed 

through our merchant and network relationships we primarily provide fuel vehicle maintenance or lodging services to our customers we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction our net revenue consists of margin on fuel sales and fees for technical support processing communications and reporting the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as an expense when the transaction is executed we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the services have been provided to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we have entered into agreements with major oil companies and petroleum marketers which specify that a transaction is deemed to be captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records revenue is recognized on lodging and transportation management services when the lodging stay or transportation service is completed 

we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees report fees and other transactionbased fees which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed number of transactions processed or some combination thereof such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of thirdparty networks transaction fees and other transactionbased fees generated from our proprietary networks and thirdparty networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured card fees network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations in addition we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed 

  

index to financial statements accounts receivable 

as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a 500 million revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a revolving basis to fleetcor funding llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary in turn fleetcor funding llc sells without recourse on a revolving basis up to 500 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit fleetcor funding llc maintains a subordinated interest in the form of over collateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper on february 6 2012 we extended the term of the securitization facility to february 4 2013 

we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature 

fleetcor funding llc determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable subject to a maximum amount fleetcor funding llc retains a residual interest in the eligible receivables such that amounts payable in respect of such residual interest will be distributed to fleetcor funding llc upon payment in full of all amounts owed by fleetcor funding llc to the financial institutions 

in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity or qspe which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers is removed by this standard this guidance was effective for us as of january 1 2010 as a result of the adoption of such guidance we consolidated our qspe using the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of the qspe as prescribed by accounting standards update “asu” no 200917 and any corresponding elimination of activity between the qspe and us resulting from the consolidation on january 1 2010 we recorded a 218 million increase in total assets a 218 million increase in total liabilities and noncash financing activities of 218 million 

beginning january 1 2010 our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income no longer reflect activity related to our retained economic interests but instead reflect activity related to our securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt including interest expense fees generated from late payments provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense interest expense and provisions for losses on accounts receivable associated with the securitized accounts receivable are no longer included as a reduction from revenues net in the consolidated statement of income the cash flows from borrowings and repayments associated with the securitized debt are now presented as cash flows from financing activities our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2009 has not been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of asu nos 200916 and 200917 therefore current period results and balances will not be comparable to prior period amounts particularly with regard to accounts receivable the securitization facility provision for losses on accounts receivable interest expense and revenues net 

credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables 

we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers payments from customers are generally due within 14 days of billing we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible and removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency 

  

index to financial statements impairment of longlived assets and intangibles 

we test our other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenues and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows we determine the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally we perform our testing of the asset group at the businessline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

we completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinitelife intangible asset impairment test as of october 1 2011 goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and the impairment test consists of two steps as well as a qualitative assessment as appropriate we early adopted the provisions of asu 201108 as discussed below in “adoption of new accounting standards” and performed a qualitative assessment of certain of our reporting units before calculating the fair value of the reporting units in step 1 of the goodwill impairment test in this qualitative assessment we individually considered the following items for each reporting unit where we determined a qualitative analysis to be appropriate the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions limitations on accessing capital fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other developments in equity and credit markets industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets likelihood of disposal and whether there were any other impairment considerations within the business the overall performance of our share price in relation to the market and our peers and a quantitative stress test of the previously completed step 1 test from the prior year updated with current year results and future projections 

we completed step 1 of the goodwill impairment testing for certain of our reporting units in this first step the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon among other factors a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including unrecognized intangibles as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss 

we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management’s expectations for future revenue operating expenses ebitda capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate we discount the related cash flow forecasts using our estimated weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation the market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate multiples 

  

index to financial statements are derived by relating the value of guideline companies based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace to various measures of their earnings and cash flow such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate 

preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions significant changes in our forecasts the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 

at december 31 2011 we had goodwill of 8235 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we completed our most recent annual goodwill asset impairment test on october 1 2011 and determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of the carrying value no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with relevant authoritative literature income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date the realizability of deferred tax assets is also assessed 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets that are not believed to more likely than not be realized in the future we include any estimated interest and penalties on taxrelated matters in income taxes payable and income tax expense 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

we apply the relevant authoritative literature with respect to uncertainty in income taxes this guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained 

  

index to financial statements business combinations 

we have accounted for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income for significant acquisitions we obtain independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist in determining fair value goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and any liabilities assumed the estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition 

these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are included in operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses some of the 2008 and earlier acquisitions include additional contingent consideration related to future earnouts based on the growth of the market when the contingencies are resolved and additional consideration is distributable we will record the consideration issued as additional cost of the acquired company or goodwill the operating results of entities acquired are included in our consolidated statements of operation from the completion date of the applicable transaction 

stockbased compensation 

we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature stock options are granted with an exercise price estimated to be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting we have selected the blackscholes option pricing model for estimating the grand date fair value of stock option awards granted there are assumptions within the blackscholes option pricing model we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options we base the riskfree interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon us treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant we estimate the volatility of the share price of our common stock by considering the historical volatility of the stock of similar public entities in determining the appropriateness of the public entities included in the volatility assumption we consider a number of factors including the entity’s life cycle stage size financial leverage and products offered stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of awards for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 

awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting prior to our initial public offering the vesting of the shares granted in 2010 were contingent on the sale of our company or a public offering of our common stock subject to certain other conditions the vesting of the shares granted in 2011and 2010 are generally based on the passage of time performance or market conditions shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions ranging from one to six years the fair value of restricted stock shares based on performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock the fair value of restricted stock shares based on market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo option pricing model the riskfree interest rate and volatility assumptions used within the monte carlo option pricing model are calculated consistently with those applied in the blackscholes options pricing model utilized in determining the fair value of the stock option awards for performancebased restricted stock awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

  

index to financial statements prior to our initial public offering the grant date fair value was not readily available thus in connection with making our fair value estimates related to our stock option and restricted stock grants prior to our initial public offering we considered various factors including thirdparty equity transactions and certain commonly used valuation techniques we sold convertible preferred stock to third parties in 2005 2006 and 2009 in addition in 2007 we repurchased common stock and preferred stock from the holders at a negotiated price which we believe represented fair value these thirdparty transactions served as a basis for determining the fair value of our common stock at various dates in situations where we sold preferred stock that included conversion and dividend features we considered such features in those instruments and the fact that such instruments could not be freely traded in determining a fair value for our common stock generally we concluded that the fair value of our common stock was 10 to 25 less than the preferred stock at the date of such thirdparty transactions due to the features attributable to the preferred stock in periods prior to thirdparty transactions and in intervening periods subsequent to the thirdparty transactions we utilized various earnings and revenue multiples to estimate the fair value of our common stock or to serve as an additional factor in determining fair value finally we used information we obtained related to our acquisitions and the related determination of purchase prices for these acquisitions which were generally based on earnings multiples as additional data to help determine the fair value of our equity instruments 

we have continued to enhance our value through acquisitions and organic growth our thirdparty investors made their investments with the expectation that some form of liquidity event would occur in the future at values higher than their initial investments we have continued to evaluate and adjust the estimated fair value of our common stock based on our acquisition strategy organic growth changes in management and other environmental factors from june 2006 to december 2009 the estimated fair value of our common stock as adjusted for the two and one half for one stock split effected november 30 2010 as determined based on the factors noted above increased from 655 per share to 18 per share and from april 2009 to december 2009 the fair value of our common stock increased from 10 per share to 18 per share the factors we considered in connection with estimating the fair value of our common stock for the period from april 2009 through december 2009 were the consummation of our acquisitions of clc group inc and red fuel cards europe limited in april 2009 and august 2009 respectively these acquisitions—coupled with modest organic growth—contributed to increasing revenues and profitability measures during this period additionally in december 2009 we began to consider certain strategic alternatives including a liquidity event which resulted in us having further discussions with third parties regarding our enterprise value based on these factors we estimated the fair value of our common stock had increased significantly during the period from april 2009 through december 2009 we completed our initial public offering at december 15 2010 at a price of 23 per share 

adoption of new accounting standards 

off balance sheet arrangements 

prior to 2010 we utilized an offbalance sheet arrangement in the ordinary course of business to finance a portion of our accounts receivable our offbalance sheet activity utilizes a qualified specialpurpose entity or qspe in the form of a limited liability company the qspe raises funds by issuing debt to thirdparty investors the qspe holds trade accounts receivable whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the liabilities of the qspe investors only have recourse to the assets held by the qspe our involvement in these arrangements takes the form of originating accounts receivable and providing servicing activities 

in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset the concept of a qualified specialpurpose entity which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers is removed by this standard this guidance was effective for us as of january 1 2010 as a result of the adoption of such guidance we consolidated the qspe and the securitization of accounts receivable related to the qspe is accounted for as a secured borrowing rather than as a sale accordingly we recorded accounts receivable and shortterm debt related to the securitization facility as assets 

  

index to financial statements and liabilities on our balance sheet in addition subsequent to the adoption our statements of income no longer include securitization activities in revenue rather we report the provision for bad debts and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued by the qspe in processing expense and interest expense net respectively on the consolidated statements of income 

fair value measurements and disclosures 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 201006 “improving disclosures about fair value measurements” which amends accounting standards codification “asc” 820 “fair value measurements and disclosures” to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements relating to level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy this asu also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value this asu was effective for us beginning january 1 2010 except for the requirements to provide the level 3 activity of purchases sales issuance and settlements if any which were effective for us beginning january 1 2011 since asu 201006 is a disclosureonly standard its adoption had no impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

multiple revenue arrangements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued asu 200913 “multiple revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force” which supersedes certain guidance in asc 60525 “revenue recognitionmultiple element arrangements” and requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration to all of its deliverables at the inception of an arrangement based on their relative selling prices ie the relativesellingprice method the use of the residual method of allocation will no longer be permitted in circumstances in which an entity recognized revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverables subject to asc 60525 asu 200913 also requires additional disclosures we adopted the provisions of asu 200913 beginning on january 1 2011 based on our current revenue arrangements the adoption of asu 200913 did not have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

stock based compensation 

in april 2010 the fasb issued asu 201013 “compensationstock compensation topic 718—effect of denominating the exercise price of a sharebased payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force” asu 201013 addresses whether an entity should classify a sharebased payment award as equity or a liability if the award’s exercise price is denominated in the currency in which the underlying security trades and that currency is different from the 1 entity’s functional currency 2 functional currency of the foreign operation for which the employee provides services and 3 payroll currency of the employee under the existing guidance in asc 71810 “compensationstock compensation” we do not classify any of our stockbased compensation as liabilities asu 201013 was effective for the company beginning on january 1 2011the adoption of asu 201013 does not change our current accounting for its stockbased compensation awards as asu 201013’s application contains an exception for sharebased payments that like our’s use exercise prices denominated in the currency of the market in which substantial portions of the entity’s equity securities trade 

business combination pro forma information 

in december 2010 the fasb issued asu 201029 “business combinations asc topic 805 disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations” the amendments in this asu affect any public entity as defined by asc topic 805 that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis the amendments in this asu specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable 

  

index to financial statements prior annual reporting period only the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2010 early adoption is permitted the adoption of asu 201029 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

goodwill impairment testing 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 which gives entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step 1 of the goodwill impairment test if entities determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount the twostep impairment testing would be required otherwise further testing would not be needed this asu is effective for all entities for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we early adopted this guidance effective october 1 2011 for certain reporting units for purposes of our 2011 annual goodwill impairment testing the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations of cash flows 

comprehensive income presentation 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements the new guidance removes the presentation options in asc 220 and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either 1 a continuous statement of comprehensive income or 2 two separate but consecutive statements the asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income also the earnings per share computations will not change and will continue to be based on net income this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 we adopted the asu on december 31 2011 using two separate statements of income and comprehensive income 

goodwill with zero or negative carrying amounts 

in december 2010 the fasb issued asu 201028 which modifies step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts for those reporting units an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations because none of our reporting units have zero or negative carrying amounts 

pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

  

index to financial statements fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 “amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs” which amends asc 820 “fair value measurement” to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and international financial reporting standards the amendments in this update explain how to measure fair value they do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting the amendments are effective for us beginning january 1 2012 and are required to be applied prospectively with early adoption not permitted since asu 201104 is a disclosureonly standard its adoption will not affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 management’s use of nongaap financial measures 

any analysis of nongaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap we have included in the discussion under the caption “accounts receivable securitization” above a financial measure that was not prepared in accordance with gaap within this caption we define the nongaap financial measure provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

we have included in the discussion under the caption “transaction volume and revenue per transaction” above a financial measure that was not prepared in accordance with gaap below we define the nongaap financial measure provide a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 

  

index to financial statements revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed partner contract 

we have defined the nongaap measure revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract as revenues net as reflected in our income statement and segment footnote less the revenues net provided by the nonrenewed partner in the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 as applicable 

our management uses revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract along with other factors to evaluate our financial performance we believe that revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial performance and may be useful to investors because it provides a more complete understanding of our revenue performance of continuing business revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract is not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such 

set forth below is a reconciliation of revenues net excluding the impact of a nonrenewed contract to the most directly comparable gaap measure revenues net in thousands for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2011 management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2011 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework as of december 31 2011 management believes that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

in connection with management’s evaluation our management team excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 the internal controls relating to two subsidiaries that we acquired during the year ended december 31 2011 and for which financial results are included in our consolidated financial statements on august 31 2011 we acquired all of the stock of a prepaid fuel card and food voucher company in mexico mexican card and voucher company on december 13 2011 we acquired all of the stock of a fuel card company in the united kingdom uk fuel card company the mexican card and voucher company and uk fuel card company acquisitions represented 26 and 21 of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2011 and 25 and 1 of revenues and net income respectively for the year then ended this exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements 

  

index to financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

2010 2009 and 2008 respectively no single partner represented more than 10 of our consolidated revenue in these periods other than one partner chevron which represented approximately 11 of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2010

 competition 

we face considerable competition in our business the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service and account management and price we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors however we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to each of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

  

we compete with independent fleet card providers providers of card outsourcing services and major financial services companies as well as major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards we also compete with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house accounts as well as other forms of credit our primary independent fleet card competitors are wright express corporation comdata corporation and us bank voyager fleet systems inc in north america and arval uk group limited a subsidiary of bnp paribas internationally

regulatory 

a substantial number of laws and regulations apply to businesses offering payment cards to customers or processing or servicing such cards these laws generally apply only to consumer cards which are cards used to make purchases for personal family or household purposes because our payment cards are limited to purchases for business purposes only they are typically classified as commercial cards which are generally not subject to many of the laws and regulations applicable to consumer cards however our business is still subject to significant regulation and the following is a description of certain united states federal and state laws and regulations and certain laws and regulations of other jurisdictions applicable to our business

truth in lending act 

the truth in lending act or tila which is implemented by the federal reserve’s regulation z was enacted to increase consumer awareness of the cost of credit most provisions of regulation z apply only to the extension of “consumer” credit but a limited number of provisions apply to commercial cards including a provision providing that in cases where ten or more credit cards are issued by a card issuer for use by the employees of an organization the organization to which credit is extended may agree to liability imposed on the organization for unauthorized use without regard to regulation z limitations our cardholder agreements generally provide that the customer agrees that if it has been issued ten or more cards at its request then the customer waives to the fullest extent possible all limitations on liability for unauthorized use of the cards 

equal credit opportunity act 

the equal credit opportunity act which is implemented by the federal reserve’s regulation b prohibits creditors from discriminating when extending credit on certain “prohibited bases” such as an applicant’s sex race nationality and marital status and further requires that creditors disclose the reasons they took any adverse action against an applicant or a customer 

the fair credit reporting act 

the fair credit reporting act of 1970 or fcra regulates the disclosure and use of consumer reports by consumer reporting agencies we are permitted to obtain consumer reports with respect to an individual who guarantees or otherwise is obligated on a commercial card

we are subject to certain provisions of the currency and foreign transactions reporting act and the accompanying regulations issued by the us department of the treasury or the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 or the patriot act the patriot act contains a wide variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering among other things the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act requires financial services providers to establish antimoney laundering programs that meet certain standards including in some instances expanded reporting and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements we maintain antimoney laundering controls designed to prevent our network from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes other countries in which we operate have also enacted laws or regulations regarding antiterrorism and money laundering

in july 2010 president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the reform act the reform act is comprehensive in scope and contains a wide array of provisions intending to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets the focus of the reform act is consumer protection oriented our principal business in the united states however is business purpose charge cards which do not currently appear to be the focus of the reforms for instance among other matters the law creates a new independent consumer financial protection bureau which will regulate consumer credit across the us economy the bureau will have broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings payment and other consumer financial products and services it is unknown how this new bureau will exercise its authority many provisions of the reform act require the adoption of rules to implement proposed regulations have not been published accordingly the ultimate consequences of the reform act and its implementing regulations on our business results of operations and financial condition are uncertain at this time 

state usury laws 

some of our card products may be deemed to involve commercial purpose loans most state laws provide that money cannot be lent at an interest rate in excess of a certain statutory maximum this “usury limit” may act as a ceiling on interest to cardholders for the extension of credit these limits are often different for consumer cards and commercial cards because we have substantial operations in multiple jurisdictions and we utilize choice of law provisions in our cardholder agreements we have flexibility as to the laws of which jurisdiction to apply in addition the interest rates on certain of our card products are set based upon the usury limit of the cardholder’s state with respect to card products where we work with a partner or issuing bank the partner bank may utilize the law of the jurisdiction applicable to the bank and “exports” the usury limit of that state in connection with cards issued to residents of other states or we may use our choice of law provisions

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us if any of the following risks actually occur our business operating results financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected the risks discussed below also include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements see “note regarding forwardlooking statements” in this report 

risks related to our business 

a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount we believe that in 2010 approximately 191 of our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel in this annual report for the periods between january 1 2005 and december 31 2009 we refer to our consolidated revenue as adjusted for the impact of the new accounting guidance related to our securitization facility as our “consolidated revenue on a managed basis” for the periods prior to january 1 2005 we did not maintain a securitization facility changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

fuel prices are dependent on several factors all of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a portion of our revenue is derived from fuelprice spreads as a result a contraction in fuelprice spreads could adversely affect our operating results 

approximately 214 of our consolidated revenue in 2010 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuelprice spreads fuelprice spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant in transactions where we derive revenue from fuelprice spreads the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers or the fuel price we charge to our 

  

fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly when fuelprice spreads contract we generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results 

if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers we could experience an increase in credit loss 

we are subject to the credit risk of our customers many of which are small to midsized businesses we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are fraudulently completed changes in our industry and movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and as a result increased credit losses we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time further during a declining economic environment we experience increased customer defaults if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we derive a portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges or limitations on our fees and charges could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions cards reports late payments and optional services we derived approximately 526 of our consolidated revenue on a managed basis from these fees and charges during the year ended december 31 2010 if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity the extent to which they pay invoices late or their use of optional services our revenue could be materially adversely affected in addition several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts furthermore regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry’s pricing charges and other practices related to its customers any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we operate in a competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete effectively our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and competition could intensify in the future our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer our primary competitors in the united states are small regional and large independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms such as financial institutions that issue corporate and consumer credit cards and merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit our primary competitors in europe are independent fleet card providers major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers 

the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features network acceptance size customer service and account management and price we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently as a result a specific offering of our products and service features networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers’ preferences 

  

some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories greater brand name recognition larger customer bases more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources in addition our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions for example major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuelcard services as a complement to their existing card products and services as a result they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities standards or customer requirements to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories 

future mergers or consolidations among competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuelcard products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized nonfuelcardrelated products and services further larger competitors have reduced and could continue to reduce the fees for their services which has increased and may continue to increase pricing pressure within our markets 

overall increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase or a loss of market share we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our business is dependent on several key strategic relationships the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 

we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our “partners” during 2010 our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for approximately 22 of our consolidated revenue in the year ended december 31 2010 one partner chevron accounted for approximately 11 of our consolidated revenue two of our partners each represented greater than 5 of our consolidated revenue during 2010 our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from less than one year up to ten years 

the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies in our relationships with these major oil companies our services are marketed under our partners’ brands if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company we often must participate in a competitive bidding process which may focus on a limited number of factors such as pricing the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win this business the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

we depend in part on our merchant relationships to grow our business to grow our customer base we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships our business may be adversely affected 

a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers our new and enhanced product and service offerings and crossselling our products and services through existing merchant relationships we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue similarly our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closedloop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging our contractual agreements with fuel merchants typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a yeartoyear basis unless either party gives notice of termination our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a monthtomonth basis unless either party gives notice of termination furthermore merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy financial distress or otherwise be forced to contract their operations the loss of existing merchant relationships the contraction of our existing merchants’ operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results 

a decline in general economic conditions and in particular a decline in demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services would adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally both in the united states and internationally we generate revenue based in part on the volume of fuel purchase transactions we process our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions in the united states and europe and in particular the amount of business activity in these economies downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and consequently reduced purchasing of fuel and other vehicle products and services by businesses the recession in 2007 and 2008 negatively affected the organic growth of our business in 2009 which resulted from lower transaction volume from existing customers unfavorable changes in economic conditions including declining consumer confidence inflation recession or other changes may lead our customers which are largely comprised of commercial fleets to demand less fuel or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services these declines could result from among other things reduced fleet traffic corporate purchasing travel and other commercial activities from which we derive revenue 

further economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and as a result our reserve for credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable could increase in addition demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources 

we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states and europe as a result a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the united states or europe or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results 

we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past for example within the past several years we have entered into the lodging card business in the united states and now offer a limited telematics service to european customers we may continue to enter new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations if we are unable to do so our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

if we fail to develop and implement new technology products and services adapt our products and services to changes in technology or the marketplace or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology products and services are not successful we could lose customers and partners 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands which could jeopardize our competitive position in addition we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology products and services it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line 

our debt obligations or our incurrence of additional debt obligations could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely effect our financial performance 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 3138 million of longterm indebtedness outstanding in addition we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness subject to specified limitations our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness could have important consequences including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 

in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although our credit agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these 

  

restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and under certain circumstances the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if new debt is added to our existing debt levels the related risks that we will face would increase 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility which we must renew on an annual basis 

we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a specialpurpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers who finance their purchases through the issuance of shortterm commercial paper the securitization facility has a one year term during the financial crisis that began in 2008 the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility although we have been able to renew our securitization facility annually there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us 

a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs further we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business including our relationships with merchants customers and partners further we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest 

we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies 

as a result of our foreign operations we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 337 of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily czech koruna russian ruble and british pound revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into us dollars and as we expand we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely effect our financial condition 

we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the united states 

we have foreign operations in or provide services in belarus belgium canada the czech republic estonia ireland latvia lithuania luxembourg the netherlands pakistan poland the russian federation slovakia south africa ukraine and the united kingdom we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various countries in asia europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy 

some of the countries where we operate and other countries where we will seek to operate have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the united states in particular changes in laws or regulations including with 

  

respect to taxation information technology data transmission and the internet or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition in addition conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the united states these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and consequently our operating results further operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the united states we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 

we are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services 

our ability to process and authorize transactions electronically depends on our ability to communicate with our fuel lodging and vehicle maintenance providers electronically through pointofsale devices and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties in addition in order to process transactions promptly our computer equipment and network servers must be functional 24 hours a day which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by thirdparties and the availability of electricity which we do not control a severe disruption of one or more of these networks including as a result of utility or thirdparty system interruptions could impair our ability to authorize transactions and process information which could harm our reputation result in a loss of customers or partners and adversely affect our business and operating results 

we also utilize thirdparty providers to assist us with disaster recovery operations as a result we are subject to the risk of a provider’s unresponsiveness in the event of a significant breakdown in our computer equipment or networks furthermore our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

  

we may experience software defects system errors computer viruses and development delays which could damage customer relations decrease our profitability and expose us to liability 

our products and services are based on proprietary and thirdparty network technology and processing systems that may encounter development delays and could be susceptible to undetected errors viruses or defects development delays system errors viruses or defects that result in service interruption or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business damage our reputation and subject us to thirdparty liability in addition errors viruses and defects in our network technology and processing systems could result in additional development costs and the diversion of our technical and other resources from other development efforts or operations further our attempts to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitationofliability provisions in our agreements may not be successful 

we may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our fleet cards 

under certain circumstances when we fund customer transactions we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our fleet cards we do not maintain any insurance to protect us against any such losses 

we may not be able to adequately protect the data we collect about our customers and partners which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation 

we electronically receive process store and transmit our customers’ and partners’ sensitive information including bank account information and expense data we keep this information confidential however our websites networks information systems services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage disruption or misappropriation unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations 

because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation expose us to liability decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

we expect to expand through acquisitions which may divert our management’s attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties increased costs and dilution to our stockholders we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

we have been an active business acquirer both in the united states and internationally and as part of our growth strategy we expect to seek to acquire businesses commercial account portfolios technologies services and products in the future we have substantially expanded our overall business customer base headcount and operations both domestically and internationally through acquisitions the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses technologies products personnel or operations of the acquired business furthermore future acquisitions may 

 

  

  

  

   

in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 to complete a future acquisition we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capitalraising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities including potential acquisitions in addition we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions moreover we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition 

further an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges may require the amortization writedown or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation goodwill and other intangible assets or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs 

the market for fleetcard services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow 

our fleetcard businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow it could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services similarly growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally furthermore new technologies may displace fleet cards as payment mechanisms for fuel purchase transactions a decline in the acceptance and use of fleet cards and electronic payment transactions generally by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the market for our lodging cards is also evolving and that portion of our business is subject to similar risks 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results 

our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 536 of our total assets at december 31 2010 these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets under current accounting standards we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset while goodwill is not amortized on at least an annual basis we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired then it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights 

to protect our proprietary technology we rely on copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection despite our precautions it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states in addition our confidentiality agreements with employees vendors customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure 

protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive difficult and not always possible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our confidential information including trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others this litigation could be costly and divert management resources either of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information 

we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology moreover others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful even when our rights have been infringed furthermore effective patent trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services 

claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business 

third parties could claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property in addition to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties we may in the future receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights there may be thirdparty intellectual property rights including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies processes or business methods any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do furthermore a party making such a claim if successful could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services in addition we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party’s intellectual property which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all alternatively we might be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful 

third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf regardless of the merits of these claims because under certain conditions we agree to indemnify our customers from thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement if any of these claims succeed we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace the market for qualified individuals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 

changes in laws regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate 

the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the united states and internationally domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities which can be difficult to administer because of their scope mandates and varied requirements we are subject to a number of government regulations including among others interest rate and fee restrictions credit access and disclosure requirements collection and pricing regulations compliance obligations security and data breach requirements identity theft avoidance programs and antimoney laundering compliance programs government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection legislatures continue to consider whether to include business consumers within the scope of these regulations as a result new or expanded regulation focusing on business cardholders or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services in addition we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations including those related to state occupancy taxes value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions changes in tax laws or their interpretations could increase our tax liability further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries 

revenue from our lodging card business which we acquired on april 1 2009 equaled 369 million of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries therefore we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries for example unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business resulting in decreased revenue in addition mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base resulting in a smaller market for our products and services 

we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts 

in the course of our business we contract with government entities including state and local government fleet customers as well as federal government agencies as a result we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal state and local governments the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among private contracts in addition we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties 

  

litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties or requirements resulting in increased expenses 

we are not currently party to any legal proceedings or governmental inquiries or investigations that we consider to be material we are however subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business which if ultimately determined unfavorably could force us to pay damages or fines or change our business practices any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition we may become involved in various actions or proceedings brought by domestic and foreign governmental regulatory agencies in the event of alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations which could potentially subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restricting the conduct of our business we are currently involved in such an investigation by the office of fair trading in the united kingdom relating to our keyfuels product line this product line consists of our proprietary payment card and associated site network in the united kingdom a competitor alleged we are dominant in a relevant market with our keyfuels product line the office of fair trading is investigating whether we are dominant and if dominant whether some of our contracts with some sites and dealers would constitute exclusive dealings requiring them to be reformed to eliminate exclusivity the office of fair trading has issued a statement of objections which we are responding to although we do not currently anticipate an adverse result or material adverse impact from the investigation if determined adversely the regulator has authority to require us to reform contracts to eliminate exclusivity and impose significant fines 

we rely on third parties for card issuing and processing services supporting our mastercard network fleet card products failure to maintain these contractual relationships upon acceptable terms would have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card offerings customer retention and operating results 

some of our fleetcard products in north america are accepted in the mastercard merchant network pursuant to our contractual relationships with two issuing banks and two thirdparty processors in order to continue offering fleet cards accepted at mastercard network merchants we must maintain our contractual relationship with at least one issuing bank further unless we develop our own mastercardapproved processing capabilities we must continue to obtain processing services from at least one processor approved by mastercard with the capability to provide acceptable levels of reporting data for fleet operators generally these contracts have remaining terms of between three and five years and automatically renew from year to year unless either party provides notice of termination however one of the two issuing banks has provided us with notice that it does not intend to automatically renew our agreement when it expires in 2012 approximately 26 of our 2010 revenue was associated with this issuing bank we intend to replace this issuing bank if satisfactory arrangements to renew the contract are not concluded and we believe an alternative issuing bank can be found however our failure to maintain these relationships or find suitable alternatives could have an adverse effect on our mastercard network fleet card products our customer retention and our operating results 

changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue 

a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants known as interchange fees associated with transactions processed using our mastercardbranded fleet cards interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network fleet cards are affected by a number of factors including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard in addition interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network fleetcard transactions could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands it could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts our ability to continue to offer highquality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors in addition future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful 

failure to comply with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws associated with our international activities could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we may expand into certain foreign countries particularly those with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations including the united states foreign corrupt practices act or the fcpa such laws prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business we have implemented policies to discourage such practices however there can be no assurances that all of our employees consultants and agents including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate us laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and suspension or debarment from us government contracting which could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

our stock price will likely be volatile and may decline in value 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors some of which are beyond our control factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and regardless of the outcome could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management’s attention and resources 

our principal stockholders have a controlling influence over our business affairs 

our principal stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own or control directly or indirectly 54814868 shares of our common stock which in the aggregate represents approximately 69 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result if some of these persons or entities act together they will have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election and removal of directors amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 

some of these persons or entities who make up our principal stockholders may have interests different from our other stockholders for example they may be more interested in selling fleetcor to an acquirer than other stockholders or may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders 

future sales or the perception of future sales of a substantial amount of our common shares could depress the trading price of our common stock 

if we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our shares of common stock in the public market or if the market perceives that these sales could occur the market price of shares of our common stock could decline these sales may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equityrelated securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions 

we have 475 million shares of common stock authorized and at december 31 2010 had 79655213 shares of common stock outstanding of these shares 14576250 shares are freely tradable we our executive officers and directors and certain stockholders subject to certain limited exceptions have entered into agreements with the underwriters for our initial public offering not to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of our common stock until after june 12 2011 with certain exceptions immediately upon the expiration of this lockup period 15647786 shares will be freely tradable pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 by nonaffiliates and another 54274868 shares will be eligible for resale pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 subject to the volume manner of sale and other limitations of rule 144 

our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

beginning with our annual report for the year ended december 31 2011 section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or section 404 will require us to include a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting this report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the year and a statement as to whether or not our internal controls are effective our annual report for the year ended december 31 2011 must also contain a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting 

in order to achieve timely compliance with section 404 we have begun a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting our efforts to comply with section 404 have resulted in and are likely 

  

to continue to result in significant costs the commitment of time and operational resources and the diversion of management’s attention even if we develop effective controls such controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting market perception of our financial condition and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the new york stock exchange the securities and exchange commission the sec or other regulatory authorities and customer perception of our business may suffer 

furthermore implementing any appropriate changes to our internal control over financial reporting may entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems may take a significant period of time to complete and may distract our officers directors and employees from the operation of our business these changes however may not be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting and any failure to maintain that adequacy or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 

we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 

our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

   

in addition our certificate of incorporation prohibits large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or consolidating with us except under certain circumstances these provisions could discourage delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 

we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

we currently expect to retain all future earnings if any for future operation expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other things our operating results financial condition cash requirements contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant in addition we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur

we have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the sec that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2010 that remain unresolved 




 item 2 properties 

we lease all of the real property used in our business except as noted below the following table lists each of our material facilities and its location use and approximate square footage

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not currently party to any legal proceedings or governmental inquiries or investigations that we consider to be material we are and may become however subject to lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we are currently involved in an investigation by the office of fair trading in the united kingdom relating to our keyfuels product line this product line consists of our proprietary payment card and associated site network in the united kingdom a competitor alleged we are dominant in a relevant market with our keyfuels product line the office of fair trading is investigating whether we are dominant and if dominant whether some of our contracts with some sites and dealers would constitute exclusive dealings requiring them to be reformed to eliminate exclusivity the office of fair trading has issued a statement of objections which we are responding to although we do not currently anticipate an adverse result or material adverse impact from the investigation if determined adversely the regulator has authority to require us to reform contracts to eliminate exclusivity and impose significant fines

our segments sources of revenue and expenses 

segments 

we operate in two segments which we refer to as our north american and international segments our revenue is reported net of the wholesale cost for underlying products and services in this report we refer to this net revenue as “revenue” for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 our north american and international segments generated the following revenue 

 

 sources of revenue 

transactions in both of our segments we derive revenue from transactions and the related revenue per transaction as illustrated in the diagram below a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer our customers include holders of our card products and those of our partners for whom we manage card programs revenue from transactions is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as our customers and partners through our merchant and network relationships we primarily offer fuel vehicle maintenance or lodging services to our customers we also earn revenue from our customers and partners through program fees and charges the following diagram illustrates a typical transaction flow 

illustrative transaction flow 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction as illustrated in the table below the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a “merchant commission” and is recognized as an expense approximately 474 of our revenue during 2010 was derived from our merchant and network relationships 

  

illustrative revenue model for fuel purchases

 from our customers and partners we derive revenue from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees and report fees our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk approximately 526 of our revenue during 2010 was derived from customer and partner program fees and charges 

transaction volume and revenue per transaction set forth below is revenue per transaction information for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 from 2009 to 2010 transactions increased from 1932 million to 1961 million an increase of 29 million or 15 we experienced an increase in transactions in our north american segment due primarily to the full year impact of our acquisition of clc group inc in april 2009 and organic growth in certain payment programs we experienced a decrease in transactions in our international segment due to the wind down of a partner contract in europe inherited from an acquisition which we chose not to renew this partner had a high number of transactions and very little revenue this decrease in transactions was offset by the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2009 and new acquisitions in 2010 

from 2008 to 2009 transactions increased from 1893 million to 1939 million an increase of 46 million or 24 we experienced a decrease in transactions in our north american segment due primarily to a reduction in transactions by existing customers that we believe was a result of the economic downturn partially offset by our acquisition of clc group inc in april 2009 and organic growth in certain payment programs we experienced an increase in transactions in our international segment due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2008 and new acquisitions in 2009 

revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography the relevant merchant relationship the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions organic growth in our business and 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates revenue per transaction per customer increases as the level of services we provide to a customer increases the revenue per transaction in the international segment runs higher than the north america segment due primarily to higher margins and higher fuel prices in our international product lines international revenue per transaction has decreased from 2008 to 2009 in part due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of an acquisition completed in 2008 that carries a lower fee per transaction based on the relevant card products associated with this acquisition 

our consolidated revenue per transaction increased from 183 in 2009 to 221 in 2010 during 2010 our consolidated revenue per transaction was positively impacted by 

 

  

  

  

 during 2010 our consolidated revenue per transaction was negatively impacted by a range of factors including the strengthening of the us dollar during 2010 relative to other foreign currencies which resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange rates that reduced our 2010 revenue per transaction 

our consolidated revenue per transaction increased from 180 in 2008 to 183 in 2009 during 2009 our consolidated revenue per transaction was positively impacted by 

 

  

 during 2009 our consolidated revenue per transaction was negatively impacted by a range of factors including 

 

  

  

 sources of expenses 

we incur expenses in the following categories 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 factors and trends impacting our business 

we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 accounts receivable securitization 

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility in the ordinary course of our business to finance a portion of our accounts receivable our offbalance sheet activity utilizes a qualified specialpurpose entity or qspe in the form of a limited liability company the qspe raises funds by issuing debt to thirdparty investors the qspe holds trade accounts receivable whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the liabilities of the qspe investors only have recourse to the assets held by the qspe our involvement in these arrangements takes the form of originating accounts receivable and providing servicing activities accounts receivable that we sell under the securitization facility are reported in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with relevant authoritative literature trade accounts receivable sold under this program are excluded from accounts receivable in our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset the concept of a qspe entity which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers is removed by this standard this guidance was effective for us as of january 1 2010 as a result of the adoption of such guidance effective january 1 2010 we consolidated the qspe and the securitization of accounts receivable related to the qspe is accounted for as a secured borrowing rather than as a sale accordingly we record accounts receivable and shortterm debt related to the securitization facilities as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet in addition our statements of income no longer include securitization activities in revenue rather we report provision for bad debts and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued by the qspe 

as a result of the implementation of this guidance effective january 1 2010 we recorded a 2180 million increase in accounts receivable and a 2180 million increase in current liabilities see “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further details 

  

although bad debt and interest associated with our securitization facility were reported in revenue for periods prior to january 1 2010 we monitored these costs on a managed basis the following table presents certain statement of income items adjusted for the impact of the new accounting guidance described above related to our securitization facility 

 

 managed provision for bad debts as a percentage of gross billed revenue for the years ended december 31 is as follows dollar amounts in millions 

 

  

 acquisitions 

during 2010 we consummated three acquisitions which were not individually or in the aggregate material to our results of operations during 2009 we acquired three companies the two largest of which are described below the results of clc group inc and its subsidiaries since the date of acquisition are included within our north american segment the results of operations for the remaining acquisitions are included in our international segment from their respective dates of acquisition 

 

  

   

during 2008 we acquired four companies the three largest of which are discussed below the results of operations for these acquisitions are included in our international segment from their respective dates of acquisition

revenue 

our consolidated revenue increased from 3541 million in 2009 to 4338 million in 2010 an increase of 797 million or 225 during 2010 our consolidated revenue was positively impacted by the following 

 

  

  

  

 during 2010 our consolidated revenue was negatively impacted by a range of factors including the strengthening of the us dollar during 2010 relative to other foreign currencies which resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange rates as compared to 2009 that reduced our revenue in 2010 by 10 million 

north american segment revenue 

north american revenue increased from 2274 million in 2009 to 2878 million in 2010 an increase of 604 million or 266 the increase in our north american revenue was due primarily to 

 

  

  

  

 international segment revenue 

international segment revenue increased from 1267 million in 2009 to 1460 million in 2010 an increase of 193 million or 152 the increase in international segment revenue was due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

 the increase in international revenue was primarily offset by 

 

  

  

   

consolidated operating expenses 

general and administrative  general and administrative expense increased from 514 million in 2009 to 781 million in 2010 an increase of 267 million or 519 the increase was primarily due to a onetime compensation charge of 238 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 associated with our initial public offering and the vesting of restricted stock and stock options in connection with this liquidity event additional increases in expense are attributable to fees associated with procuring sarbanesoxley compliance and stock compensation expense related to the issuance of additional shares during the year 

merchant commission  merchant commissions increased from 397 million in 2009 to 491 million in 2010 an increase of 94 million or 237 this increase was due primarily to higher wholesale market spreads which impact merchant commissions as well as higher volumes in those revenue streams where merchant commissions are paid 

processing  processing expenses increased from 580 million in 2009 to 697 million in 2010 an increase of 117 million or 202 our processing expenses increased by 219 million as a result of the adoption of authoritative guidance related to our asset securitization agreement as further discussed in “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” this increase was offset by a decrease of 137 million for bad debt due to a lower percentage of uncollectible accounts 

selling  selling expenses increased from 306 million in 2009 to 327 million in 2010 an increase of 21 million or 69 the increase was due primarily to additional sales and marketing expense to increase sales production 

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization increased from 284 million in 2009 to 337 million in 2010 an increase of 53 million or 187 an increase of 32 million was attributable to acquisitions completed during 2009 due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets related to customer and vendor relationships trade names and trademarks noncompete agreements and software in addition we recognized 16 million additional depreciation expense related to an increase in capital expenditures primarily as a result of additional investments to build and enhance our proprietary processing systems 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income increased from 1460 million in 2009 to 1705 million in 2010 an increase of 245 million or 168 our operating margin was 412 and 393 for 2009 and 2010 respectively the increase in operating income was due primarily to an increase in managed revenue less merchant commissions of 432 million and lower bad debt of 137 million these increases are offset by a 238 million onetime compensation charge in connection with our initial public offering and the vesting of restricted stock and stock options in connection with this liquidity event the decrease in operating margin from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to onetime compensation charge as discussed above 

for the purpose of segment operations we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north american segment operating income 

north american operating income increased from 917 million in 2009 to 1035 million in 2010 an increase of 118 million or 129 north american operating margin was 403 and 360 for 2009 and 2010 respectively the increase in operating income from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to an increase in transaction volumes and rate per transaction during 2010 compared to 2009 and lower bad debt expense in 2010 compared to 

  

2009 partially offset by a onetime compensation charge in 2010 the decrease in operating margin is due to the onetime compensation charge in 2010 related to our initial public offering 

international segment operating income 

international operating income increased from 543 million in 2009 to 670 million in 2010 an increase of 127 million or 234 international operating margin was 429 and 459 for 2009 and 2010 respectively the increase in operating income and margin from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to the full year impact of acquisitions completed during 2009 organic growth in our rate per transaction during 2010 and lower bad debt expense in 2010 

interest expense net 

interest expense net reflects the amount of interest paid on our 2005 credit facility and ccs credit facility described below under the headings “2005 credit facility” and “ccs credit facility” respectively offset by interest income related to our securitization facility in accordance with the adoption of authoritative guidance related to our asset securitization agreement as further discussed in “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” interest expense increased from 173 million in 2009 to 205 million in 2010 an increase of 32 million or 185 during 2010 our interest expense increased 53 million as a result of the adoption of authoritative guidance related to our asset securitization agreement as further discussed in “note 2—summary of significant accounting policies” this increase was offset by lower average interest rates during 2010 than experienced during 2009 the average interest rate including the effect of interest rate derivatives on the 2005 credit facility was 548 in 2010 versus 513 in 2009 the average interest rate on the ccs credit facility was 213 in 2010 versus 381 in 2009 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 405 million in 2009 to 434 million in 2010 an increase of 29 million or 72 the increase from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to an increase in our income before income tax partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate from 313 in 2009 to 287 in 2010 the decrease in our effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the mix of earnings between the taxing jurisdictions where we do business and a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions including the us most us states and many nonus jurisdictions the tax rates in nonus taxing jurisdictions are lower than the us tax rate consequently as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions our effective tax rate fluctuates see also “note 11income taxes” for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the consolidated effective tax rate 

net income 

for all the reasons discussed above our net income increased from 891 million in 2009 to 1079 million in 2010 an increase of 188 million or 211

 the decrease in international segment revenue was partially offset by 

 

  

 consolidated operating expenses 

merchant commissions  merchant commissions increased from 385 million in 2008 to 397 million in 2009 an increase of 12 million or 31 this increase was due primarily to acquisitions completed during 2009 which added 62 million in expense partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 33 million and lower transaction volumes by existing customers which we believe were due to the economic downturn 

  

processing  processing expenses increased from 514 million in 2008 to 580 million in 2009 an increase of 66 million or 128 this increase was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed during 2009 of 77 million and an increase of 05 million for bad debt related to nonsecuritized accounts receivable due to a higher percentage of uncollectible accounts these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 million and lower servicing costs of 24 million due to operating efficiencies 

selling  selling expenses increased from 238 million in 2008 to 306 million in 2009 an increase of 68 million or 286 the increase was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed during 2009 of 35 million and additional sales and marketing expense of 41 million to increase sales production these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 07 million 

general and administrative  general and administrative expense increased from 476 million in 2008 to 514 million in 2009 an increase of 38 million or 80 an increase of 92 million was attributable to acquisitions completed during 2009 this increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 37 million and operating efficiencies that we believe reduced expenses by 22 million 

depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization increased from 273 million in 2008 to 284 million in 2009 an increase of 11 million or 40 an increase of 57 million was attributable to acquisitions completed during 2009 due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets related to customer and vendor relationships trade names and trademarks noncompete agreements and software this increase was partially offset by the impact of a contract that became fully amortized during 2008 and represented 59 million of additional amortization in 2008 

operating income and operating margin 

consolidated operating income 

operating income decreased from 1525 million in 2008 to 1460 million in 2009 a decrease of 65 million or 43 our operating margin was 447 and 412 for 2008 and 2009 respectively the decrease in operating income and margin from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to the impact of lower fuel pricespread revenue during 2009 relative to the higher than normal fuelprice spreads experienced during the second half of 2008 the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates in 2009 compared to 2008 lower average retail price of fuel in 2009 compared to 2008 and a decrease in transaction volumes as a result of the global economic downturn 

for the purpose of segment operations we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue similarly segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue 

north american segment operating income 

north american operating income increased from 883 million in 2008 to 917 million in 2009 an increase of 34 million or 39 north american operating margin was 430 and 403 for 2008 and 2009 respectively the increase in operating income from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to the impact of the clc acquisition which we completed in april 2009 and organic growth in our rate per transaction during 2009 compared to 2008 these factors were partially offset by lower fuelprice spread revenue in 2009 compared to 2008 due to higher than normal fuelprice spreads in the second half of 2008 a lower average retail price of fuel in 2009 compared to 2008 and a decrease in transaction volumes which we believe resulted from the economic downturn operating margin decreased from 2008 to 2009 due primarily to lower fuelprice spread revenue in 2009 as discussed above without a corresponding decrease in our operating expenses as a result the higher than normal revenues in 2008 increased operating margin in that year by approximately 3 

  

international segment operating income 

international operating income decreased from 642 million in 2008 to 543 million in 2009 a decrease of 99 million or 154 international operating margin was 473 and 429 for 2008 and 2009 respectively the decrease in operating income and margin from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange rates and lower transaction volumes as a result of the economic downturn these factors were partially offset by the impact of completed acquisitions during 2009 and the full year impact of the acquisitions completed during 2008 

other income net 

other income decreased from 25 million in 2008 to 09 million in 2009 a decrease of 16 million or 640 the decrease was due primarily to the reversal of a previouslyrecorded litigation reserve of 11 million in 2008 and losses on foreign currency transactions of 05 million in 2009 

interest expense net 

interest expense net reflects the amount of interest paid on our 2005 credit facility and ccs credit facility described below under the headings “2005 credit facility” and “ccs credit facility” respectively offset by interest income interest expense decreased from 203 million in 2008 to 173 million in 2009 a decrease of 30 million or 148 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 resulted from lower average interest rates during 2009 than experienced during 2008 the average interest rate including the effect of interest rate derivatives on the 2005 credit facility was 513 in 2009 versus 619 in 2008 the average interest rate on the ccs credit facility was 381 in 2009 versus 582 in 2008 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes increased from 374 million in 2008 to 405 million in 2009 an increase of 31 million or 83 the increase from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to an increase in our effective tax rate from 278 in 2008 to 313 in 2009 the increase in our effective tax rate was due primarily to the increase in valuation allowances on state net operating losses as of december 31 2009 we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately 530 million which are available to offset future state taxable income through 2021 a valuation allowance was made against our state net operating loss carryforwards the cumulative effect of which was recognized as an increase in tax expense of approximately 09 million for 2009 additionally part of the increase was due to acquisitionrelated costs which were expensed for accounting purposes but capitalized for tax purposes and the mix of earnings between domestic and foreign jurisdictions with differing tax rates 

net income 

for all the reasons discussed above our net income decreased from 973 million in 2008 to 891 million in 2009 a decrease of 82 million or 84 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness make acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios and meet working capital tax and capital expenditure needs 

sources of liquidity 

at december 31 2010 our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance totaled 1148 million our restricted cash balance at december 31 2010 totaled 623 million restricted cash represents customer deposits primarily in the czech republic which we are restricted from using other than to repay customer deposits and which may not be deposited outside of the czech republic 

  

we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic fuel card receivables to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants within seven days of receiving the merchant billing as a result we utilize the asset securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances these balances are primarily composed of charge balances which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly semimonthly or monthly basis and are generally required to be paid within 30 days of billing we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and 2005 credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes or for acquisitions at december 31 2010 we had the ability to generate approximately 1082 million of additional liquidity under our securitization facility and 500 million available under the 2005 credit facility 

based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions we believe that our current cash balances our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months however we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations commitments capital requirements and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future either through the issuance of debt and equity securities or otherwise we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities for 2010 was 1398 million compared to 1788 million for 2009 the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in working capital driven mainly by an increase in accounts receivable of 413 million due primarily from organic growth and higher fuel prices partially offset by improved collections 

net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 was 1788 million compared to 581 million for 2008 this improvement is attributable primarily to working capital improvements of 1028 million driven mainly by an increase in accounts payable due to timing of yearend merchant payables interest and income tax and improved collection on accounts receivable and an increase in prepaid expenses related to timing of purchases that contributed approximately 243 million year over year these increases were partially offset by lower net income of 82 million

937 million in april 2009 in addition during 2010 we made principal payments on the securitization facility of 740 million this decrease was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 96 million in 2010 in connection with our initial public offering

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis in many instances however we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and presentation 

revenue is derived from our merchant and network relationships as well as from customers and partners we recognize revenue on fees generated through services to commercial fleets major oil companies and petroleum marketers and record revenue net of the wholesale cost of the underlying products and services based on the following i we are not the primary obligor in the fuel arrangement and we are not responsible for fulfillment and the acceptability of the product ii we have no inventory risk do not bear the risk of product loss and do not make any changes to the fuel or have any involvement in the product specifications iii we do not have significant latitude with respect to establishing the price for fuel and iv the amount we earn for our services is fixed 

through our merchant and network relationships we provide fuel vehicle maintenance or lodging services to our customers we derive revenue from our merchant and network relationships based on the difference between the price charged to a customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction our net revenue consists of margin on fuel sales and fees for technical support processing communications and reporting the price paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as i the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup ii the transaction purchase price less a percentage discount or iii the transaction purchase price less a fixed fee per unit the difference between the price we pay to a merchant and the merchant’s wholesale cost for the underlying products and services is considered a merchant commission and is recognized as an expense when the transaction is executed we recognize revenue from merchant and network relationships when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the services have been provided to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we have entered into agreements with major oil companies and petroleum marketers which specify that a transaction is deemed to be 

  

captured when we have validated that the transaction has no errors and have accepted and posted the data to our records revenue is recognized on lodging and transportation management services when the lodging stay or transportation service is completed 

we also derive revenue from customers and partners from a variety of program fees including transaction fees card fees network fees report fees and other transactionbased fees which typically are calculated based on measures such as percentage of dollar volume processed number of transactions processed or some combination thereof such services are provided through proprietary networks or through the use of thirdparty networks transaction fees and other transactionbased fees generated from our proprietary networks and thirdparty networks are recognized at the time the transaction is captured card fees network fees and program fees are recognized as we fulfill our contractual service obligations in addition we recognize revenue from late fees and finance charges such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed 

accounts receivable 

as described above under the heading “securitization facility” we maintain a 500 million revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility we transfer certain of our domestic receivables on a revolving basis to fleetcor funding llc a whollyowned bankruptcy remote subsidiary in turn fleetcor funding llc sells without recourse on a revolving basis up to 500 million of undivided ownership interests in this pool of accounts receivable to a multiseller assetbacked commercial paper conduit fleetcor funding llc maintains a subordinated interest in the form of over collateralization in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highlyrated commercial paper on february 24 2011 we extended the term of the securitization facility to february 23 2012 

we utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions at market rates which approximates our cost of servicing we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement the residual interest’s fair value approximates carrying value due to its shortterm nature 

fleetcor funding llc determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable subject to a maximum amount fleetcor funding llc retains a residual interest in the eligible receivables transferred to the trust such that amounts payable in respect of such residual interest will be distributed to fleetcor funding llc upon payment in full of all amounts owed by fleetcor funding llc to the financial institutions 

in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity or qspe which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers is removed by this standard this guidance is effective for us as of january 1 2010 as a result of the adoption of such guidance effective january 1 2010 we consolidated our qspe using the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of the qspe as prescribed by asu no 200917 and any corresponding elimination of activity between the qspe and us resulting from the consolidation on january 1 2010 we recorded a 218 million increase in total assets a 218 million increase in total liabilities and noncash financing activities of 218 million beginning january 1 2010 our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income no longer reflect activity related to our retained economic interests but instead reflect activity related to our securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt including interest income fees generated from late payments provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense interest expense and provisions for losses on accounts receivable associated with the securitized accounts receivable are no longer included as a deduction from revenues net in the consolidated statement of income the cash flows from borrowings and repayments associated with the 

  

securitized debt are now presented as cash flows from financing activities our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2009 has not been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of asu nos 200916 and 200917 therefore current period results and balances will not be comparable to prior period amounts particularly with regard to accounts receivable securitization facility provision for losses on accounts receivable interest expense and revenues net 

credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables 

we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible and removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a thirdparty collection agency 

impairment of longlived assets and intangibles 

we test our other longlived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance we evaluate whether impairment indicators related to our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets are present these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset or asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition or a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group if impairment indicators are present we estimate the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount the cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of revenue and expenses working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows we determine the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and we record an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group generally we perform testing of the asset group at the businessline level as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value impairment may be present our approach to estimating the fair value of the equity of the reporting units is based on the income approach the income approach involves a discounted cash flow analysis for each of the reporting units estimates critical to our fair value estimates include the discount rate projected average revenue growth and financial performance of the reporting unit the discount rate is based on guideline companies that operate in the same industry as the reporting units and face similar risks in the market 

we measure the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets and estimate the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

we also evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names for impairment annually we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is below its carrying amount estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate royalty rates used in our evaluation 

  

of trade names projected average revenue growth and projected longterm growth rates in the determination of terminal values an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with relevant authoritative literature income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date the realizability of deferred tax assets must also be assessed 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences became deductible a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets that are not believed to more likely than not be realized in the future we include any estimated interest and penalties on taxrelated matters in income taxes payable and income tax expense 

we do not provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states in accordance with relevant authoritative literature if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future additional tax provisions may be required 

we apply the relevant authoritative literature with respect to uncertainty in income taxes this guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under the relevant authoritative literature the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained 

business combinations 

we have accounted for business combinations under the purchase method of accounting the cost of each acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when and if information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted should information become available after the allocation period those items are included in operating results the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses in 2009 prior to 2009 the costs of an enterprise acquired in a business combination included the direct cost of the acquisition a portion of our 2008 and earlier acquisitions include additional contingent consideration related to future earnouts based on the growth of the market when the contingencies are resolved and additional consideration is distributable we will record the consideration issued as additional cost of the acquired company or goodwill the operating results of entities acquired are included in our consolidated statements of operation from the completion date of the applicable transaction goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and any liabilities assumed 

  

stockbased compensation 

we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature which requires companies to recognize compensation cost for stock options and other stockbased awards based on the estimated fair value as measured on the grant date we have selected the blackscholes model for estimating the grant date fair value of sharebased payments stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of awards for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered for performancebased restricted stock awards we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

in connection with making our fair value estimates related to our stock option and restricted stock grants we considered various factors including thirdparty equity transactions and certain commonly used valuation techniques we sold convertible preferred stock to third parties in 2005 2006 and 2009 in addition in 2007 we repurchased common stock and preferred stock from the holders at a negotiated price which we believe represented fair value these thirdparty transactions served as a basis for determining the fair value of our common stock at various dates in situations where we sold preferred stock that included conversion and dividend features we considered such features in those instruments and the fact that such instruments could not be freely traded in determining a fair value for our common stock generally we concluded that the fair value of our common stock was 10 to 25 less than the preferred stock at the date of such thirdparty transactions due to the features attributable to the preferred stock in periods prior to thirdparty transactions and in intervening periods subsequent to the thirdparty transactions we utilized various earnings and revenue multiples to estimate the fair value of our common stock or to serve as an additional factor in determining fair value finally we used information we obtained related to our acquisitions and the related determination of purchase prices for these acquisitions which were generally based on earnings multiples as additional data to help determine the fair value of our equity instruments 

we have continued to enhance our value through acquisitions and organic growth our thirdparty investors made their investments with the expectation that some form of liquidity event would occur in the future at values higher than their initial investments we have continued to evaluate and adjust the estimated fair value of our common stock based on our acquisition strategy organic growth changes in management and other environmental factors from june 2006 to december 2009 the estimated fair value of our common stock as adjusted for the two and one half for one stock split effected november 30 2010t as determined based on the factors noted above increased from 655 per share to 18 per share and from april 2009 to december 2009 the fair value of our common stock increased from 10 per share to 18 per share the factors we considered in connection with estimating the fair value of our common stock for the period from april 2009 through december 2009 were the consummation of our acquisitions of clc group inc and red fuel cards europe limited in april 2009 and august 2009 respectively these acquisitions—coupled with modest organic growth—contributed to increasing revenues and profitability measures during this period additionally in december 2009 we began to consider certain strategic alternatives including a liquidity event which resulted in us having further discussions with third parties regarding our enterprise value based on these factors we estimated the fair value of our common stock had increased significantly during the period from april 2009 through december 2009 the company completed its initial public offering at december 15 2010 at a price of 23 per share 

recent accounting pronouncements 

off balance sheet arrangements 

prior to 2010 we utilized an offbalance sheet arrangement in the ordinary course of business to finance a portion of our accounts receivable our offbalance sheet activity utilizes a qualified specialpurpose entity or qspe in the form of a limited liability company the qspe raises funds by issuing debt to thirdparty investors the qspe holds trade accounts receivable whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the 

  

liabilities of the qspe investors only have recourse to the assets held by the qspe our involvement in these arrangements takes the form of originating accounts receivable and providing servicing activities 

in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset may be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset the concept of a qualified specialpurpose entity which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers is removed by this standard this guidance was effective for us as of january 1 2010 as a result of the adoption of such guidance effective january 1 2010 we consolidated the qspe and the securitization of accounts receivable related to the qspe is accounted for as a secured borrowing rather than as a sale accordingly we recorded accounts receivable and shortterm debt related to the securitization facility as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet in addition subsequent to the adoption our statements of income no longer include securitization activities in revenue rather we report a provision for bad debts and interest expense associated with the debt securities issued by the qspe

item 7a quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

our international segment exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that can impact translations of foreigndenominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies revenue from our international segment was 337 358 and 398 of total revenue for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we measure foreign currency exchange risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis measures the potential change in earnings based on a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2010 were used to perform the sensitivity analysis such analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated pretax income during the year ended december 31 2010 by approximately 68 million had the us dollar exchange rate increased or decreased relative to the currencies to which we had exposure when exchange rates and currency positions as of december 31 2009 and 2008 were used to perform this sensitivity analysis the analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in currency exchange rates would have increased or decreased consolidated pretax income for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 by approximately 54 million and 77 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt we invest our excess cash either to pay down our securitization facility debt or in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes under the 2005 credit facility we have a syndicated 3000 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of term loan b investors in the united states the term loan bears interest at our election at the prime rate or libor plus a margin based on our leverage position as of december 31 2010 the interest rate on the term loan was libor plus 225 the term loan expires in april 2013 

under the 2005 credit facility we also have a 50 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks based in the united states and europe the facility expires in april 2012 and borrowings bear a variable interest rate based at the prime rate or libor plus a margin that varies according to our leverage position as of december 31 2010 there were no borrowings on this facility 

in addition we have an 838 million term loan under our ccs credit facility this term loan bears interest on a base rate pribor plus a margin and mandatory cost 

based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt exclusive of our asset securitization facility at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 if market interest rates had increased or decreased an average of 100 basis points after considering the effect of our interest rate swap our interest expense would have changed by 19 million and 17 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreement these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

fuel price risk 

our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel accordingly our revenue is affected by fuel prices which are subject to significant volatility a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a change in our revenue from several sources including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer’s total purchase changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts the impact of changes in fuel price is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s 

  

cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price we do not enter into any fuel price derivative instruments 

fuelprice spread risk 

from our merchant and network relationships we derive revenue from the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant or network for the same transaction the price paid to a merchant or network is calculated as the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel plus a markup the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including among others the factors described above affecting fuel prices the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including among others the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices we experience fuelprice spread contraction when the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant’s wholesale cost of fuel accordingly if fuelprice spreads contract we may generate less revenue which could adversely affect our operating results the impact of volatility in fuel spreads is somewhat mitigated by our agreements with certain merchants where the price paid to the merchant is equal to the lesser of the merchant’s cost plus a markup or a percentage of the transaction purchase price
