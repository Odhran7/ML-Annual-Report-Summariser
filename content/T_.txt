areas of focus 

the importance of worldclass connectivity and content come together in our three market focus areas 5g fiber and hbo max fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver both wired and wireless building on that fiber foundation is our solid spectrum portfolio strengthened through recent federal communications commission fcc auction acquisitions and 5g deployment we believe our hybrid fixed and mobile approach will differentiate our services and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future as bandwidth demands continue to grow with usergenerated content growing at an everincreasing pace with hbo max we’ve developed a nextgeneration entertainment distribution platform built for growth in directtoconsumer subscription and advertisingbased relationships we will continue to demonstrate our commitment to ensure management attention is sharply focused on growth areas and operational efficiencies 

communications 

our integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms to provide instant connectivity at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements streaming augmented reality “smart” technologies and user generated content is expected to drive greater demand for broadband and capitalize on our fiber and 5g deployments during 2022 we will continue to develop and provide highvalue integrated mobile and broadband solutions 

wireless service we are experiencing rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet the deployment of 5g which allows for faster connectivity lower latency and greater bandwidth requires modifications of existing cell sites to add equipment supporting new frequencies like the cband and the newly auctioned 345 ghz band our 5g service went nationwide in july 2020 and with that availability the introduction of 5g handsets and devices has contributed to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades the increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5g technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services in january 2022 we began to deploy our cband spectrum subject to certain voluntary limitations 

in north america our network covers over 434 million people with 4g lte and over 250 million with 5g technology in the united states our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 330 million people with our lte technology and more than 250 million people with our 5g technology our 3g network provides services to customers using older handsets and connected devices we will discontinue services on our 3g network on february 22 2022 and expect to redeploy that spectrum in our transition to 5g as of december 31 2021 about 1 percent of our postpaid subscribers were using 3g handsets and we expect them to transition to newer technologies we do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 

as the wireless industry has matured future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services on a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations we continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our longterm needs we participate in fcc spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services 

broadband technology in 2020 we identified fiber as a core priority for our business working to expand our footprint and accelerating our historical rate of customer growth at december 31 2021 we had nearly 6 million fiber broadband customers adding more than 1 million during the year the expansion builds on our recent years’ investment to convert to a softwarebased network managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology softwarebased technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network sdn and network function virtualization nfv this network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of nextgeneration technology over the traditional hardwareintensive network approach our virtualized network is able to support nextgeneration applications like 5g and broadbandbased services quickly and efficiently 



media 

we produce and distribute highquality video content to take advantage of growing global demand our media businesses use their strong brands distinctive intellectual property and global scale to produce and distribute quality content as the television industry continues to evolve from a distribution system using satellite and cable offerings to internet streaming video services we are wellpositioned to address and capitalize on these changes but we face financial risks and new sources of competition associated with these developments in 2022 we plan to continue providing more personalized services offered directly to consumers through our own distribution and distribution partner channels including expanding our streaming platform hbo max in certain international territories att customers in the us that are on certain mobile and broadband plans can bundle with hbo max included at no additional charge 

latin america 

we believe that the wireless model in the us with accelerating demand for mobile internet service and the associated economic benefits will be repeated around the world as companies invest in highspeed mobile networks we acquired mexican wireless operations in 2015 to establish a seamless crossborder north american wireless network which now covers an area with over 434 million people and businesses in the united states and mexico with the increased capacity from our lte network we also expect additional wholesale revenue in the coming years our 4g lte network in mexico now covers approximately 104 million people and businesses

additional information on our geographical distribution of revenues is contained in note 4 of item 8 

government regulation 

wireless communications providers in the united states must be licensed by the fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fcc’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the highquality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically ten years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services 

the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of our satellite services which are licensed by the fcc and some of warnermedia’s businesses are also subject to obligations under the communications act and related fcc regulations we continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize andor moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all ipbased networks at the same time we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services which are subject to vigorous competition 



our ilec subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services including local longdistance and network access services provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings in addition many states have adopted legislation that enables us to provide ipbased video service through a single statewide or stateapproved franchise to offer a competitive video product these subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to intercarrier compensation interconnection and interstate and international rates and services including interstate access charges access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers 

our subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided 

the following discussion highlights significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations 

communications segment 

wireless 

the industrywide deployment of 5g technology which is needed to meet exploding demand for wireless data involves modifications of existing cell sites to add equipment supporting new frequencies like the cband and the newly auctioned 345 ghz band increasing the importance of local permitting processes that allow for approving those modifications on reasonable timelines and terms in june and november 2020 the fcc issued a declaratory ruling clarifying the limits on state and local authority to deny applications to modify existing structures to accommodate wireless facilities those clarifications facilitate quicker deployment of nextgeneration wireless equipment and services the fcc order was appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals where it remains pending following multiple requests by the fcc to hold the appeal in abeyance until the senate confirms a fifth fcc commissioner in addition to date 31 states and puerto rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment 

in march 2020 the fcc released its order setting rules for certain spectrum bands cband for 5g operations in that order the fcc concluded that cband 5g services that met the agency’s technical limits on power and emissions would not cause harmful interference with aircraft operations in reliance on that order att bid a total of 23406 and was awarded 1621 cband licenses including 40 mhz nationwide available for deployment in december 2021 with the remainder available for deployment in december 2023 in late 2021 the federal aviation administration faa questioned whether the cband launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes which operate on spectrum bands over 400 mhz away from the spectrum att is launching in 2022 in response to allow the faa more time to evaluate att and verizon delayed their planned december 2021 5g cband launch by six weeks and voluntarily committed to a series of temporary precautionary measures in addition to deferring turning on a limited number of towers around certain airports on january 19 2022 we launched 5g cband services subject to these voluntary temporary measures 

internet 

in february 2015 the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to title ii of the communications act the order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fcc’s authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements in december 2017 the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization on october 1 2019 the dc circuit issued a unanimous opinion upholding the fcc’s reclassification of broadband as an information service and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality because no party sought supreme court review of the dc circuit’s decision to uphold the fcc’s classification of broadband as an information service that decision is final while the court vacated the fcc’s express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality it stressed that its ruling did not prevent the fcc or isps from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the fcc’s regulatory objectives and framework the court also remanded the matter to the fcc for further consideration of the impact of reclassifying broadband services as information services on public safety the lifeline program and pole attachment regulation in october 2020 the fcc adopted an order concluding that those issues did not justify reversing its decision to reclassify broadband services as information services an appeal of the fcc’s remand decision is pending 



following the fcc’s 2017 decision to reclassify broadband internet access services as information services a number of states adopted legislation to reimpose the very rules the fcc repealed in some cases state legislation imposes requirements that go beyond the fcc’s february 2015 order additionally some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements suits have been filed concerning laws in california and vermont both lawsuits were stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals of the fcc’s december 2017 order because that order is now final the california suit returned to active status but the vermont litigation remained stayed pending resolution of a request in the california suit to enjoin enforcement of the california legislation pending resolution of the california litigation in january 2021 a us district court in california denied that request and as a consequence the california statute now is in effect the trade associations challenging the statute have appealed the denial of their request for preliminary injunction to the ninth circuit which reached a decision denying that appeal on january 28 2022 on february 11 2022 the trade association filed a petition for rehearing with the ninth circuit as a consequence the agreement of vermont and the other parties to the vermont lawsuit to stay that litigation will continue until the ninth circuit appeal is resolved or april 15 2022 whichever is earlier we expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet 

on november 15 2021 president biden signed the infrastructure investment and jobs act iija into law the legislation appropriates 65000 to support broadband deployment and adoption the national telecommunications and information agency ntia is responsible for distributing more than 48000 of this funding including 42500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas ntia will establish rules for this program in the first half of 2022 the iija also appropriated 14200 for establishment of the affordable connectivity program acp an fccadministered monthly lowincome broadband benefit program replacing the emergency broadband benefit program established in december 2020 by the consolidated appropriations act 2021 qualifying customers can receive up to thirty dollars per month or seventyfive dollars per month for those on tribal lands to assist with their internet bill att is a participating provider in the acp program and will consider participating in the deployment program where appropriate the iija includes various provisions that will result in fcc proceedings regarding acp program administration and consumer protection reform of the existing universal support program and broadband labeling and equal access 

privacyrelated legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions legislative regulatory and litigation actions could result in significant penalties increased costs of compliance further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data 

warnermedia segment 

warnermedia creates owns and distributes intellectual property including copyrights trademarks and licenses of intellectual property to protect its intellectual property warnermedia relies on a combination of laws and license agreements outside the us laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country the european union is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives which could impact warnermedia’s activities in the eu piracy particularly of digital content continues to threaten revenues from warnermedia’s products and services as well as revenues from our pay tv business and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including technological and legislative solutions outside the us various laws and regulations as well as trade agreements with the us also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in theaters and on broadcast and cable networks for example in certain countries including china laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year

importance duration and effect of licenses 

certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business many of our subsidiaries also hold governmentissued licenses or franchises to provide wireline satellite or wireless services additional information relating to regulation affecting those rights is contained under the heading “operating environment overview” of item 7 we actively pursue patents trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the united states and abroad we maintain a significant global portfolio of patents trademarks and service mark registrations we have also entered into agreements that permit other companies in exchange for fees and rights and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to utilize certain of our patents trademarks and service marks as we transition our network from a switchbased network to an ip softwarebased network we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers 

we periodically receive offers from third parties to obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also receive notices asserting that our products or services sold to customers or softwarebased network functions infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly such as network functions or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers such as wireless handsets could require us to pay damages royalties stop offering the relevant products or services andor cease network functions or other activities while the outcome of any litigation is uncertain we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or nonrenewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

competition continues to increase for communications media entertainment and digital services from traditional and nontraditional competitors technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available in addition lack of or a reduced level of regulation of comparable legacy services has lowered costs for alternative communications service providers as a result we face continuing competition as well as some new opportunities in significant portions of our business 

wireless we face substantial competition in our wireless businesses under current fcc rules multiple licensees who provide wireless services on the cellular pcs advanced wireless services 700 mhz and other spectrum bands may operate in each of our us service areas our competitors include two national wireless providers a larger number of regional providers and resellers of those services and certain cable companies in addition we face competition from providers who offer voice text messaging and other services as applications on data networks we are one of four facilitiesbased providers in mexico retail and wholesale with the most significant market share controlled by américa móvil we may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services while some of these technologies and services are now operational others are being developed or may be developed we compete for customers based principally on servicedevice offerings price network quality coverage area and customer service 

broadband the desire for highspeed data on demand including video is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or linear services and use our fiber services or competitors’ wireless satellite and internetbased services in most us markets we compete for customers with large cable companies for highspeed internet and voice services wireless broadband providers and other smaller telecommunications companies for both longdistance and local services 

legacy voice and data we continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to competitors eg wireless cable and voip providers who can provide comparable services at lower prices because they are not subject to traditional telephone industry regulation or the extent of regulation they are subject to is in dispute utilize different technologies or promote a different business model such as advertisingbased in response to these competitive pressures for a number of years we have used a bundling strategy that rewards customers who consolidate their services with us we continue to focus on bundling services and will continue to develop innovative and integrated services that capitalize on our wireless and ipbased network 



additionally we provide local and interstate telephone and switched services to other service providers primarily large internet service providers using the largest class of nationwide internet networks internet backbone wireless carriers other telephone companies cable companies and systems integrators these services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies the introduction of innovative offerings and increasing satellite wireless fiberoptic and cable transmission capacity for services we face a number of international competitors including orange business services bt singapore telecommunications limited and verizon communications inc as well as competition from a number of large systems integrators 

media our warnermedia businesses face shifts in consumer viewing patterns increased competition from streaming services and the expansion by other companies in particular technology companies in may 2020 we launched hbo max our platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers as well as through our traditional distributors 

warnermedia competes with other studios and television production groups and independents to produce and sell programming many television networks and online platforms have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their programming which has reduced their demand for programming from nonaffiliated production companies warnermedia also faces competition from other television networks online platforms and premium pay television services for distribution and marketing of its television networks and premium pay and basic tier television services by affiliates 

our warnermedia businesses compete with other production companies and studios for the services of producers directors writers actors and others and for the acquisition of literary properties in recent years technology companies also have begun to produce programming and compete with warnermedia for talent and property rights 

advertising the increased amount of consumer time spent online and on mobile activities has resulted in the shift of advertising budgets away from traditional television to digital advertising warnermedia’s advertisingsupported television networks and digital properties compete with streaming services other networks and digital properties print radio and other media our programmatic advertising business faces competition from a variety of technology companies similar to all participants in the advertising technology sector we contend with the dominance of google as well as the influence of facebook whose practices may result in the decreased ability and willingness of advertisers and programmers to adopt programmatic solutions offered by alternative suppliers in december 2021 we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of xandr see note 6

compensation and benefits in addition to salaries we provide a variety of benefit programs to help meet the needs of our employees these programs cover active and former employees and may vary by subsidiary and region these programs include 401k plans pension benefits and health and welfare benefits among many others in addition to our active employee base at december 31 2021 we had approximately 512000 retirees and dependents who were eligible to receive retiree benefits 

we review our benefit plans to maintain competitive packages that reflect the needs of our workforce we also adapt our compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices across our business we are committed to pay equity for employees who hold the same jobs work in the same geographic area and have the same levels of experience and performance 

employee safety we provide our employees access to flexible and convenient health and welfare programs and workplace accommodations in response to the covid19 pandemic we consulted with medical professionals to institute policies that best protected our employees and their families including a policy that requires the vast majority of our employees to be vaccinated we have prioritized selfcare and emphasized a focus on wellness providing personal protective equipment flexible scheduling or timeoff options and implementing technologies to enhance the necessary remotework environment as we look to life and operations beyond the pandemic we are revising our business models to support flexible office space and athome productivity for many employees on a permanent basis

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this document including the matters contained under the caption “cautionary language concerning forwardlooking statements” you should carefully read the matters described below we believe that each of these matters could materially affect our business we recognize that most of these factors are beyond our ability to control and therefore we cannot predict an outcome 



macroeconomic factors 

adverse changes in the us securities markets interest rates and medical costs could materially increase our benefit plan costs and future funding requirements 

our costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases primarily due to continuing increases in medical and prescription drug costs and can be affected by lower returns on assets held by our pension and other benefit plans which are reflected in our financial statements for that year in calculating the recognized benefit costs we have made certain assumptions regarding future investment returns interest rates and medical costs these assumptions could change significantly over time and could be materially different than originally projected lower than assumed investment returns a decline in interest rates with a corresponding increase in our benefit obligations and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug costs will increase expenses 

the financial accounting standards board requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur we have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income therefore an increase in our costs or adverse market conditions will have a negative effect on our operating results 

significant adverse changes in capital markets could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plans’ funded status and result in increased contribution requirements for such plans which could be material 

inflationary pressures on costs such as inputs for devices we sell and network components labor and distribution costs may impact our network construction our financial condition or results of operations 

as a provider of telecommunications and technology services we sell handsets wireless data cards wireless computing devices and customer premises equipment manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services and depend on suppliers to provide us directly or through other suppliers with items such as network equipment customer premises equipment and wirelessrelated equipment such as mobile hotspots handsets wirelessly enabled computers wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers in 2021 and the early part of 2022 the costs of these inputs and the costs of labor necessary to develop and maintain our networks and our products and services have rapidly increased in addition many of these inputs are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors including but not limited to market conditions demand for raw materials used in the production of these devices and network components weather climate change energy costs currency fluctuations supplier capacities governmental actions import and export requirements including tariffs and other factors beyond our control although we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2022 we also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022 

our attempts to offset these cost pressures such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products and services may not be successful higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our products and may increasingly purchase lowerpriced offerings or may forego some purchases altogether during an economic downturn to the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected furthermore we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity and costsaving initiatives 

adverse changes in global financial markets could limit our ability and our larger customers’ ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operations 

during 2021 uncertainty surrounding global growth rates and the impact of the covid19 pandemic continued to produce volatility in the credit currency and equity markets volatility may affect companies’ access to the credit markets leading to higher borrowing costs or in some cases the inability to fund ongoing operations in addition we contract with large financial institutions to support our own treasury operations including contracts to hedge our exposure on interest rates and foreign exchange and the funding of credit lines and other shortterm debt obligations including commercial paper these financial institutions face stricter capitalrelated and other regulations in the united states and europe as well as ongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loan portfolios which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit 



the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to phase out libor in 2023 although our securities may provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may adversely affect the current trading market for liborbased securities and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general a company’s cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects while we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions severely affecting our business operations additionally downgrades of our credit rating by the major credit rating agencies could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreements we have entered into with our derivative counterparties which could negatively impact our liquidity further valuation changes in our derivative portfolio due to interest rates and foreign exchange rates could require us to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity 

our international operations have increased our exposure to political instability to changes in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risks could offset our expected growth opportunities 

we have international operations including in mexico and worldwide through warnermedia’s content distribution we need to comply with a wide variety of complex local laws regulations and treaties we are exposed to restrictions on cash repatriation foreign exchange controls fluctuations in currency values changes in relationships between us and foreign governments trade restrictions including potential tariffs differences in intellectual property protection laws and other regulations that may affect materially our earnings our mexico operations in particular rely on a continuation of a regulatory regime that fosters competition while our foreign operations represent significant opportunities to sell our services a number of foreign countries where we operate have experienced unstable growth patterns increased inflation currency devaluation foreign exchange controls instability in the banking sector and high unemployment should these conditions persist our ability to offer service in one or more countries could be adversely affected and customers in these countries may be unable to purchase the services we offer or pay for services already provided 

in addition operating in foreign countries also typically involves participating with local businesses either to comply with local laws or for example to enhance product marketing deploy networks or execute on other capital projects involvement with foreign firms exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the actions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa violations of the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

industrywide factors 

our business is subject to risks arising from the outbreak of the covid19 virus 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting mitigation measures have caused and may continue to cause a negative effect on our operating results at the onset in 2020 mitigation measures caused sports leagues to modify their seasons and suspend certain operations which adversely affected our advertising revenues and resulted in contract disputes concerning carriage rights that caused us to incur expenses relating to certain of these sporting events notwithstanding their cancellation the closure or avoidance of theaters and the interruptions in movie production and other programming caused by covid19 are expected to continue to impact the timing of revenues and may cause a loss of revenue to our warnermedia business over the long term the covid19 pandemic also drove higher costs for our warnermedia business in 2021 based on the hybrid distribution model for releasing films in 2021 and costs associated with safety measures put in place to help provide a safe environment for content production if the mitigation measures or the associated effects are prolonged we expect business customers in industries most significantly impacted will continue to reduce or terminate services having a negative effect on the performance of our business wireline business unit further concerns over the covid19 pandemic could again result in the closure of many of our retail stores temporarily or permanently and deter customers from accessing our stores even as the pandemic subsides these pandemic concerns may also result in continued impact to our customers’ ability to pay for our products and services we may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenues due to a downturn in international travel the covid19 pandemic has caused and could further cause reduced staffing levels at our call centers and field operations resulting in delays in service further reductions in staffing levels could additionally limit our ability to provide services adversely impacting our competitive position we may also incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments required to meet higher network utilization from more customers consuming bandwidth from changes in work from home trends extended cancellation periods and increased labor costs if the covid19 pandemic continues for an extended period 



the covid19 pandemic and mitigation measures have caused and may continue to cause adverse impacts on global economic conditions and consumer confidence spending and consumer behavior which could affect demand for our products and services the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning other strains of the virus and the actions to contain its impact due to the speed with which the situation continues to develop and change we are not able at this time to estimate the additional impact of covid19 on our financial or operational results but the impact could be material 

changes to federal state and foreign government regulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings as well as private litigation could further increase our operating costs andor alter customer perceptions of our operations which could materially adversely affect us 

our subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitors are not in addition our subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside the united states are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided our wireless and various video subsidiaries are regulated to varying degrees by the fcc and in some instances by state and local agencies adverse regulations and rulings by the fcc relating to broadband and wireless deployment could impede our ability to manage our networks and recover costs and lessen incentives to invest in our networks the continuing growth of ipbased services especially when accessed by wireless devices has created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcomes unfavorable to us in addition in response to the faa questioning whether our 5g cband launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes we voluntarily committed to a series of temporary precautionary measures in addition to deferring turning on a limited number of towers around certain airports to allow the faa more time to evaluate the faa’s continued evaluation may impact our planned 5g cband launch in certain areas in addition increased public focus on a variety of issues related to our operations such as privacy issues government requests or orders for customer data and concerns about global climate changes have led to proposals or new legislation at state federal and foreign government levels to change or increase regulation on our operations enactment of new privacy laws and regulations could among other things adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisements or result in additional costs of compliance or litigation should customers decide that our competitors offer a more customerfriendly environment our competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

effects of climate change may impose risk of damage to our infrastructure our ability to provide services and may cause changes in federal state and foreign government regulation all of which may result in potential adverse impact to our financial results 

extreme weather events precipitated by longterm climate change have the potential to directly damage network facilities or disrupt our ability to build and maintain portions of our network and could potentially disrupt suppliers’ ability to provide products and services required to provide reliable network coverage any such disruption could delay network deployment plans interrupt service for our customers increase our costs and have a negative effect on our operating results the potential physical effects of climate change such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods fires freezing conditions sealevel rise and other climaterelated events could adversely affect our operations infrastructure and financial results operational impacts resulting from the potential physical effects of climate change such as damage to our network infrastructure could result in increased costs and loss of revenue we could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for respond to and mitigate such physical effects of climate change we are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change 

further customers consumers investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues including climate change water use deforestation plastic waste and other sustainability concerns concern over climate change or other environmental social and governance esg matters may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment and reduce the impact of our business on climate change further climate change regulations may require us to alter our proposed business plans or increase our operating costs due to increased regulation or environmental considerations and could adversely affect our business and reputation 



continuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless and broadband services will require us to deploy significant amounts of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive services to customers 

wireless and broadband services are undergoing rapid and significant technological changes and a dramatic increase in usage in particular the demand for faster and seamless usage of data including video across mobile and fixed devices the covid19 pandemic has accelerated these changes and also resulted in higher network utilization as more customers consume bandwidth from changes in work from home trends we must continually invest in our networks in order to improve our wireless and broadband services to meet this increasing demand and changes in customer expectations while remaining competitive improvements in these services depend on many factors including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these services in order to stem broadband subscriber losses to cable competitors in our nonfiber wireline areas we have been expanding our allfiber wireline network we must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of data including video and voice between cell and fixed landline sites to this end we participate in spectrum auctions and continue to deploy software and other technology advancements in order to efficiently invest in our network 

network service enhancements and product launches may not occur as scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors including delays in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standards supplier delays software issues increases in network and handset component costs regulatory permitting delays for tower sites or enhancements or laborrelated delays deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing services if we cannot acquire needed spectrum or deploy the services customers desire on a timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonable costs then our ability to attract and retain customers and therefore maintain and improve our operating margins could be materially adversely affected 

increasing competition for wireless customers could materially adversely affect our operating results 

we have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas and compete for customers based principally on servicedevice offerings price network quality coverage area and customer service in addition we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using advanced wireless technologies and ipbased networks we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates leading to increased competition for customers our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing strategies pursued by competitors we also expect that our customers’ growing demand for highspeed video and data services will place constraints on our network capacity these competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers our ability to respond will depend among other things on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our products and services competitively as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services these efforts will involve significant expenses and require strategic management decisions on and timely implementation of equipment choices network deployment and service offerings 

intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by piracy or be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunities such as new distribution platforms which may materially adversely affect our operations 

increased piracy of video content products and other intellectual property particularly in our foreign warnermedia operations will decrease revenues technological developments have made it easier to reproduce and distribute highquality unauthorized copies of content piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and other legal protections or enforcement measures and thieves can attract users throughout the world effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate we may need to spend significant amounts of money to protect our rights we are also increasingly negotiating broader licensing agreements to expand our ability to use new methods to distribute content to customers any impairment of our intellectual property rights including due to changes in us or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures or our inability to negotiate broader distribution rights could materially adversely impact our operations 



incidents leading to damage to our reputation and any resulting lawsuits claims or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we believe that our brand image awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business we strive to create a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and respect and feel comfortable speaking up to report instances of misconduct or other concerns our ability to attract and retain employees is highly dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace ethical business practices and other qualities acts of misconduct by any employee and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us and from any number of activities or circumstances including operations employmentrelated offenses such as sexual harassment and discrimination regulatory compliance and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct we have in the past been and may in the future be named as a defendant in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business based on alleged acts of misconduct by employees these actions seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury including claims for loss of life workers’ compensation employment discrimination sexual harassment workplace misconduct wage and hour claims and other employmentrelated damages compensation for breach of contract statutory or regulatory claims negligence or gross negligence punitive damages consequential damages and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief the outcome of any allegations lawsuits claims or legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of management’s attention from our business additionally our news organization makes editorial judgments around what is covered and how it is covered in the normal course of business although we have disciplined practices that are used to make such editorial judgments it is possible that our news coverage alienates some consumers adversely impacts our reputation and therefore impacts demand for our other products and services any damage to our reputation or payments of significant amounts even if reserved could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

companyspecific financial factors 

adoption of new softwarebased technologies may involve quality and supply chain issues and could increase capital costs 

the communications and digital entertainment industry has experienced rapid changes in the past several years an increasing number of our customers are using mobile devices as the primary means of viewing video and an increasing number of nontraditional video providers are developing content and technologies to satisfy the desire for video entertainment demand in addition businesses and government bodies are broadly shifting to wirelessbased services for homes and infrastructure to improve services to their respective customers and constituencies we have spent and continue to spend significant capital to shift our wired network to softwarebased technology to manage this demand and are expanding 5g wireless technology to address these consumer demands we are entering into a significant number of software licensing agreements and working with software developers to provide network functions in lieu of installing switches or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid developments in video and wireless demand while softwarebased functionality can be changed much more quickly than for example physical switches the rapid pace of development means that we may increasingly need to rely on singlesource and software solutions that have not previously been deployed in production environments should this software not function as intended or our license agreements provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claims we could be forced to either substitute if available or else spend time to develop alternative technologies at a much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability and as a result our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected 



we depend on various suppliers to provide equipment to operate our business and satisfy customer demand and interruption or delay in supply can adversely impact our operating results 

we depend on suppliers to provide us directly or through other suppliers with items such as network equipment customer premises equipment and wirelessrelated equipment such as mobile hotspots handsets wirelessly enabled computers wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers these suppliers could fail to provide equipment on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations for a number of reasons including difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technologies inability to secure component parts general business disruption natural disasters safety issues economic and political instability and public health emergencies such as the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has caused and may again cause delays in the development manufacturing including the sourcing of key components and shipment of products in certain limited circumstances suppliers have been unable to supply products in a timely fashion in such limited circumstances we have been unable to provide products and services precisely as and when requested by our customers it is possible that in some circumstances we could be forced to switch to a different key supplier because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products of one or more key suppliers with products from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negative effect on our operating results 

increasing costs to provide services and failure to renew agreements on favorable terms or at all could adversely affect operating margins 

our operating costs including customer acquisition and retention costs could continue to put pressure on margins and customer retention levels 

a number of our competitors offering comparable legacy services that rely on alternative technologies and business models are typically subject to less or no regulation and therefore are able to operate with lower costs these competitors generally can focus on discrete customer segments since they do not have regulatory obligations to provide universal service also these competitors have cost advantages compared to us due in part to operating on newer more technically advanced and lowercost networks with a nonunionized workforce lower employee benefits and fewer retirees we are transitioning services from our old copperbased network and seeking regulatory approvals where needed at both the state and federal levels if we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our network transition or obtain approvals with onerous conditions we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantages 

our warnermedia operations which create and license content to other providers may experience increasing difficulties securing favorable terms including those related to pricing positioning and packaging during contract negotiations which may lead to blackouts of warnermedia programming and warnermedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks and premium pay television services in offerings by third parties 

we may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives which are designed to reduce costs streamline and modernize distribution and customer service remove redundancies and simplify and improve processes and support functions our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience we intend for these efficiencies to enable increased investments in our strategic areas of focus which consist of improving broadband connectivity for example fiber and 5g developing softwarebased entertainment such as hbo max and utilizing warnermedia’s storytelling legacy to engage consumers and gain insights across multiple distribution points we also expect these initiatives to drive efficiencies and improved margins if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits improvements may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operations and competitive position could be adversely affected 



if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers to our hbo max platform and to develop compelling choices are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

hbo max’s future success is subject to inherent uncertainty our ability to continue to attract subscribers to the hbo max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscribers with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choices furthermore the relative service levels content offerings promotions and pricing and related features of competitors to hbo max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers if consumers do not perceive our offerings to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or offerings terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings experience technical issues or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers in addition many subscribers to these types of offerings originate from wordofmouth advertising from then existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy subscribers are not successful including because we terminate or modify promotional or trialperiod offerings or because of technical issues with the platform we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected 

if subscribers cancel or decide to not continue subscriptions for any reason including a perception that they do not use it sufficiently the need to cut household expenses unsatisfactory availability of content promotions or trialperiod offers expire or are modified competitive services or promotions provide a better value or experience and customer service or technical issues are not satisfactorily resolved our business will be adversely affected we must continually add new subscribers both to replace canceled subscribers and to grow our business if we do not grow as expected given in particular that a significant portion of our content costs are committed and contracted over several years based on minimum subscriber delivery levels we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per subscriber revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in retaining and attracting new subscribers our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers do cancel we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures or offer significantly more generous promotions to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries including at any particular time claims relating to antitrust patent infringement wage and hour personal injury customer privacy violations regulatory proceedings and selling and collection practices we also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards which may entail related investigations and litigation in the wireless area we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effects on customers or employees who use such technologies including for example wireless devices we may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our operations or financial results 

cyberattacks equipment failures natural disasters and terrorist acts may materially adversely affect our operations 

cyberattacks major equipment failures or natural disasters such as flooding hurricanes and forest fires whether caused by discrete severe weather events andor precipitated by longterm climate change and earthquakes software problems data and privacy breaches terrorist acts or other breaches of network or it security that affect our networks including software and switches microwave links thirdpartyowned local and longdistance networks on which we rely our cell sites or other equipment our satellites our customer account support and information systems or employee and business records could have a material adverse effect on our operations our wired network in particular is becoming increasingly reliant on software as it evolves to handle increasing demands for video transmission while we have been subject to security incidents or cyberattacks these did not result in a material adverse effect on our operations however as such attacks continue to increase in scope and frequency we may be unable to prevent a significant attack in the future our inability to deploy or operate our networks or customer support systems or protect sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information could result in significant expenses potential legal liability a loss of current or future customers and reputation damage any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 



increases in our debt levels to fund spectrum purchases or other strategic decisions could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rates and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trends 

we have incurred debt to fund significant acquisitions as well as spectrum purchases needed to compete in our industry while we believe such decisions were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunities and respond to industry developments we did experience creditrating downgrades from historical levels banks and potential purchasers of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decisions and similar actions we may take in the future as well as expected trends in the industry will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand a higher rate of interest impose restrictive covenants or otherwise limit the amount of potential borrowing additionally our capital allocation plan is focused on among other things managing our debt level going forward any failure to successfully execute this plan could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

our business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations judicial interpretations of same or administrative actions by federal state local and foreign taxing authorities 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied in many cases the application of existing newly enacted or amended tax laws such as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations especially when evaluated against ever changing products and services provided by our global telecommunications media and technology businesses in addition tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate tax liabilities and carrying value of deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could materially impact our financial performance and our tax provision net income and cash flows 

we are also subject to ongoing examinations by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions although we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of provisions for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations in the event that we have not accurately or fully described disclosed or determined calculated or remitted amounts that were due to taxing authorities or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued we could be subject to additional taxes penalties and interest which could materially impact our business financial condition and operating results 

the proposed separation and combination of our warnermedia business with discovery may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all 

on may 17 2021 we announced a definitive agreement with discovery inc discovery to combine our warnermedia business with discovery the “warnermediadiscovery transaction” which if consummated would result in our stockholders owning 71 of the combined company’s discovery’s outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis computed using the treasury stock method the warnermediadiscovery transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022 subject to certain customary closing conditions including among others the approval of discovery’s stockholders the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the finalization of a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to the effect that the separation of the warnermedia business and certain related transactions will qualify for taxfree treatment under the internal revenue code the “private letter ruling” 

there can be no assurance that such closing conditions will be satisfied or waived or that the warnermediadiscovery transaction will be consummated required regulatory approvals may not be received in a timely manner or at all further while we have entered into voting agreements with certain stockholders of discovery representing in the aggregate approximately 43 of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of discovery capital stock as of may 14 2021 pursuant to which they have agreed to vote in favor of certain aspects of the warnermediadiscovery transaction we cannot assure you that the approval of discovery’s stockholders will be obtained we and discovery may be subject to shareholder lawsuits or other actions filed in connection with or in opposition to the warnermediadiscovery transaction which could prevent or delay the consummation of the warnermediadiscovery transaction 

if the distribution of warnermedia together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for nonrecognition treatment for us federal income tax purposes then we could be subject to significant tax liability 

under the merger agreement receipt of the private letter ruling from the irs is a condition to close the warnermediadiscovery transaction on december 28 2021 att received a favorable private letter ruling from the irs as long as the private letter ruling continues to be in full force and effect until closing att expects that the receipt of the private letter ruling satisfies the closing condition for an irs ruling while not anticipated situations where a private letter ruling could cease to be in full force and effect may include situations where there is a material change in applicable tax law or a material change to the terms or structure of the transaction reliance on the ruling is also subject to certain facts representations and undertakings made in connection with the request for the ruling 



accordingly the irs or another applicable tax authority could determine on audit that the distribution by us of warnermedia to our stockholders and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts representations or undertakings are incorrect or have been violated we may be entitled to indemnification from discovery in the case of certain breaches of representations or undertakings by discovery under the tax matters agreement related to the warnermediadiscovery transaction however we could potentially be required to pay such tax prior to reimbursement from discovery and such indemnification is subject to discovery’s credit risk if the irs or another tax authority were to so conclude there could be a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition in the event that we are unable to effectuate a spinco debt exchange we could incur significant incremental tax liability associated with the warnermediadiscovery transaction if certain conditions are met discovery generally will be responsible for 50 of such incremental tax liability that does not exceed 4000 for more information regarding the spinco debt exchange refer to the risk factor titled “even if the warnermediadiscovery transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction” below 

the announcement and pendency of the warnermediadiscovery transaction could cause disruptions in our business 

the warnermediadiscovery transaction will require significant amounts of time and effort which could divert management’s attention from operating growing our business and other strategic endeavors further our employees may be distracted due to uncertainty regarding their future roles with us or the warnermedia business pending the consummation of the warnermediadiscovery transaction in the event that the warnermediadiscovery transaction does not close we will be required to bear a number of nonrecurring costs in connection with the transaction including financial legal accounting consulting and other advisory fees and expenses reorganization and restructuring costs severanceemployee benefitrelated expenses regulatory and sec filing fees and expenses printing expenses and other related charges until the consummation or termination of the warnermediadiscovery transaction we are also required to operate the warnermedia business in the ordinary course and we are restricted from taking certain specified actions with respect to our warnermedia business without discovery’s consent any of the foregoing could adversely affect our operating results 

even if the warnermediadiscovery transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the transaction 

even if the warnermediadiscovery transaction is completed the anticipated operational financial strategic and other benefits of such transaction to the company and our stockholders may not be achieved there are many factors that could impact the anticipated benefits from the warnermediadiscovery transaction including among others strategic adjustments required to reflect the nature of our business following the warnermediadiscovery transaction and any negative reaction to the warnermediadiscovery transaction by our customers and business partners in addition we have agreed to provide certain transition services to the combined company which may result in additional expenses and may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our businesses 

in connection with the warnermediadiscovery transaction we will receive approximately 43000 subject to certain adjustments in the form of a combination of i the assumption by the warnermedia business of certain existing debt ii a cash dividend distributed to us from the warnermedia business the “spinco special cash payment” and iii debt instruments of the warnermedia business the “spinco debt distribution” we expect to deliver such debt instruments of warnermedia in exchange for certain of our outstanding debt obligations the “spinco debt exchange” and to use the proceeds of the spinco special cash payment to repay certain of our other outstanding debt obligations this process will be complex and may require significant time and resources depending on various variables such as interest rates and timing at the time of the spinco debt exchange att’s transaction costs relating to the spinco debt exchange may be significantly higher than expected additionally if market conditions change in advance of the spinco debt exchange such that it is no longer feasible for the warnermedia business to issue debt securities with a fair market value at least equal to their face value we may be required to take an additional distribution of cash from the warnermedia business in lieu of effecting the spinco debt exchange which could result in potentially significant incremental tax liability if certain conditions are met discovery generally will be responsible for 50 of such incremental tax liability that does not exceed 4000 

an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the warnermediadiscovery transaction as well as any delays encountered in the process could have an adverse effect on our revenues level of expenses and operating results 

in connection with the separation of the warnermedia business and the completed transaction involving our video business unit certain liabilities will be or were allocated to or retained by us and we will be subject to indemnification obligations in respect of those liabilities 



in connection with the separation of the warnermedia business and the completed transaction involving our video business unit the “dtv transaction” we have agreed to assume or retain and indemnify the warnermedia business and the video business unit for certain liabilities payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the distribution of the warnermedia business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any liabilities allocated to the warnermedia business and the video business unit and such third parties could seek damages other monetary penalties whether civil or criminal and other remedies 

the separation of the warnermedia business and the video business unit may result in an increase in our costs and expenses 

following the consummation of the warnermediadiscovery transaction and the dtv transaction we will no longer benefit from economies of scale and synergies we currently have or expected to realize between our warnermedia business our video business unit and our remaining businesses including through intercompany arrangements and combined agreements with third parties there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue any of these arrangements or that any such continuing arrangements will be on the same or more favorable terms following the separation of the warnermedia business and the video business unit additionally there can be no assurance that costs retained by att after the warnermediadiscovery transaction and the dtv transaction will be fully recovered through transition service agreements or business transformation initiatives as a result our costs and expenses may increase following the consummation of the warnermediadiscovery transaction and the dtv transaction

we have three reportable segments 1 communications 2 warnermedia and 3 latin america our segment results presented in note 4 and discussed below follow our internal management reporting we analyze our segments based on segment operating contribution which consists of operating income excluding acquisitionrelated costs and other significant items and equity in net income loss of affiliates for investments managed within each segment each segment’s percentage calculation of total segment operating revenue and contribution is derived from our segment results table in note 4 and may total more than 100 due to losses in one or more segments percentage increases and decreases that are not considered meaningful are denoted with a dash 





the communications segment accounted for approximately 74 of our 2021 total segment operating revenues compared to 75 in 2020 and 81 of our 2021 total segment operating contribution as compared to 79 in 2020 this segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the us and businesses globally our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets this segment contains the following business units

results of operations 

consolidated results our financial results are summarized in the following table we then discuss factors affecting our overall results additional analysis is discussed in our “segment results” section we also discuss our expected revenue and expense trends for 2022 in the “operating environment and trends of the business” section certain priorperiod amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation 





overview 

operating revenues decreased in 2021 with declines reflecting our july 31 2021 separation of the us video business the completion of the sale of our vrio business unit in november 2021 and the october 2020 sale of wireless and wireline operations in puerto rico and the us virgin islands also contributing to revenue declines was lower business wireline revenues due in part to higher demand for pandemicrelated connectivity in the prior year partially offsetting declines were higher mobility equipment and service revenues and gains in broadband service in our communications segment higher content and dtc subscription revenues in our warnermedia segment and growth in mexico wireless operations including favorable foreign exchange impacts 

operations and support expenses decreased in 2021 with declines reflecting our business divestitures lower bad debt expense and lower personnel costs associated with our ongoing transformation initiatives declines were mostly offset by increased domestic wireless equipment expense from higher volumes and higher warnermedia programming costs and marketing activities 

asset impairments and abandonments decreased in 2021 with higher impairments in 2020 noncash impairment charges in 2020 included 15508 resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the longlived assets and goodwill associated with our us video business see notes 7 and 9 2212 goodwill impairment at our vrio business unit see note 9 and 780 from the impairment of production and other content inventory at warnermedia with approximately 524 resulting from the continued shutdown of theaters during the pandemic and the hybrid distribution model for our 2021 film slate see note 11 in 2021 we took an additional vrio impairment of 4555 resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the net assets of vrio see note 6 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2021 

amortization expense decreased 3779 or 472 in 2021 primarily due to ceasing amortization on video and vrio heldforsale assets 

depreciation expense decreased 1875 or 91 in 2021 primarily due to the lower cost basis of property plant and equipment resulting from video impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2020 and ceasing depreciation on video and vrio heldforsale assets in 2021 

operating income increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 our operating margin was 138 in 2021 compared to 37 in 2020 and 154 in 2019 

interest expense decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower interest rates and capitalized interest associated with the spectrum acquisitions partially offset by higher debt balances 

equity in net income loss of affiliates increased in 2021 primarily due to the close of our transaction with tpg related to the us video business which resulted in our accounting for our investment in directv under the equity method of accounting beginning august 1 2021 see notes 6 and 20 

other income expense – net increased in 2021 primarily due to the recognition of 4140 in actuarial gains compared to losses of 4169 in 2020 and recognition of 1405 of debt redemption costs in 2020 also contributing to increased income were higher net pension and postretirement benefit credits from higher prior service credit amortization see note 15 and net gains on the sale of assets see note 6 

income tax expense increased in 2021 primarily driven by increased income before income taxes offset primarily by the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act benefit of us federal net operating loss nol carryback and benefits on divestitures in 2021 

our effective tax rate was 203 in 2021 338 in 2020 and 189 in 2019 the effective tax rate in 2020 was impacted by our impairment of vrio and video goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes 



segment results our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms andor in different geographies that are managed accordingly our segment results presented below follow our internal management reporting in addition to segment operating contribution we also evaluate segment performance based on ebitda andor ebitda margin ebitda is defined as segment operating contribution excluding equity in net income loss of affiliates and depreciation and amortization we believe ebitda to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate operating performance ebitda does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating contribution nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions reinvestment or other discretionary uses ebitda margin is ebitda divided by total revenues 



operating revenues increased in 2021 driven by increases in our mobility and consumer wireline business units partially offset by a decrease in our business wireline business unit the increases are primarily driven by equipment and wireless service revenue growth and gains in broadband service 

operating contribution decreased in 2021 and 2020 the 2021 operating contribution includes declines in our business wireline and consumer wireline business units and reflects an increase in operating contribution from our mobility business unit our communications segment operating income margin was 246 in 2021 257 in 2020 and 271 in 2019 



communications business unit discussion 



the following tables highlight other key measures of performance for mobility 







service revenue increased during 2021 largely due to growth from subscriber gains 

arpu 

average revenue per subscriber arpu decreased in 2021 and reflects the impact of higher promotional discount amortization see note 5 

churn 

the effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins postpaid churn and postpaid phoneonly churn were lower in 2021 due to retention offers migrations to unlimited plans continued network performance and lower involuntary disconnects 

equipment revenue increased in 2021 primarily driven by increased volumes the sale of higherpriced smartphones and a mix of higherpriced postpaid smartphones 

operations and support expenses increased in 2021 largely driven by growth in equipment sales and associated expenses including costs associated with the upcoming firstquarter 2022 3g network shutdown increased content costs associated with bundling hbo max increased amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs and higher network and technology costs these expense increases were partially offset by lower sales costs and lower bad debt expense 

depreciation expense increased in 2021 primarily due to ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion partially offset by fully depreciated assets 

operating income increased in 2021 and 2020 our mobility operating income margin was 298 in 2021 308 in 2020 and 314 in 2019 our mobility ebitda margin was 402 in 2021 420 in 2020 and 427 in 2019 



subscriber relationships 

as the wireless industry has matured with nearly full penetration of smartphones in the us population future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services plans and devices that bundle product offerings and take advantage of our 5g wireless network which went nationwide in july 2020 we believe 5g opens up vast possibilities of connecting sensors devices and autonomous things commonly referred to as the internet of things iot more and more these devices are performing use cases that require high bandwidth ultrareliability and low latency that only 5g and edge computing can bring to support higher mobile data usage our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible in january 2022 we began to deploy our cband spectrum acquired in fcc auction 107 see note 6 

to attract and retain subscribers in a mature and highly competitive market we have launched a wide variety of plans including our firstnet and prepaid products and arrangements that bundle our services virtually all of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are on plans that provide for service on multiple devices at reduced rates and subscribers to such plans tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates we offer unlimited data plans and subscribers to such plans also tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates our offerings are intended to encourage existing subscribers to upgrade their current services andor add devices attract subscribers from other providers andor minimize subscriber churn subscribers that purchase two or more services from us have significantly lower churn than subscribers that purchase only one service 



service revenues decreased in 2021 driven by lower demand for legacy voice and data services in the current year proactive rationalization of low profit margin products and higher demand for pandemicrelated connectivity in the prioryear we expect this trend to continue 

equipment revenues decreased in 2021 driven by declines in legacy and noncore services which we expect to continue 

operations and support expenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to our continued efforts to drive efficiencies in our network operations through automation and reductions in customer support expenses through digitization and proactive rationalization of low profit margin products 

depreciation expense decreased in 2021 primarily due to certain network assets becoming fully depreciated 

operating income decreased in 2021 and 2020 our business wireline operating income margin was 167 in 2021 182 in 2020 and 198 in 2019 our business wireline ebitda margin was 384 in 2021 390 in 2020 and 388 in 2019 





the following tables highlight other key measures of performance for consumer wireline 





broadband revenues increased in 2021 driven by an increase in fiber customers and pricing which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 

legacy voice and data service revenues decreased in 2021 reflecting the continued decline in the number of customers which we expect to continue 

other service and equipment revenues decreased in 2021 reflecting the continued decline in the number of voip customers which we expect to continue 



operations and support expenses increased in 2021 primarily driven by higher advertising technology and customer support costs and content costs associated with plans bundling hbo max partially offsetting these increases was lower amortization of deferred fulfillment costs including updates to extend the estimated economic life of our subscribers 

depreciation expense increased in 2021 primarily due to ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion 

operating income decreased in 2021 and 2020 our consumer wireline operating income margin was 78 in 2021 112 in 2020 and 181 in 2019 our consumer wireline ebitda margin was 325 in 2021 348 in 2020 and 402 in 2019 



our warnermedia segment is operated as a content organization that distributes across various platforms including basic networks directtoconsumer dtc or theatrical tv content and games licensing 

hbo latin america group hbo lag is included as an equity method investment prior to our acquiring the remaining interest in may 2020 it is included in the segment operating results following the date of acquisition 

on may 17 2021 we entered into an agreement to combine our warnermedia segment subject to certain exceptions with a subsidiary of discovery inc on december 21 2021 we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of xandr to microsoft corporation microsoft see note 6 

operating revenues increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily due to increases in content and other reflecting the partial recovery from prioryear impacts of the pandemic and also in subscription revenues the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower content and advertising revenues which were negatively impacted by the pandemic partially offset by higher subscription revenues 

subscription revenues increased in 2021 and 2020 reflecting growth of dtc domestic hbo max and hbo subscribers and the may 2020 acquisition of the remaining interest in hbo latin america group dtc subscription revenues were 7723 in 2021 versus 6090 and 5814 in 2020 and 2019 respectively and include growth from intercompany relationships with the communications segment 



content and other revenues increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 the increase in 2021 was due to higher tv production and licensing which represent a partial recovery from prioryear impacts of the pandemic as well as higher theatrical with 2020 including only five worldwide theatrical releases compared to 17 in 2021 the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to pandemicrelated movie theater closures and television and theatrical production delays 

advertising revenues increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 the increase in 2021 was due to the return in 2021 of major sporting events including the ncaa division i men’s championship basketball tournament the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to the pandemicrelated cancellation of sporting events partially offset by higher news coverage of general elections and covid19 developments 

direct costs increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 the increase in 2021 was driven by higher film and programming costs and increased costs for hbo max direct costs supporting dtc revenues were 7934 in 2021 versus 5452 and 3824 in 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to pandemicrelated closures and production delays 

selling general and administrative expenses increased in 2021 and decreased in 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily due to incremental selling costs associated with a directv advertising revenue sharing arrangement partially offset by lower bad debt expense and integration of support functions the decrease in 2020 was primarily due to lower print and advertising expenses from limited theatrical releases lower distribution fees and costsaving initiatives partially offset by marketing costs associated with hbo max 

operating contribution decreased in 2021 and 2020 the warnermedia segment operating income margin was 203 in 2021 269 in 2020 and 298 in 2019 



our latin america operations conduct business in their local currency and operating results are converted to us dollars using official exchange rates subjecting results to foreign currency fluctuations 

on november 15 2021 we completed the sale of our latin america video operations vrio to grupo werthein see note 6 

operating revenues decreased in 2021 reflecting the sale of vrio partially offset by growth in the mexico wireless operations foreign exchange pressure in vrio was partially offset by improvements in mexico 

operating contribution improved in 2021 reflecting higher profitability in mexico and lower depreciation resulting from vrio assets being accounted for as heldforsale our latin america segment operating income margin was 81 in 2021 132 in 2020 and 95 in 2019

operating environment and trends of the business 

2022 revenue trends we expect revenue growth in our wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by wireless network enhancements through 5g deployment and our fiber network expansion we also expect revenue growth from continued investment in premium content and by expanding the international reach of hbo max 

in our communications segment we expect that our simplified gotomarket strategy for 5g in underpenetrated markets will continue to contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that expansion of our fiber footprint and our new multigig rollout will drive greater demand for broadband services on our fastgrowing fiber network 

in our warnermedia segment we expect our video streaming platform hbo max and premium content will continue to drive revenue growth the pandemicrelated partial closure of movie theaters is expected to continue to pressure revenues however we are working towards a shorter but exclusive theatrical window for our 2022 film slate the decline in viewing on our basic cable networks is expected to continue as consumers continue to increase their use of streaming platforms 

as we expand our fiber reach we will be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity to offset continuing declines in legacy business wireline products by growing connectivity with small to midsized business we plan to use our strong fiber and wireless assets broad distribution and converged product offers to strengthen our overall market position we will continue to deemphasize noncore services with a longerterm shift of the business to fiber and mobile connectivity and growth in valueadded services 

2022 expense trends we expect the spending required to support growth initiatives primarily our continued deployment of fiber and 5g including 3g shutdown costs in the first quarter of 2022 as well as continued investment into the hbo max platform to pressure expense trends in 2022 to the extent 5g handset introductions continue in 2022 and as anticipated the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs during 2022 we will also continue to prioritize efficiency led by our cost transformation initiative and continued transition from our hardwarebased network technology to more efficient and less expensive softwarebased technology these investments will help prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services including video streaming augmented reality and “smart” technologies the software benefits of our 5g wireless technology should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower networkrelated expenses in the coming years 



we continue to transform our operations to be more efficient and effective reinvesting savings into growth areas of the business we are restructuring businesses sunsetting legacy networks improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels and reassessing overall benefit costs cost savings and asset sales align with our focus on debt reduction 

market conditions the us stock market experienced steady growth in 2021 however several factors including the global pandemic have resulted in changes in demand in business communication services the global pandemic has caused and could again cause delays in the development manufacturing including the sourcing of key components and shipment of products as well as continued tight labor market and actual or perceived inflation most of our products and services are not directly affected by the imposition of tariffs on chinese goods however we expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2022 as we respond to the competitive marketplace especially in wireless services 

included on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa we expect only minimal erisa contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2022 investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy and a weakness in the equity fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans in addition our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions however these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in “other income expense – net” changes in our discount rate which are tied to changes in the bond market and changes in the performance of equity markets may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2022 see “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

operating environment overview 

att subsidiaries operating within the united states are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities att subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided 

in the telecommunications act of 1996 telecom act congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare nonetheless over the ensuing two decades the federal communications commission fcc and some state regulatory commissions have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies more recently the fcc has pursued a more deregulatory agenda eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas we continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the state and federal levels to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all ipbased networks at the same time we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services which are subject to vigorous competition 

communications segment 

internet the fcc currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services subject to lighttouch regulation the dc circuit upheld the fcc’s current classification although it remanded three discrete issues to the fcc for further consideration these issues related to the effect of the fcc’s decision to classify broadband services as information services on public safety the regulation of pole attachments and universal service support for lowincome consumers through the lifeline program because no party sought supreme court review of the dc circuit’s decision to uphold the fcc’s classification of broadband as an information service that decision is final 

in october 2020 the fcc adopted an order addressing the three issues remanded by the dc circuit for further consideration after considering those issues the fcc concluded they provided no grounds to depart from its determination that fixed and mobile consumer broadband services should be classified as information services an appeal of the fcc’s remand decision is pending 

some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the fcc suits have been filed concerning such laws in california and vermont the california statute is now in effect and the lawsuit regarding the vermont statute has been stayed pending resolution of any appeal of the california lawsuit we expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements 



on november 15 2021 president biden signed the infrastructure investment and jobs act iija into law the legislation appropriates 65000 to support broadband deployment and adoption the national telecommunications and information agency ntia is responsible for distributing more than 48000 of this funding including 42500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas ntia will establish rules for this program in the first half of 2022 the iija also appropriated 14200 for establishment of the affordable connectivity program acp an fccadministered monthly lowincome broadband benefit program replacing the emergency broadband benefit program established in december 2020 by the consolidated appropriations act 2021 qualifying customers can receive up to thirty dollars per month or seventyfive dollars per month for those on tribal lands to assist with their internet bill att is a participating provider in the acp program and will consider participating in the deployment program where appropriate the iija includes various provisions that will result in fcc proceedings regarding acp program administration and consumer protection reform of the existing universal support program and broadband labeling and equal access 

privacyrelated legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions legislative regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data 

wireless industrywide network densification and 5g technology expansion efforts which are needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access will involve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment this increases the importance of local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment in the public rightofway on reasonable timelines and terms between 2018 and 2020 the fcc adopted multiple orders streamlining federal state and local wireless structure review processes that had the tendency to delay and impede deployment of small cell and related infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services the key elements of these orders have been affirmed on judicial review during 20202021 we have also deployed 5g nationwide on “low band” spectrum on macro towers executing on the recent spectrum purchase we announced ongoing construction and continuing deployment of 5g on cband spectrum in 2022 and beyond 

warnermedia segment 

we create own and distribute intellectual property including copyrights trademarks and licenses of intellectual property to protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of laws and license agreements outside of the us laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country the european union commission is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives which could impact warnermedia’s activities in the eu piracy particularly of digital content continues to threaten warnermedia’s revenues from products and services and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including technological and legislative solutions outside the us various laws and regulations as well as trade agreements with the us also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in movie theaters and on broadcast and cable networks for example in certain countries including china laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year 

expected growth areas 

over the next few years we expect our growth to come from wireless and ipbased fiber broadband services we provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the us on an integrated telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms in 2022 our key initiatives include 

• continuing our wireless subscriber momentum while increasing the pace of our 5g deployment and expansion of 5g service including to underpenetrated markets 

• improving fiber penetration accelerating subscriber growth and increasing broadband revenues 

• increasing international subscriber base for hbo max our platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers as well as through other distributors 

• continuing to develop efficiencies and a competitive advantage through cost transformation initiatives and product simplification 

wireless we expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years we are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for nextgeneration converged services that combine technologies and services as of december 31 2021 we served 222 million wireless subscribers in north america with more than 202 million in the united states 



our lte technology covers over 434 million people in north america and in the united states we cover all major metropolitan areas and over 330 million people we also provide 4g coverage using another technology hspa and when combined with our upgraded backhaul network we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services in december 2018 we introduced the nation’s first commercial mobile 5g service and expanded that deployment nationwide in july 2020 at december 31 2021 our network covers more than 250 million people with 5g technology in the united states and north america 

our networks covering both the us and mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies’ networks we believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity as of the end of 2021 we provided lte coverage to over 104 million people in mexico 

integration of databroadband and streaming services as the communications industry has evolved into internetbased technologies capable of blending wireline and wireless services we plan to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and provide broadband offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with their mobile service in january 2022 we launched our multigig rollout which brings the fastest internet to att fiber customers with symmetrical 2 gig and 5 gig tiers we will continue to develop and provide unique integrated mobile and broadbandfiber solutions 

regulatory developments 

set forth below is a summary of the most significant regulatory proceedings that directly affected our operations during 2021 industrywide regulatory developments are discussed above in operating environment overview while these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries the words “we” “att” and “our” are used to simplify the discussion the following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues 

international regulation our subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate our licensing compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise ie large business globally and wireless services in mexico 

the general data protection regulation went into effect in europe in may of 2018 att processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers employees of its enterprise customers and its employees this regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance 

federal regulation we have organized our following discussion by service impacted 

internet in february 2015 the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to title ii of the communications act the order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fcc’s authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements in december 2017 the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization on october 1 2019 the dc circuit issued a unanimous opinion upholding the fcc’s reclassification of broadband as an information service and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality because no party sought supreme court review of the dc circuit’s decision to uphold the fcc’s classification of broadband as an information service that decision is final while the court vacated the fcc’s express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality it stressed that its ruling did not prevent the fcc or isps from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the fcc’s regulatory objectives and framework the court also remanded the matter to the fcc for further consideration of the impact of reclassifying broadband services as information services on public safety the lifeline program and pole attachment regulation in october 2020 the fcc adopted an order concluding that those issues did not justify reversing its decision to reclassify broadband services as information services an appeal of the fcc’s remand decision is pending 



following the fcc’s 2017 decision to reclassify broadband as information services a number of states adopted legislation to reimpose the very rules the fcc repealed in some cases state legislation imposes requirements that go beyond the fcc’s february 2015 order additionally some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements suits have been filed concerning laws in california and vermont both lawsuits were stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals of the fcc’s december 2017 order because that order is now final the california suit has returned to active status in january 2021 a us district court in california denied a request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the california law as a consequence the california statute now is in effect the trade associations challenging the statute have appealed the denial of their request for preliminary injunction to the ninth circuit that appeal remains pending the lawsuit regarding the vermont statute has been stayed pending the ninth circuit’s resolution of the appeal or april 15 2022 whichever occurs first we expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet 

privacyrelated legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions legislative regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data 

wireless and broadband in june and november 2020 the fcc issued a declaratory ruling clarifying the limits on state and local authority to deny applications to modify existing structures to accommodate wireless facilities appeals of the november 2020 order remain pending in the ninth circuit court of appeals following multiple requests by the fcc to hold the appeal in abeyance until the senate confirms a fifth fcc commissioner if sustained on appeal these fcc decisions will remove state and local regulatory barriers and reduce the costs of the infrastructure needed for 5g and firstnet deployments which will enhance our ability to place small cell facilities on utility poles expand existing facilities to accommodate public safety services and replace legacy facilities and services with advanced broadband infrastructure and services during 20202021 we have also deployed 5g nationwide on “low band” spectrum on macro towers executing on the recent spectrum purchase we announced ongoing construction and continuing deployment of 5g on cband spectrum in 2022 and beyond 

in march 2020 the fcc released its order setting rules for certain spectrum bands cband for 5g operations in that order the fcc concluded that cband 5g services that met the agency’s technical limits on power and emissions would not cause harmful interference with aircraft operations in reliance on that order att bid a total of 23406 and was awarded 1621 cband licenses including 40 mhz nationwide available for deployment in december 2021 with the remainder available for deployment in december 2023 in late 2021 the federal aviation administration faa questioned whether the cband launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes which operate on spectrum bands over 400 mhz away from the spectrum att is launching in 2022 in response to allow the faa more time to evaluate att and verizon delayed their planned december 2021 5g cband launch by six weeks and voluntarily committed to a series of temporary precautionary measures in addition to deferring turning on a limited number of towers around certain airports on january 19 2022 we launched 5g cband services subject to these voluntary temporary measures 

in recent years the fcc took several actions to make spectrum available for 5g services including the auction of 280 mhz of midband spectrum used for satellite service the “c band” auction and 39 ghz band spectrum att obtained spectrum in these auctions see “other business matters” the fcc also made 150 mhz of midband cbrs spectrum available to be shared with federal incumbents which enjoy priority in addition the fcc recently completed auction 110 in which att won 40 mhz of spectrum nationwide at a cost of 9079 

following enactment in december 2019 of the pallonethune telephone robocall abuse criminal enforcement and deterrence act traced act by congress the fcc adopted new rules requiring voice service providers to implement caller id authentication protocols known as stirshaken and adopt robocall mitigation measures these measures apply to portions of their networks where stirshaken is not enabled in addition to other antirobocall measures the new rules contemplate ongoing fcc oversight and review of efforts related to stirshaken implementation among other goals the fcc has stated its intention to promote the ip transition through its rules 

in september 2019 the fcc released reformed aspects of its intercarrier compensation regime related to tandem switching and transport charges with the goal of reducing the prevalence of telephone access arbitrage schemes in october 2020 the fcc further reformed aspects of its intercarrier compensation regime by greatly reducing and in some cases eliminating the charges long distance carriers must pay to originating carriers for tollfree calls appeals of both orders are pending at the dc circuit court of appeals 



accounting policies and standards 

critical accounting policies and estimates because of the size of the financial statement line items they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others the following policies are presented in the order in which the topics appear in our consolidated statements of income 

pension and postretirement benefits our actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weightedaverage assumptions are discussed in note 15 our assumed weightedaverage discount rates for pension and postretirement benefits of 300 and 280 respectively at december 31 2021 reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants we determined our discount rate based on a range of factors including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred highquality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations these bonds had an average rating of at least aa3 or aa by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations denominated in us dollars and neither callable convertible nor index linked for the year ended december 31 2021 when compared to the year ended december 31 2020 we increased our pension discount rate by 030 resulting in a decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of 1645 and increased our postretirement discount rate by 040 resulting in a decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of 341 

our expected longterm rate of return is 675 on pension plan assets and 450 on postretirement plan assets for 2022 and for 2021 our expected return on plan assets is calculated using the actual fair value of plan assets if all other factors were to remain unchanged we expect that a 050 decrease in the expected longterm rate of return would cause 2022 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase 272 which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns in the current year as part of our fourthquarter remeasurement of our retiree benefit plans 

we recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in “other income expense – net” in our consolidated statements of income these gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years see note 15 for additional discussions regarding our assumptions 

depreciation our depreciation of assets including use of composite group depreciation for certain subsidiaries and estimates of useful lives is described in notes 1 and 7 

if all other factors were to remain unchanged we expect that a oneyear increase in the useful lives of our plant in service would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 2702 in our 2021 depreciation expense and that a oneyear decrease would have resulted in an increase of approximately 3700 in our 2021 depreciation expense see notes 7 and 8 for depreciation and amortization expense applicable to property plant and equipment including our finance lease rightofuse assets 

asset valuations and impairments 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but tested at least annually on october 1 for impairment for impairment testing we estimate fair values using models that predominantly rely on the expected cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit or use of the asset longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life inputs underlying the expected cash flows include but are not limited to subscriber counts revenues from subscriptions advertising and content revenue per user capital investment and acquisition costs per subscriber production and content costs and ongoing operating costs we based our assumptions on a combination of our historical results trends business plans and marketplace participant data 

annual goodwill testing 

goodwill is tested on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value if the fair value exceeds the book value then no impairment is measured we estimate fair values using an income approach also known as a discounted cash flow model and a market multiple approach the income approach utilizes our future cash flow projections with a perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital the market multiple approach uses the multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to those offered by the reporting units 



effective january 1 2021 we updated our reporting units to reflect changes in how warnermedia an integrated content organization that distributes across various platforms is managed and evaluated with this operational change the reporting unit is deemed to be the operating segment the previous reporting units turner home box office warner bros and xandr and the new warnermedia reporting unit were tested for goodwill impairment on january 1 2021 for which there was no impairment identified 

as of october 1 2021 the calculated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their book values in all circumstances however the warnermedia segment fair value exceeded its book value by less than 10 with increased investment in content and distribution expenses affecting fair value for all reporting units if either the projected rate of longterm growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 05 or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 05 the fair values would still be higher than the book value of the goodwill in the event of a 10 drop in the fair values of the reporting units the fair values still would have exceeded the book values of the reporting units for the warnermedia reporting unit as of october 1 2021 if the projected rate of longerterm growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 44 or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 06 it would have resulted in impairment of the goodwill 

us wireless licenses 

the fair value of us wireless licenses is assessed using a discounted cash flow model the greenfield approach and a qualitative collaborative market approach based on auction prices depending upon auction activity the greenfield approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use these licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis consistent with their use on a national scope for the united states for impairment testing we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels with a longterm growth rate reflecting expected longterm inflation trends we assume churn rates will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rates that are in line with industryleading churn we used a discount rate of 925 based on the optimal longterm capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows if either the projected rate of longterm growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 05 or if the discount rate increased by 05 the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value of the licenses the fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10 

other finitelived intangibles 

customer relationships licenses in mexico and other finitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over their remaining life for this analysis we compare the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to its book value when the asset’s book value exceeds undiscounted future cash flows an impairment is recorded to reduce the book value of the asset to its estimated fair value see notes 7 and 9 

vrio business 

in the second quarter of 2021 we classified the vrio disposal group as heldforsale and reported the disposal group at fair value less cost to sell which resulted in a noncash pretax impairment charge of 4555 including approximately 2100 related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments and 2500 related to property plant and equipment and intangible assets approximately 80 of the impairment was attributable to noncontrolling interest vrio was sold in november 2021 resulting in the release of the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income see notes 3 7 and 9 

income taxes our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 14 and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal state or foreign tax authorities 

we use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits utbs in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our utbs may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash 

new accounting standards

other

a significant amount of our cash outflows is related to tax items acquisition of spectrum through fcc auctions and benefits paid for current and former employees 

• total taxes incurred collected and remitted by att during 2021 and 2020 were 21739 and 21967 these taxes include income franchise property sales excise payroll gross receipts and various other taxes and fees

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2021 and the estimated timing of payment are in the following table 



1 represents principal or payoff amounts of notes debentures and credit agreement borrowings at maturity or for puttable debt the next put opportunity see note 12 foreign debt includes the impact from hedges when applicable 

2 includes credit agreement borrowings 

3 we expect to fund the purchase obligations with cash provided by operations or through incremental borrowings consists of commitments primarily related to network programming at warnermedia spectrum acquisitions and other commercial commitments the minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts see note 22 

4 represents operating lease payments see note 8 

5 represents contractual commitment to make sustainability payments over the 25year contract these sustainability payments represent our commitment to fund firstnet’s operating expenses and future reinvestment in the network which we own and operate firstnet has a statutory requirement to reinvest funds that exceed the agency’s operating expenses which we anticipate to be 15000 see note 21 

6 the noncurrent portion of the utbs is included in the “more than 5 years” column as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments if any at this time see note 14 

7 represents future minimum payments under the crown castle and other arrangements see note 19 payables subject to extended payment terms see note 23 and finance lease payments see note 8 

certain items were excluded from this table as the year of payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated since past trends were not deemed to be an indicator of future payment we believe the obligations are immaterial or because the settlement of the obligation will not require the use of cash these items include deferred income tax liability of 65226 see note 14 net postemployment benefit obligations of 13927 including current portion and other noncurrent liabilities of 13409 

contractual obligations at december 31 2021 include approximately 36912 of commitments related to our warnermedia segment which we have entered into an agreement to combine with discovery see note 6 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates these risks along with other business risks impact our cost of capital it is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign exchange exposure in order to manage capital costs control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term in managing market risks we employ derivatives according to documented policies and procedures including interest rate swaps interest rate locks foreign currency exchange contracts and combined interest rate foreign currency contracts crosscurrency swaps we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we do not foresee significant changes in the strategies we use to manage market risk in the near future 



one of the most significant assumptions used in estimating our postretirement benefit obligations is the assumed weightedaverage discount rate which is the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants we determined our discount rate based on a range of factors including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred highquality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations in recent years the discount rates have been increasingly volatile and on average have been lower than in historical periods lower discount rates used to measure our pension and postretirement plans result in higher obligations future increases in these rates could result in lower obligations improved funded status and actuarial gains 

interest rate risk 

the majority of our financial instruments are medium and longterm fixedrate notes and debentures changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of these instruments the principal amounts by expected maturity average interest rate and fair value of our liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk are described in notes 12 and 13 in managing interest expense we control our mix of fixed and floating rate debt through term loans floating rate notes and interest rate swaps we have established interest rate risk limits that we closely monitor by measuring interest rate sensitivities in our debt and interest rate derivatives portfolios 

most of our foreigndenominated longterm debt has been swapped from fixedrate or floatingrate foreign currencies to fixedrate us dollars at issuance through crosscurrency swaps removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments likewise periodically we enter into interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixedrate debt we expect gains or losses in our crosscurrency swaps and interest rate locks to offset the losses and gains in the financial instruments they hedge 

we had no interest rate swaps and no interest rate locks at december 31 2021 

foreign exchange risk 

we principally use foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain film production costs denominated in foreign currencies we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our foreign affiliates and equity investments in foreign companies we have designated €1450 million aggregate principal amount of debt as a hedge of the variability of certain eurodenominated net investments of our subsidiaries the gain or loss on the debt that is designated as and is effective as an economic hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation is recorded as a currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income net on the consolidated balance sheet 

through crosscurrency swaps most of our foreigndenominated debt has been swapped from fixedrate or floatingrate foreign currencies to fixedrate us dollars at issuance removing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments we expect gains or losses in our crosscurrency swaps to offset the gains and losses in the financial instruments they hedge we had crosscurrency swaps with a notional value of 40737 and a fair value of 2959 outstanding at december 31 2021 

for the purpose of assessing specific risks we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations we had foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of 30 and a fair value of 33 outstanding at december 31 2021

areas of focus 

we are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for nextgeneration converged services that combine technologies and services our first responder network authority firstnet contract and our strong spectrum position allow us to execute a progressive 5g deployment strategy with our subscription video on demand streaming platform hbo max we intend to capitalize on our premier network technology and distribution capabilities to provide our premier content in this highly attractive offering our fiber expansion allows us to respond to continuing advances in technology and changing demands from our customers we expect our transition to softwarebased products with low acquisition costs will provide better economics and improve our product portfolio including expansion of streaming services our acquisitions over the past few years and our continued investment in a premier network experience make our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry 

communications 

our integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms including wireless satellite and wireline to provide instant connectivity at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements video streaming is expected to drive greater demand for broadband and capitalize on our fiber deployment these investments have and should continue to prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services including video streaming augmented reality and “smart” technologies during 2021 we will continue to develop and provide highvalue integrated mobile and broadband solutions we believe offering integrated services facilitates our customers’ desire to view content anywhere on demand and encourages customer retention 

wireless service we are experiencing rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet we were awarded the firstnet contract in 2018 which provided us with access to 20 mhz of nationwide low band spectrum and invested in 3739 ghz spectrum in a federal communications commission fcc auction these bands facilitate our 5g services at december 31 2020 our firstnet coverage is more than 80 percent complete with 19 million firstnet connections our 5g service went nationwide in july 2020 and with that availability we anticipate the introduction of 5g handsets and devices will contribute to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades we will continue to invest in our wireless network as we look to provide future service offerings and participate in emerging technologies such as 5g and millimeterwave bands the increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with this technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services we expect that 5g will enhance our customers’ entire connected experience and not just provide faster speeds 

our network covers over 440 million people in north america with 4g lte technology and in the united states our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 330 million people with our lte technology our 3g network provides services to customers using older handsets and connected devices we expect to redeploy spectrum currently used for our 3g services as we transition to 5g service and project that we will discontinue service on our 3g network in early 2022 we will manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades as of december 31 2020 about 5 percent of our postpaid subscribers were using 3g handsets and we expect them to transition to newer technologies we do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results

major classes of service 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total consolidated reported operating revenues by any class of service that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated total operating revenues in any of the last three fiscal years 



additional information on our geographical distribution of revenues is contained in note 4 of item 8 

government regulation 

wireless communications providers in the united states must be licensed by the fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fcc’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the highquality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically ten years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services 



the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of our satellite services which are licensed by the fcc and some of warnermedia’s businesses are also subject to obligations under the communications act and related fcc regulations we continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize andor moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all ipbased networks at the same time we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services which are subject to vigorous competition 

our ilec subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services including local longdistance and network access services provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings in addition many states have adopted legislation that enables us to provide ipbased video service through a single statewide or stateapproved franchise to offer a competitive video product these subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to intercarrier compensation interconnection and interstate and international rates and services including interstate access charges access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers 

our subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided 

the following discussion highlights significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations 

communications segment 

wireless 

the industrywide deployment of 5g technology which is needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access will involve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment and therefore increase the need for local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment on reasonable timelines and terms federal regulations also can delay and impede broadband services including small cell equipment in march august and september 2018 the fcc adopted orders to streamline the wireless infrastructure review process in order to facilitate deployment of nextgeneration wireless facilities specifically the fcc’s march 2018 order streamlined historical tribal and environmental review requirements for wireless infrastructure including the exclusion of most small cell facilities from such review the order was appealed and in august 2019 the dc circuit court of appeals vacated the fcc’s finding that most small cell facilities are excluded from review but otherwise upheld the fcc’s order the fcc’s august and september 2018 orders simplified the regulations for attaching telecommunications equipment to utility poles and clarified when local government rightofway access and use restrictions can be preempted because they unlawfully prohibit the provision of telecommunications services those orders were appealed to the 9th circuit court of appeals which in august 2020 largely upheld the fcc orders those orders have been appealed and the various appeals remain pending in the dc circuit and 9th circuit court of appeals in addition to date 31 states and puerto rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment 

internet 

in february 2015 the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to title ii of the communications act the order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fcc’s authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements in december 2017 the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization on october 1 2019 the dc circuit issued a unanimous opinion upholding the fcc’s reclassification of broadband as an information service and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality while the court vacated the fcc’s express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality it stressed that its ruling did not prevent the fcc or isps from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the fcc’s regulatory objectives and framework the court also remanded the matter to the fcc for further consideration of the impact of reclassifying broadband services as information services on public safety the lifeline program and pole attachment regulation in october 2020 the fcc adopted an order concluding that those issues did not justify reversing its decision to reclassify 



broadband services as information services an appeal of the fcc’s remand decision is pending 

following the fcc’s 2017 decision to reclassify broadband as information services a number of states adopted legislation to reimpose the very rules the fcc repealed in some cases state legislation imposes requirements that go beyond the fcc’s february 2015 order additionally some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements suits have been filed concerning laws in california and vermont both lawsuits were stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals of the fcc’s december 2017 order because that order is now final the california suit has returned to active status nonetheless enforcement of both the california and vermont laws remain stayed pending a ruling by a us district court in california on motions for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the california law argument on those motions is now scheduled for february 2021 we expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet 

privacyrelated legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions legislative regulatory and litigation actions could result in significant penalties increased costs of compliance further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data 

warnermedia segment 

warnermedia creates owns and distributes intellectual property including copyrights trademarks and licenses of intellectual property to protect its intellectual property warnermedia relies on a combination of laws and license agreements outside the us laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country the european union is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives which could impact warnermedia’s activities in the eu piracy particularly of digital content continues to threaten revenues from warnermedia’s products and services as well as revenues from our pay tv business and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including technological and legislative solutions outside the us various laws and regulations as well as trade agreements with the us also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in theaters and on broadcast and cable networks for example in certain countries including china laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year 

additional information relating to regulation of our subsidiaries is contained under the headings “operating environment overview” and “regulatory developments” of item 7 

importance duration and effect of licenses 

certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business many of our subsidiaries also hold governmentissued licenses or franchises to provide wireline satellite or wireless services additional information relating to regulation affecting those rights is contained under the heading “operating environment overview” of item 7 we actively pursue patents trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the united states and abroad we maintain a significant global portfolio of patents trademarks and service mark registrations we have also entered into agreements that permit other companies in exchange for fees and rights and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to utilize certain of our patents trademarks and service marks as we transition our network from a switchbased network to an ip softwarebased network we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers 

we periodically receive offers from third parties to obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also receive notices asserting that our products or services sold to customers or softwarebased network functions infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly such as network functions or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers such as wireless handsets could require us to pay damages royalties stop offering the relevant products or services andor cease network functions or other activities while the outcome of any litigation is uncertain we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or nonrenewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 



major customers 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 or 2018 

competition 

competition continues to increase for communications media entertainment and digital services from traditional and nontraditional competitors technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available in addition lack of or a reduced level of regulation of comparable legacy services has lowered costs for alternative communications service providers as a result we face continuing competition as well as some new opportunities in significant portions of our business 

wireless we face substantial competition in our wireless businesses under current fcc rules multiple licensees who provide wireless services on the cellular pcs advanced wireless services 700 mhz and other spectrum bands may operate in each of our us service areas our competitors include two national wireless providers a larger number of regional providers and resellers of those services and certain cable companies in addition we face competition from providers who offer voice text messaging and other services as applications on data networks we are one of four facilitiesbased providers in mexico retail and wholesale with the most significant market share controlled by américa móvil we may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services while some of these technologies and services are now operational others are being developed or may be developed we compete for customers based principally on servicedevice offerings price network quality coverage area and customer service 

videobroadband our businesses providing communications and digital entertainment services will face continued competitive pressure in 2021 from multiple providers including wireless satellite cable online video providers and resellers in addition the desire for highspeed data on demand including video is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or linear services and use our or competitors’ wireless satellite and internetbased services we have launched our own video ott andor streaming options to attract or retain customers that do not want a fullscale traditional video package in most us markets we compete for customers with large cable companies for highspeed internet video and voice services and other smaller telecommunications companies for both longdistance and local services in addition in latin american countries served by our vrio subsidiary we also face competition from other video providers including américa móvil and telefónica 

legacy voice and data we continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to competitors eg wireless cable and voip providers who can provide comparable services at lower prices because they are not subject to traditional telephone industry regulation or the extent of regulation they are subject to is in dispute utilize different technologies or promote a different business model such as advertisingbased in response to these competitive pressures for a number of years we have used a bundling strategy that rewards customers who consolidate their services with us we continue to focus on bundling services including combined packages of wireless and video service through our ipbased services we will continue to develop innovative and integrated services that capitalize on our wireless and ipbased network 

additionally we provide local and interstate telephone and switched services to other service providers primarily large internet service providers using the largest class of nationwide internet networks internet backbone wireless carriers other telephone companies cable companies and systems integrators these services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies the introduction of innovative offerings and increasing satellite wireless fiberoptic and cable transmission capacity for services we face a number of international competitors including orange business services bt singapore telecommunications limited and verizon communications inc as well as competition from a number of large systems integrators 

media our warnermedia businesses face shifts in consumer viewing patterns increased competition from streaming services and the expansion by other companies in particular technology companies in may 2020 we launched hbo max our platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers as well as through our traditional distributors 



warnermedia competes with other studios and television production groups and independents to produce and sell programming many television networks and online platforms have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their programming which has reduced their demand for programming from nonaffiliated production companies warnermedia also faces competition from other television networks online platforms and premium pay television services for distribution and marketing of its television networks and premium pay and basic tier television services by affiliates 

our warnermedia businesses compete with other production companies and studios for the services of producers directors writers actors and others and for the acquisition of literary properties in recent years technology companies also have begun to produce programming and compete with warnermedia for talent and property rights 

advertising the increased amount of consumer time spent online and on mobile activities has resulted in the shift of advertising budgets away from traditional television to digital advertising warnermedia’s advertisingsupported television networks and digital properties compete with streaming services other networks and digital properties print radio and other media our programmatic advertising business faces competition from a variety of technology companies similar to all participants in the advertising technology sector we contend with the dominance of google as well as the influence of facebook whose practices may result in the decreased ability and willingness of advertisers and programmers to adopt programmatic solutions offered by alternative suppliers 

research and development 

att scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas including ip networking advanced network design and architecture network and cyber security network operations support systems satellite technology video platform development and data analytics the majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers research and development expenses were 1210 in 2020 1276 in 2019 and 1194 in 2018 

human capital 

number of employees as of january 31 2021 we employed approximately 230000 persons 

employee development we believe our success depends on our employees’ success and that all employees must have the skills they need to thrive we offer training and elective courses that give employees the opportunity to enhance their skills we also intend to help cultivate the next generation of talent that will lead our company into the future by providing employees with educational opportunities through our awardwinning internal training organization att university 

labor contracts approximately 37 of our employees are represented by the communications workers of america cwa the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew or other unions after expiration of the collective bargaining agreements work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached there are no significant contracts expiring in 2021 a contract covering approximately 14000 mobility employees in 36 states and the district of columbia that was set to expire in february 2021 was extended until february 2022 a contract covering approximately 10000 mobility employees in nine southeast states that was set to expire in february 2022 was extended until february 2023 

compensation and benefits in addition to salaries we provide a variety of benefit programs to help meet the needs of our employees these programs cover active and former employees and may vary by subsidiary and region these programs include 401k plans pension benefits and health and welfare benefits among many others in addition to our active employee base at december 31 2020 we had approximately 517000 retirees and dependents that were eligible to receive retiree benefits 

we review our benefit plans to maintain competitive packages that reflect the needs of our workforce we also adapt our compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices across our business we are committed to pay equity for employees who hold the same jobs work in the same geographic area and have the same levels of experience and performance 



employee safety we provide our employees access to flexible and convenient health and welfare programs and workplace accommodations in response to the covid19 pandemic we consulted with medical professionals to institute policies that best protected our employees and their families we have prioritized selfcare and emphasized a focus on wellness providing personal protective equipment flexible scheduling or timeoff options and implementing technologies to enhance the necessary remotework environment as we look to life and operations beyond the pandemic we are revising our business models to support flexible office space and athome productivity for many employees on a permanent basis

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the other information set forth in this document including the matters contained under the caption “cautionary language concerning forwardlooking statements” you should carefully read the matters described below we believe that each of these matters could materially affect our business we recognize that most of these factors are beyond our ability to control and therefore we cannot predict an outcome 

macroeconomic factors 

adverse changes in the us securities markets interest rates and medical costs could materially increase our benefit plan costs and future funding requirements 

our costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases primarily due to continuing increases in medical and prescription drug costs and can be affected by lower returns on assets held by our pension and other benefit plans which are reflected in our financial statements for that year in calculating the costs included on our financial statements of providing benefits under our plans we have made certain assumptions regarding future investment returns interest rates and medical costs these assumptions could change significantly over time and could be materially different than originally projected lower than assumed investment returns a decline in interest rates with a corresponding increase in our benefit obligations and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug costs will increase expenses 

the financial accounting standards board requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur we have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income therefore an increase in our costs or adverse market conditions will have a negative effect on our operating results 

significant adverse changes in capital markets could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plans’ funded status and result in increased contribution requirements for such plans which could be material 



adverse changes in global financial markets could limit our ability and our larger customers’ ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operations 

during 2020 uncertainty surrounding global growth rates and the impact of the covid19 pandemic helped create volatility in the credit currency equity and fixed income markets volatility may affect companies’ access to the credit markets leading to higher borrowing costs or in some cases the inability to fund ongoing operations in addition we contract with large financial institutions to support our own treasury operations including contracts to hedge our exposure on interest rates and foreign exchange and the funding of credit lines and other shortterm debt obligations including commercial paper these financial institutions face stricter capitalrelated and other regulations in the united states and europe as well as ongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loan portfolios which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit 

the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 although our securities may provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may adversely affect the current trading market for liborbased securities and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general a company’s cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects while we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions severely affecting our business operations additionally downgrades of our credit rating by the major credit rating agencies could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreements we have entered into with our derivative counterparties which could negatively impact our liquidity further valuation changes in our derivative portfolio due to interest rates and foreign exchange rates could require us to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity 

our international operations have increased our exposure to political instability to changes in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risks could offset our expected growth opportunities 

we have international operations particularly in latin america including mexico and worldwide through warnermedia’s content distribution we need to comply with a wide variety of complex local laws regulations and treaties we are exposed to restrictions on cash repatriation foreign exchange controls fluctuations in currency values changes in relationships between us and foreign governments trade restrictions including potential tariffs differences in intellectual property protection laws and other regulations that may affect materially our earnings our mexico operations in particular rely on a continuation of a regulatory regime that fosters competition while our foreign operations represent significant opportunities to sell our services a number of foreign countries where we operate have experienced unstable growth patterns increased inflation currency devaluation foreign exchange controls instability in the banking sector and high unemployment in addition significant political turmoil has continued in several latin american countries should these conditions persist our ability to offer service in one or more countries could be adversely affected and customers in these countries may be unable to purchase the services we offer or pay for services already provided for example we found it necessary in may 2020 to close our directv operations in venezuela due to political instability in the country and in order to comply with sanctions of the us government 

in addition operating in foreign countries also typically involves participating with local businesses either to comply with local laws or for example to enhance product marketing deploy networks or execute on other capital projects involvement with foreign firms exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the actions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa violations of the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 



industrywide factors 

our business is subject to risks arising from the outbreak of the covid19 virus 

the covid19 pandemic and resulting mitigation measures have caused and may continue to cause a negative effect on our operating results to date mitigation measures have caused sports leagues to modify their seasons and suspend certain operations as the cancellation of many sporting events including the 2020 ncaa tournament which has adversely affected our advertising revenues may result in contract disputes concerning carriage rights and has caused us to incur expenses relating to certain of these sporting events notwithstanding their cancellation the closure or avoidance of theaters and the interruptions in movie production and other programming caused by covid19 are expected to continue to impact the timing of revenues and may cause a loss of revenue to our warnermedia business over the long term the covid19 pandemic could also drive higher costs for our warnermedia business in 2021 based on the hybrid distribution model for releasing films in 2021 and costs associated with safety measures put in place to help provide a safe environment for content production if the mitigation measures or the associated effects are prolonged we expect business customers in industries most significantly impacted will continue to reduce or terminate services having a negative effect on the performance of our business wireline business unit further concerns over the covid19 pandemic could again result in the prolonged closure of many of our retail stores and deter customers from accessing our stores even as the pandemic subsides these pandemic concerns may also result in continued impact to our customers’ ability to pay for our products and services we may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenues due to a downturn in international travel the covid19 pandemic has caused and could further cause reduced staffing levels at our call centers and field operations resulting in delays in service further reductions in staffing levels could additionally limit our ability to provide services adversely impacting our competitive position we may also incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments required to meet higher network utilization from more customers consuming bandwidth from changes in work from home trends extended cancellation periods and increased labor costs if the covid19 pandemic continues for an extended period 

the covid19 pandemic and mitigation measures have caused and may continue to cause adverse impacts on global economic conditions and consumer confidence spending and consumer behavior which could affect demand for our products and services the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning other strains of the virus and the actions to contain its impact due to the speed with which the situation continues to develop and change we are not able at this time to estimate the additional impact of covid19 on our financial or operational results but the impact could be material 

changes to federal state and foreign government regulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings as well as private litigation could further increase our operating costs andor alter customer perceptions of our operations which could materially adversely affect us 

our subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitors are not in addition our subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside the united states are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided our wireless and various video subsidiaries are regulated to varying degrees by the fcc and in some instances by state and local agencies adverse regulations and rulings by the fcc relating to broadband wireless deployment and satellite video issues could impede our ability to manage our networks and recover costs and lessen incentives to invest in our networks the continuing growth of ipbased services especially when accessed by wireless devices has created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcomes unfavorable to us in addition increased public focus on a variety of issues related to our operations such as privacy issues government requests or orders for customer data and concerns about global climate changes have led to proposals or new legislation at state federal and foreign government levels to change or increase regulation on our operations enactment of new privacy laws and regulations could among other things adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisements or result in additional costs of compliance or litigation should customers decide that our competitors offer a more customerfriendly environment our competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 



continuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless video and broadband services will require us to deploy significant amounts of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive services to customers 

wireless video and broadband services are undergoing rapid and significant technological changes and a dramatic increase in usage in particular the demand for faster and seamless usage of video and data across mobile and fixed devices the covid19 pandemic has accelerated these changes and also resulted in higher network utilization as more customers consume bandwidth from changes in work from home trends we must continually invest in our networks in order to improve our wireless video and broadband services to meet this increasing demand and changes in customer expectations while remaining competitive improvements in these services depend on many factors including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these services in order to stem broadband subscriber losses to cable competitors in our nonfiber wireline areas we have been expanding our allfiber wireline network we must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of video data and voice between cell and fixed landline sites to this end we participate in spectrum auctions and continue to deploy software and other technology advancements in order to efficiently invest in our network 

network service enhancements and product launches may not occur as scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors including delays in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standards supplier delays software issues increases in network and handset component costs regulatory permitting delays for tower sites or enhancements or laborrelated delays deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing services if we cannot acquire needed spectrum or deploy the services customers desire on a timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonable costs then our ability to attract and retain customers and therefore maintain and improve our operating margins could be materially adversely affected 

increasing competition for wireless customers could materially adversely affect our operating results 

we have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas and compete for customers based principally on servicedevice offerings price network quality coverage area and customer service in addition we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using advanced wireless technologies and ipbased networks we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates leading to increased competition for customers our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing strategies pursued by competitors we also expect that our customers’ growing demand for highspeed video and data services will place constraints on our network capacity these competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers our ability to respond will depend among other things on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our products and services competitively as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services these efforts will involve significant expenses and require strategic management decisions on and timely implementation of equipment choices network deployment and service offerings 

ongoing changes in the television industry and consumer viewing patterns could materially adversely affect our operating results 

our video subsidiaries derive substantial revenues and profits from cable networks and premium pay television services and the production and licensing of television programming to broadcast and cable networks and premium pay television services the us television industry is continuing to evolve rapidly with developments in technology leading to new methods for the distribution of video content and changes in when where and how audiences consume video content these changes have led to 1 internetbased streaming competitors which are increasing in number and some of which have significant and growing subscriberuser bases and 2 reduced viewers of traditional advertisingsupported television resulting from increased video consumption through svod services including our own timeshifted viewing of television programming and the use of dvrs to skip advertisements the number of subscribers to traditional linear programming in the us has been declining in recent years and the us television industry has generally experienced declines in ratings for programming which have negatively affected subscription and advertising revenues and these trends are expected to continue the popularity of content whether on television on the internet or through movies is difficult to predict and can change rapidly and low public acceptance of our television ott and movie content including warnermedia’s content could adversely affect our results of operations we are taking steps to mitigate the risks from these changes such as the launch of our hbo max directtoconsumer streaming platform and new enhanced advertising opportunities but there can be no assurance that these and other efforts will be successful in responding to these changes 



intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by piracy or be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunities such as new distribution platforms which may materially adversely affect our operations 

increased piracy of video content products and other intellectual property particularly in our foreign warnermedia and latin american operations will decrease revenues mobile and broadband technological developments have made it easier to reproduce and distribute highquality unauthorized copies of content piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and other legal protections or enforcement measures and thieves can attract users throughout the world effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate we may need to spend significant amounts of money to protect our rights we are also increasingly negotiating broader licensing agreements to expand our ability to use new methods to distribute content to customers any impairment of our intellectual property rights including due to changes in us or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures or our inability to negotiate broader distribution rights could materially adversely impact our operations 

incidents leading to damage to our reputation and any resulting lawsuits claims or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we believe that our brand image awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business we strive to create a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and respect and feel comfortable speaking up to report instances of misconduct or other concerns our ability to attract and retain employees is highly dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace ethical business practices and other qualities acts of misconduct by any employee and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us and from any number of activities or circumstances including operations employmentrelated offenses such as sexual harassment and discrimination regulatory compliance and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct we have in the past been and may in the future be named as a defendant in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business based on alleged acts of misconduct by employees these actions seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury including claims for loss of life workers’ compensation employment discrimination sexual harassment workplace misconduct wage and hour claims and other employmentrelated damages compensation for breach of contract statutory or regulatory claims negligence or gross negligence punitive damages consequential damages and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief the outcome of any allegations lawsuits claims or legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of management’s attention from our business additionally our news organization makes editorial judgments around what is covered and how it is covered in the normal course of business although we have disciplined practices that are used to make such editorial judgments it is possible that our news coverage alienates some consumers adversely impacts our reputation and therefore impacts demand for our other products and services any damage to our reputation or payments of significant amounts even if reserved could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

companyspecific financial factors 

adoption of new softwarebased technologies may involve quality and supply chain issues and could increase capital costs 

the communications and digital entertainment industry has experienced rapid changes in the past several years an increasing number of our customers are using mobile devices as the primary means of viewing video and an increasing number of nontraditional video providers are developing content and technologies to satisfy the desire for video entertainment demand in addition businesses and government bodies are broadly shifting to wirelessbased services for homes and infrastructure to improve services to their respective customers and constituencies we are spending significant capital to shift our wired network to softwarebased technology to manage this demand and are expanding 5g wireless technology to address these consumer demands we are entering into a significant number of software licensing agreements and working with software developers to provide network functions in lieu of installing switches or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid developments in video and wireless demand while softwarebased functionality can be changed much more quickly than for example physical switches the rapid pace of development means that we may increasingly need to rely on singlesource and software solutions that have not previously been deployed in production environments should this software not function as intended or our license agreements provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claims we could be forced to either substitute if available or else spend time to develop alternative technologies at a much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability and as a result our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected 



we depend on various suppliers to provide equipment to operate our business and satisfy customer demand and interruption or delay in supply can adversely impact our operating results 

we depend on suppliers to provide us directly or through other suppliers with items such as network equipment customer premises equipment video equipment and wirelessrelated equipment such as mobile hotspots handsets wirelessly enabled computers wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers these suppliers could fail to provide equipment on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations for a number of reasons including difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technologies inability to secure component parts general business disruption natural disasters safety issues economic and political instability and public health emergencies such as the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has caused and may again cause delays in the development manufacturing including the sourcing of key components and shipment of products in certain limited circumstances suppliers have been unable to supply products in a timely fashion in such limited circumstances we have been unable to provide products and services precisely as and when requested by our customers it is possible that in some circumstances we could be forced to switch to a different key supplier because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products of one or more key suppliers with products from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negative effect on our operating results 

increasing costs to provide video and other services could adversely affect operating margins 

our operating costs including customer acquisition and retention costs could continue to put pressure on margins and customer retention levels in addition most of our video programming that we distribute via our linear services is provided by other companies and historically the rates they charge us for programming have often increased more than the rate of inflation in addition as customer viewing habits shift to mobile ondemand and streaming from linear programming negotiating licensing rights is increasingly complicated we are attempting to use our scale and access to wireless customers to change this trend but such negotiations are difficult and also may result in programming disruption our hbo max streaming platform is another component of our strategy to reach nontraditional video customers and we are investing heavily to provide a competitive and attractive offering if we are unable to restrain these costs or provide programming desired by our customers it could impact margins and our ability to attract and retain customers our warnermedia operations which create and license content to other providers also may experience increasing difficulties securing favorable terms including those related to pricing positioning and packaging during contract negotiations which may lead to blackouts of warnermedia programming and warnermedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks and premium pay television services in offerings by third parties 

a number of our competitors offering comparable legacy services that rely on alternative technologies and business models are typically subject to less or no regulation and therefore are able to operate with lower costs these competitors generally can focus on discrete customer segments since they do not have regulatory obligations to provide universal service also these competitors have cost advantages compared to us due in part to operating on newer more technically advanced and lowercost networks and a nonunionized workforce lower employee benefits and fewer retirees we are transitioning services from our old copperbased network and seeking regulatory approvals where needed at both the state and federal levels if we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our network transition or obtain approvals with onerous conditions we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantages 

we may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position 

we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives which are designed to reduce costs streamline distribution remove redundancies and simplify and improve processes and support functions our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience we intend for these efficiencies to enable increased investments in our strategic areas of focus which consist of improving broadband connectivity for example fiber and 5g developing softwarebased entertainment such as hbo max and att tv and utilizing warnermedia’s storytelling legacy to engage consumers and gain insights across multiple distribution points if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits improvements may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operations and competitive position could be adversely affected 



if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers to our new hbo max platform are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

hbo max’s future success is subject to inherent uncertainty our ability to continue to attract subscribers to the hbo max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscribers with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choices furthermore the relative service levels content offerings promotions and pricing and related features of competitors to hbo max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers if consumers do not perceive our offerings to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or offerings terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings experience technical issues or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers in addition many subscribers to these types of offerings originate from wordofmouth advertising from then existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy subscribers are not successful including because we terminate or modify promotional or trialperiod offerings or because of technical issues with the platform we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected 

if subscribers cancel or decide to not continue subscriptions for any reason including a perception that they do not use it sufficiently the need to cut household expenses unsatisfactory availability of content promotions or trialperiod offers expire or are modified competitive services or promotions provide a better value or experience and customer service or technical issues are not satisfactorily resolved our business will be adversely affected we must continually add new subscribers both to replace canceled subscribers and to grow our business if we do not grow as expected given in particular that a significant portion of our content costs are committed and contracted over several years based on minimum subscriber delivery levels we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per subscriber revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in retaining and attracting new subscribers our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers do cancel we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures or offer significantly more generous promotions to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries including at any particular time claims relating to antitrust patent infringement wage and hour personal injury customer privacy violations regulatory proceedings and selling and collection practices we also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards which may entail related investigations and litigation in the wireless area we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effects on customers or employees who use such technologies including for example wireless devices we may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our operations or financial results 

cyberattacks equipment failures natural disasters and terrorist acts may materially adversely affect our operations 

cyberattacks major equipment failures or natural disasters such as flooding hurricanes and forest fires whether caused by discrete severe weather events andor precipitated by longterm climate change and earthquakes software problems terrorist acts or other breaches of network or it security that affect our networks including software and switches microwave links thirdpartyowned local and longdistance networks on which we rely our cell sites or other equipment our satellites our customer account support and information systems or employee and business records could have a material adverse effect on our operations our wired network in particular is becoming increasingly reliant on software as it evolves to handle increasing demands for video transmission while we have been subject to security incidents or cyberattacks these did not result in a material adverse effect on our operations however as such attacks continue to increase in scope and frequency we may be unable to prevent a significant attack in the future our ability to maintain and upgrade our video programming also depends on our ability to successfully deploy and operate video satellites our inability to deploy or operate our networks or customer support systems or protect sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information could result in significant expenses potential legal liability a loss of current or future customers and reputation damage any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 



increases in our debt levels to fund acquisitions additional spectrum purchases or other strategic decisions could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rates and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trends 

we have incurred debt to fund significant acquisitions as well as spectrum purchases needed to compete in our industry while we believe such decisions were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunities and respond to industry developments we did experience creditrating downgrades from historical levels banks and potential purchasers of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decisions and similar actions we may take in the future as well as expected trends in the industry will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand a higher rate of interest impose restrictive covenants or otherwise limit the amount of potential borrowing additionally our capital allocation plan is focused on among other things managing our debt level going forward any failure to successfully execute this plan could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

our business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations judicial interpretations of same or administrative actions by federal state local and foreign taxing authorities 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied in many cases the application of existing newly enacted or amended tax laws such as the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations especially when evaluated against ever changing products and services provided by our global telecommunications media and technology businesses in addition tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate tax liabilities carrying value of deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities any of these changes could materially impact our financial performance and our tax provision net income and cash flows 

we are also subject to ongoing examinations by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions although we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of provisions for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations in the event that we have not accurately or fully described disclosed or determined calculated or remitted amounts that were due to taxing authorities or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued we could be subject to additional taxes penalties and interest which could materially impact our business financial condition and operating results

covid19 update 

disruptions caused by the coronavirus covid19 and measures taken to prevent its spread or mitigate its effects both domestically and internationally have impacted our results of operations we recorded approximately 850 or 010 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2020 of incremental costs associated with voluntary corporate actions taken to protect and compensate frontline employees and contractors and additional warnermedia production disruption 

  

in addition to these incremental costs we estimate that our operations and comparability were impacted by approximately 2925 or 033 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2020 for 1 reluctance of consumers to travel at previous levels driving significantly lower international wireless roaming service revenues that do not have a directly correlated expense reduction 2 the partial closure of movie theaters and postponement of theatrical releases leading to lower content revenues and 3 lower television licensing and production revenues due to production hiatus and associated expenses 

with partial reopening of the economy and improved collections experience the economic effects of the pandemic and resulting societal changes remain unpredictable there are a number of uncertainties that could impact our future results of operations including the effectiveness of covid19 mitigation measures the duration of the pandemic the efficacy and widespread distribution of a vaccine global economic conditions changes to our operations changes in consumer confidence behaviors and spending work and learn from home trends and the sustainability of supply chains we expect operating results and cash flows to continue to be adversely impacted by covid19 for the duration of the pandemic we expect our 2021 results to be impacted by the following 

• lower revenues from the continued partial closure of movie theaters and higher costs based on our decision to distribute 2021 films on hbo max in the us simultaneous with theaters for 31 days and costs associated with the international launch of hbo max 

• uncertainty in revenues from international wireless roaming services due to reduced travel particularly in the first quarter and 

• continued expenses to protect frontline employees contractors and customers 



results of operations 

consolidated results our financial results are summarized in the following table we then discuss factors affecting our overall results additional analysis is discussed in our “segment results” section we also discuss our expected revenue and expense trends for 2021 in the “operating environment and trends of the business” section certain priorperiod amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation 



overview 

operating revenues decreased in 2020 with declines in all segments reflecting impacts of the covid19 pandemic lower warnermedia segment revenues reflect limited and postponed theatrical and home entertainment releases as well as lower television licensing productions and advertising revenues communications segment revenue declines were driven by continued declines in video and legacy services partially offset by higher wireless device sales and increases in strategic and managed business service revenues latin america segment revenue declines were primarily due to foreign exchange rates 

operations and support expenses decreased in 2020 driven by impacts of the pandemic which resulted in lower broadcast and programming costs in our communications and warnerm edia segments and lower filmrelated print and advertising costs at warnermedia also contributing to declines were a noncash gain of 900 on a spectrum transaction in the first quarter that was recorded as an offset to operating expenses as well as our continued focus on cost management offsetting these expense decreases were higher costs associated with our investment in hbo max employee separation charges and incremental costs related to covid19 as part of our cost and efficiency initiatives we expect operations and support expense improvements to continue as we size ou r operations to reflect the current economic activity level 

asset impairments and abandonments inc reased in 2020 primarily due to noncash impairment charges of 15508 in the fourth quarter resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the longlived assets and goodwill associated with our video business see notes 7 and 9 the increase also includes a goodwill impairment of 2212 at our vrio business unit in the second quarter see note 9 and 780 from the impairment of production and other content inventory at warnermedia with approximately 524 resulting from the continued shutdown of theaters during the pandemic and the hybrid distribution model for our 2021 film slate see note 11 charges in 2019 primarily related to the abandonment of certain copper assets that were not necessary to support future network activity see note 7 



depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2020 

amortization expense increased 307 or 39 in 2020 due to the amortization of orbital slot licenses which began in the first quarter of 2020 see note 1 amortization expense in 2021 will reflect approximately 1200 of reductions from the 2020 impairment of orbital slots and customers lists associated with our domestic video business see note 9 

depreciation expense decreased 8 in 2020 primarily due to ongoing capital spend for network upgrades and expansion partially offset by fully depreciated assets in our communications segment depreciation expense in 2021 will reflect approximately 480 of reductions from the 2020 impairment of property plant and equipment associated with our domestic video business see note 7 

operating income decreased in 2020 and increased in 2019 our operating margin was 37 in 2020 compared to 154 in 2019 and 153 in 2018 

interest expense decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower interest rates and debt balances 

equity in net income loss of affiliates increased in 2020 reflecting changes in our investment portfolio including 130 equity in earnings resulting from an investee transaction 

other income expense – net decreased in 2020 primarily due to the recognition of 1405 of debt redemption costs and lower income from rabbi trusts and other investments offsetting the decrease were lower actuarial losses in 2020 4169 compared to 5171 in 2019 see note 15 

income tax expense decreased in 2020 primarily driven by decreased income before income taxes offset by impairments of goodwill see note 9 which are not deductible for tax purposes 

our effective tax rate was 338 in 2020 189 in 2019 and 198 in 2018 the effective tax rate in 2020 was impacted by the goodwill impairments which are not deductible for tax purposes 

segment results our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms andor in different geographies that are managed accordingly our segment results presented below follow our internal management reporting in addition to segment operating contribution we also evaluate segment performance based on ebitda andor ebitda margin ebitda is defined as segment operating contribution excluding equity in net income loss of affiliates and depreciation and amortization we believe ebitda to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate operating performance ebitda does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating contribution nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions reinvestment or other discretionary uses ebitda margin is ebitda divided by total revenues 





operating revenues decreased in 2020 and were impacted by the covid19 pandemic declines in our video broadband and business wireline business units were partially offset by increases in our mobility business unit the decrease also reflects the continued shift away from linear video and legacy services partially offset by higher equipment and service revenues 

operating contribution decreased in 2020 and increased in 2019 the 2020 operating contribution includes declines in our video broadband and business wireline business units and reflects stable operating contribution from our mobility business our communications segment operating income margin was 220 in 2020 226 in 2019 and 223 in 2018 

communications business unit discussion 





the following tables highlight other key measures of performance for mobility 





service revenue increased during 2020 largely due to growth in phone subscribers and connected devices offset by declines in international roaming revenue due to reduced travel during the pandemic successful offers aimed at customer retention contributed to subscriber growth and lower churn 

arpu 

average revenue per subscriber arpu decreased primarily due to the decline in international roaming and waived fees 

churn 

the effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins postpaid churn and postpaid phoneonly churn were lower in 2020 due to migrations to unlimited plans continued network improvements subscriber retention offers in the fourth quarter and lower overall involuntary disconnects 



equipment revenue increased in 2020 primarily due to higher equipment revenue from higher postpaid upgrade volumes the mix of sales of higherpriced smartphones and higher sales of data devices including wearables wireless modems and hotspots 

operations and support expenses increased in 2020 largely driven by higher equipment costs increased commission deferral amortization and intercompany content costs associated with plans offering hbo max partially offset by lower bad debt expense the increase in commission deferral amortization is partly offset by the impacts of our secondquarter 2020 updates to extend the expected economic life of our mobility customers 

depreciation expense increased in 2020 primarily due to ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion partially offset by fully depreciated assets 

operating income increased in 2020 and 2019 our mobility operating income margin was 308 in 2020 314 in 2019 and 306 in 2018 our mobility ebitda margin was 420 in 2020 427 in 2019 and 423 in 2018 

subscriber relationships 

as the wireless industry has matured future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services plans and devices that take advantage of our premier 5g wireless network which went nationwide in july 2020 and to provide these services in bundled product offerings subscribers that purchase two or more services from us have significantly lower churn than subscribers that purchase only one service to support higher mobile data usage our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible 

to attract and retain subscribers in a mature and highly competitive market we have launched a wide variety of plans including our firstnet and prepaid products and arrangements that bundle our video services virtually all of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are on plans that provide for service on multiple devices at reduced rates and subscribers to such plans tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates we offer unlimited data plans and such subscribers also tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates our offerings are intended to encourage existing subscribers to upgrade their current services andor add devices attract subscribers from other providers andor minimize subscriber churn 

connected devices 

connected devices include datacentric devices such as wholesale automobile systems monitoring devices fleet management and sessionbased tablets connected device subscribers increased in 2020 and we added approximately 99 million wholesale connected cars through agreements with various carmakers and experienced strong growth in other internet of things iot connections these connected car agreements give us the opportunity to create future retail relationships with the car owners 





the following tables highlight other key measures of performance for video 





service revenues are comprised of video entertainment subscription and advertising revenues revenues decreased in 2020 and 2019 largely driven by a decline in premium tv and ott subscribers as we continue to focus on retention of existing subscribers with a particular focus on our highvalue subscribers partially offsetting video revenue declines was higher advertising revenues during a general election year consistent with the rest of the industry our customers continue to shift from a premium linear video service to more economically priced ott and subscription video on demand offerings which has impacted our video revenues

operating environment and trends of the business 

2021 revenue trends we expect revenue growth in our wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand premium content instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements through 5g deployment 

in our communications segment we expect that our network quality and first responder network authority firstnet deployment will continue to contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth that 5g handsets will continue to drive wireless equipment revenue growth and that applications like video streaming will also continue to drive greater demand for broadband services the reluctance of consumers to travel at levels prior to the pandemic is expected to continue to contribute to uncertainty in international roaming wireless service revenues 

in our warnermedia segment we expect our video streaming platform hbo max and premium content will continue to drive revenue growth the pandemicrelated partial closure of movie theaters is expected to continue to pressure revenues and higher costs are anticipated based on our decision to distribute our 2021 films on hbo max in the us simultaneous with theaters for 31 days 

across att we expect to provide consumers with a broad variety of video entertainment services from mobilecentric and ott streaming packages to traditional fullsize linear video revenue from business customers is expected to continue to grow for mobile and ipbased services but decline for legacy wireline services overall we believe growth in wireless broadband and warnermedia’s premium content should offset pressure from our linear video and legacy voice and data services 

2021 expense trends we expect the spending required to support growth initiatives primarily our continued deployment of fiber 5g and firstnet build as well as continued investment into the hbo max platform to pressure expense trends in 2021 to the extent 5g handset introductions continue in 2021 and as anticipated the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs during 2021 we will also continue to transition our hardwarebased network technology to more efficient and less expensive softwarebased technology these investments will help prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services including video streaming augmented reality and “smart” technologies the software benefits of our 5g wireless technology and new video delivery platforms should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower networkrelated expenses in the coming years 

we continue to transform our operations to be more efficient and effective reinvesting savings into growth areas of the business we are restructuring businesses sunsetting legacy networks improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels and reassessing overall benefit costs we expect continued savings from these initiatives and through our warnermedia merger synergy program cost savings and nonstrategic asset sales aligns with our focus on debt reduction 

market conditions the us stock market experienced significant volatility in 2020 due to several factors including the global pandemic and thus general business investment remained modest which had impact on our business services the global pandemic has caused and could again cause delays in the development manufacturing including the sourcing of key components and shipment of products as the labor market has not returned to prepandemic levels of unemployment our residential customers continue to be price sensitive in selecting offerings especially in the video area and continue to focus on products that give them efficient access to video and broadcast services most of our products and services are not directly affected by the imposition of tariffs on chinese goods however we expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2021 as we respond to the competitive marketplace especially in wireless and video services 

included on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa we expect only minimal erisa contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2021 investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy and a weakness in the equity fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans in addition our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions however these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in “other income expense – net” changes in our discount rate which are tied to changes in the bond market and changes in the performance of equity markets may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2021 see “critical accounting policies and estimates” 



operating environment overview 

att subsidiaries operating within the united states are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities att subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided 

in the telecommunications act of 1996 telecom act congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare nonetheless over the ensuing two decades the federal communications commission fcc and some state regulatory commissions have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies more recently the fcc has pursued a more deregulatory agenda eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas we continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the state and federal levels to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all ipbased networks at the same time we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services which are subject to vigorous competition 

communications segment 

internet the fcc currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services subject to lighttouch regulation the dc circuit upheld the fcc’s current classification although it remanded three discrete issues to the fcc for further consideration these issues related to the effect of the fcc’s decision to classify broadband services as information services on public safety the regulation of pole attachments and universal service support for lowincome consumers through the lifeline program because no party sought supreme court review of the dc circuit’s decision to uphold the fcc’s classification of broadband as an information service that decision is final 

in october 2020 the fcc adopted an order addressing the three issues remanded by the dc circuit for further consideration after considering those issues the fcc concluded they provided no grounds to depart from its determination that fixed and mobile consumer broadband services should be classified as information services an appeal of the fcc’s remand order is pending 

some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the fcc suits have been filed concerning such laws in two states 

privacyrelated legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions legislative regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data 

wireless the industrywide deployment of 5g technology which is needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access will involve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment and therefore increase the need for local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment on reasonable timelines and terms between 2018 and 2019 the fcc streamlined multiple federal wireless structure review processes with the potential to delay and impede deployment of infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services including small cell equipment recognizing that state and local regulations have the same potential in november 2020 the fcc adopted an order tightening the limits on state and local authority to deny requests to use existing structures for wireless facilities these orders were appealed to the 9 th circuit court of appeals where the appeals remain pending 

in december 2018 we introduced the nation’s first commercial mobile 5g service and in july 2020 we announced nationwide 5g coverage we anticipate the introduction of 5g handsets and devices will contribute to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades 

as the us wireless industry has matured we believe future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services plans and devices we will need a network with sufficient spectrum and capacity and sufficiently broad coverage to support the growth of these services we continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity as well as to secure and utilize spectrum that meets our longterm needs 



video we provide domestic satellite video service through our subsidiary directv whose satellites are licensed by the fcc the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of directv and some of warnermedia’s businesses are also subject to obligations under the communications act and related fcc regulations 

warnermedia segment 

we create own and distribute intellectual property including copyrights trademarks and licenses of intellectual property to protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of laws and license agreements outside of the us laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country the european union commission is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives which could impact warnermedia’s activities in the eu piracy particularly of digital content continues to threaten warnermedia’s revenues from products and services and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including technological and legislative solutions outside the us various laws and regulations as well as trade agreements with the us also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in movie theaters and on broadcast and cable networks for example in certain countries including china laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year 

expected growth areas 

over the next few years we expect our growth to come from wireless softwarebased video offerings like hbo max and ipbased fiber broadband services we provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the us on an integrated telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms in 2021 our key initiatives include 

• continuing expansion of 5g service on our premier wireless network 

• generating mobile subscriber growth from firstnet and our premier network quality 

• increasing subscriber base for hbo max our platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers as well as through other distributors 

• improving fiber penetration and growing broadband revenues 

• continuing to develop a competitive advantage through our corporate cost structure 

• improving profitability in our mexico business unit 

wireless we expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years we are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for nextgeneration converged services that combine technologies and services 

as of december 31 2020 we served 202 million wireless subscribers in north america with more than 182 million in the united states our lte technology covers over 440 million people in north america and in the united states we cover all major metropolitan areas and over 330 million people we also provide 4g coverage using another technology hspa and when combined with our upgraded backhaul network we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services in december 2018 we introduced the nation’s first commercial mobile 5g service and expanded that deployment nationwide in july 2020 

our networks covering both the us and mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies’ networks we believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity as of the end of 2020 we provided lte coverage to over 110 million people in mexico 

integration of databroadband and entertainment services as the communications industry has evolved into internetbased technologies capable of blending wireline and wireless services we plan to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and provide highspeed internet and video offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with their mobile service during 2021 we will continue to develop and provide unique integrated video mobile and broadband solutions the launch of the hbo max platform has facilitated our customers’ desire to view video anywhere on demand and has encouraged customer retention 



regulatory developments 

set forth below is a summary of the most significant regulatory proceedings that directly affected our operations during 2020 industrywide regulatory developments are discussed above in operating environment overview while these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries the words “we” “att” and “our” are used to simplify the discussion the following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues 

international regulation our subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate our licensing compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise ie large business wireless and satellite television services att is engaged in multiple efforts with foreign regulators to open markets to competition foster conditions favorable to investment and increase our scope of services and products 

the general data protection regulation went into effect in europe in may of 2018 att processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers employees of its enterprise customers and its employees this regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance 

federal regulation we have organized our following discussion by service impacted 

internet in february 2015 the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to title ii of the communications act the order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fcc’s authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements in december 2017 the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization on october 1 2019 the dc circuit issued a unanimous opinion upholding the fcc’s reclassification of broadband as an information service and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality while the court vacated the fcc’s express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality it stressed that its ruling did not prevent the fcc or isps from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the fcc’s regulatory objectives and framework the court also remanded the matter to the fcc for further consideration of the impact of reclassifying broadband services as information services on public safety the lifeline program and pole attachment regulation in october 2020 the fcc adopted an order concluding that those issues did not justify reversing its decision to reclassify broadband services as information services an appeal of the fcc’s remand decision is pending 

following the fcc’s 2017 decision to reclassify broadband as information services a number of states adopted legislation to reimpose the very rules the fcc repealed in some cases state legislation imposes requirements that go beyond the fcc’s february 2015 order additionally some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements suits have been filed concerning laws in california and vermont both lawsuits were stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals of the fcc’s december 2017 order because that order is now final the california suit has returned to active status nonetheless enforcement of both the california and vermont laws remains stayed pending a ruling by a us district court in california on motions for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the california law argument on those motions is now scheduled for february 2021 we expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet 

wireless and broadband in june and november 2020 the fcc issued a declaratory ruling clarifying the limits on state and local authority to deny applications to modify existing structures to accommodate wireless facilities appeals of the november 2020 order remain pending in the 9 th circuit court of appeals if sustained on appeal these fcc decisions will remove state and local regulatory barriers and reduce the costs of the infrastructure needed for 5g and firstnet deployments which will enhance our ability to place small cell facilities on utility poles expand existing facilities to accommodate public safety services and replace legacy facilities and services with advanced broadband infrastructure and services 



in 2020 the fcc took several actions to make spectrum available for 5g services first the fcc completed the auction of the 39 ghz band in large contiguous blocks of spectrum that will support 5g att obtained spectrum in this auction which also included spectrum in the 37 ghz and 47 ghz bands see “other business matters” the fcc also made 150 mhz of midband cbrs spectrum available to be shared with federal incumbents who enjoy priority furthermore the fcc began the auction of 280 mhz of midband spectrum presently used for satellite service the “c band” auction this auction is expected to conclude by june of 2021 other midband spectrum auctions are planned for later in 2021 

following enactment in december 2019 of the pallonethune telephone robocall abuse criminal enforcement and deterrence act traced act by congress the fcc adopted new rules requiring voice service providers to implement caller id authentication protocols known as stirshaken and adopt robocall mitigation measures these measures apply to portions of their networks where stirshaken is not enabled in addition to other antirobocall measures the new rules contemplate ongoing fcc oversight and review of efforts related to stirshaken implementation among other goals the fcc has stated its intention to promote the ip transition through its rules 

in september 2019 the fcc released reformed aspects of its intercarrier compensation regime related to tandem switching and transport charges with the goal of reducing the prevalence of telephone access arbitrage schemes in october 2020 the fcc further reformed aspects of its intercarrier compensation regime by greatly reducing and in some cases eliminating the charges long distance carriers must pay to originating carriers for tollfree calls appeals of both orders are pending at the dc circuit court of appeals 

accounting policies and standards 

critical accounting policies and estimates because of the size of the financial statement line items they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others the following policies are presented in the order in which the topics appear in our consolidated statements of income 

pension and postretirement benefits our actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weightedaverage assumptions are discussed in note 15 our assumed weightedaverage discount rates for pension and postretirement benefits of 270 and 240 respectively at december 31 2020 reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants we determined our discount rate based on a range of factors including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred highquality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations these bonds were all rated at least aa3 or aa by one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations denominated in us dollars and neither callable convertible nor index linked for the year ended december 31 2020 when compared to the year ended december 31 2019 we decreased our pension discount rate by 070 resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of 5594 and decreased our postretirement discount rate by 080 resulting in an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of 1311 

our expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is 675 for 2021 and 700 for 2020 our expected longterm rate of return on postretirement plan assets is 450 for 2021 and 475 for 2020 our expected return on plan assets is calculated using the actual fair value of plan assets if all other factors were to remain unchanged we expect that a 050 decrease in the expected longterm rate of return would cause 2021 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase 277 which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns in the current year as part of our fourthquarter remeasurement of our retiree benefit plans 

we recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in “other income expense – net” in our consolidated statements of income these gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years see note 15 for additional discussions regarding our assumptions 

depreciation our depreciation of assets including use of composite group depreciation for certain subsidiaries and estimates of useful lives is described in notes 1 and 7 



if all other factors were to remain unchanged we expect that a oneyear increase in the useful lives of our plant in service would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 3128 in our 2020 depreciation expense and that a oneyear decrease would have resulted in an increase of approximately 4353 in our 2020 depreciation expense see notes 7 and 8 for depreciation and amortization expense applicable to property plant and equipment including our finance lease rightofuse assets 

asset valuations and impairments 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but tested at least annually on october 1 for impairment for impairment testing we estimate fair values using models that predominantly rely on the expected cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit or use of the asset longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicated that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life inputs underlying the expected cash flows include but are not limited to subscriber counts revenues from subscriptions advertising and content revenue per user capital investment and acquisition costs per subscriber production and content costs and ongoing operating costs we based our assumptions on a combination of our historical results trends business plans and marketplace participant data

goodwill is tested on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value if the fair value exceeds the book value then no impairment is measured we estimate fair values using an income approach also known as a discounted cash flow model and a market multiple approach the income approach utilizes our future cash flow projections with a perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital the market multiple approach uses the multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to those offered by the reporting units as of october 1 2020 the calculated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their book values in all circumstances however the turner hbo and entertainment group prior to our december reporting unit change discussed below fair values exceed their book values by less than 10 with covid19 impacts industry trends and our content distribution strategy affecting fair value for the reporting units with fair value in excess of 10 of book value if either the projected rate of longterm growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 05 or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 05 the fair values would still be higher than the book value of the goodwill in the event of a 10 drop in the fair values of the reporting units the fair values still would have exceeded the book values of the reporting units for the turner and hbo reporting units as of october 1 2020 if the projected rate of longerterm growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 1 and more than 2 respectively or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 05 it would result in impairment of the goodwill carrying values of the reporting units in the warnermedia segment turner hbo and warner bros decrease as intangibles identified in the acquisition are amortized 

domestic video business 

in december 2020 we changed our management strategy and reevaluated our domestic video business allowing us to maximize value in our domestic video business and further accelerate our ability to innovate and execute in our fastgrowing broadband and fiber business the strategy change required us to re assess the grouping and recoverability of the video business longlived assets in conjunction with the strategy change we separated the former entertainment group into two business units video and broadband which includes legacy telephony operations these changes required us to identify a separate video reporting unit which required evaluating assigned goodwill for impairment while first assessing any impairment of goodwill at the historical entertainment group level 

the fair value of longlived assets was determined primarily using the present value approach of probabilityweighted expected cash flow we determined that these assets were no longer recoverable and recognized an impairment to their estimated fair value a pretax impairment of 7255 4373 orbital slots 1201 customer lists and 1681 in property plant and equipment was assigned to the longlived assets of the video business see notes 7 and 9 upon updating the carrying value of the video business we were then required to reperform our goodwill impairment testing of the historical entertainment group reporting unit as of december 31 2020 and before separation into the two reporting units where we again concluded that no impairment was required consistent with the testing as of october 1 2020 gaap requires ongoing fair value assessments for recoverability upon defined triggering events 

we further concluded that our video business should be identified as a separate reporting unit within the communications segment the change in reporting unit required the historical entertainment group goodwill to be assigned to the separate video and broadband reporting units for which we used the relative fair value allocation methodology the affected reporting units were then tested for goodwill impairment we recorded an impairment of the entire 8253 of goodwill allocated to the video reporting unit no goodwill impairment was required in the broadband reporting unit see note 9 



in total w e recorded an impairment charge of 15508 7255 for longlived assets and 8253 of assigned goodwill in december 2020 results 

us wireless licenses 

the fair value of us wireless licenses is assessed using a discounted cash flow model the greenfield approach and a corroborative market approach based on auction prices depending upon auction activity the greenfield approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use these licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis consistent with their use on a national scope for the united states for impairment testing we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels with a longterm growth rate reflecting expected longterm inflation trends we assume churn rates will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rates that are in line with industryleading churn we used a discount rate of 925 based on the optimal longterm capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows if either the projected rate of longterm growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 05 or if the discount rate increased by 05 the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value of the licenses the fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10 

other finitelived intangibles 

customer relationships licenses in mexico certain trade names in our latin america business and other finitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over their remaining life for this analysis we compare the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to its book value when the asset’s book value exceeds undiscounted future cash flows an impairment is recorded to reduce the book value of the asset to its estimated fair value see notes 7 and 9 

vrio goodwill 

in the second quarter of 2020 driven by significant and adverse economic and political environments in latin america including the impact of the covid19 pandemic we experienced accelerated subscriber losses and revenue decline in the region as well as closure of our operations in venezuela when combining these business trends and higher weightedaverage cost of capital resulting from the increase in countryrisk premiums in the region we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the vrio reporting unit estimated using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches is less than its carrying amount we recorded a 2212 goodwill impairment the entire amount of goodwill allocated to the vrio reporting unit with 105 attributable to noncontrolling interest see note 9 

orbital slots 

during the first quarter of 2020 in conjunction with the nationwide launch of att tv and our customers’ continued shift from linear to streaming video services we reassessed the estimated economic lives and renewal assumptions for our orbital slot licenses as a result we changed the estimated lives of these licenses from indefinite to finitelived effective january 1 2020 and amortized 1504 of the orbital slots in 2020 see note 1 

income taxes our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 14 and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal state or foreign tax authorities 

we use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits utbs in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our utbs may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash 

new accounting standards 

beginning with 2020 interim and annual reporting periods we adopted the fasb’s new accounting guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on trade receivables loans contract assets and certain other assets not subject fair value measurement existing at january 1 2020 we adopted the standard using a modified retrospective approach as of the beginning of the period of adoption which did not require us to adjust the balance for prior periods therefore affecting the comparability of our financial statements upon adoption we recorded an increase to our allowances for credit losses primarily for trade and loan receivables see note 1 for discussion of the impact of the standard

credit facilities 

the following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k

we also utilize other external financing sources which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program 

each of our credit and loan agreements contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debttoebitda financial ratio covenant requiring us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of not more than 35to1 as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities 

collateral arrangements

other 

our total capital consists of debt longterm debt and debt maturing within one year and stockholders’ equity our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investment at december 31 2020 our debt ratio was 467 compared to 447 at december 31 2019 and 477 at december 31 2018 our net debt ratio was 438 at december 31 2020 compared to 414 at december 31 2019 and 462 at december 31 2018 the debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital and reflects our recent debt issuances and repayments and debt acquired in business combinations 

a significant amount of our cash outflows is related to tax items acquisition of spectrum through fcc auctions and benefits paid for current and former employees 

• total taxes incurred collected and remitted by att during 2020 and 2019 were 21967 and 24170 these taxes include income franchise property sales excise payroll gross receipts and various other taxes and fees 

• total domestic spectrum acquired primarily through fcc auctions including cash exchanged spectrum and auction deposits was approximately 2800 in 2020 1300 in 2019 and 450 in 2018 

• total health and welfare benefits provided to certain active and retired employees and their dependents totaled 3656 in 2020 with 1029 paid from plan assets of those benefits 3293 related to medical and prescription drug benefits in addition in 2020 we prefunded 745 for future benefit payments during 2020 we paid 5124 of pension benefits out of plan assets 



during 2020 we have received 3641 from the disposition of assets and when combined with working capital monetization initiatives which include the sale of receivables total cash received from monetization efforts net of 1613 of spectrum acquisitions was approximately 1100 we plan to continue to explore similar opportunities 

contractual obligations commitments and contingencies 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 are in the following table 



1 represents principal or payoff amounts of notes and debentures at maturity or for putable debt the next put opportunity see note 12 foreign debt includes the impact from hedges when applicable 

2 we expect to fund the purchase obligations with cash provided by operations or through incremental borrowings the minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts if we elect to exit these contracts termination fees for all such contracts in the year of termination could be approximately 259 in 2021 257 in the aggregate for 2022 and 2023 and 64 in the aggregate for 2024 and 2025 and 1987 in the aggregate thereafter certain termination fees are excluded from the above table as the fees would not be paid every year and the timing of such payments if any is uncertain see note 21 

3 represents operating lease payments see note 8 

4 represents contractual commitment to make sustainability payments over the 25year contract these sustainability payments represent our commitment to fund firstnet’s operating expenses and future reinvestment in the network which we own and operate firstnet has a statutory requirement to reinvest funds that exceed the agency’s operating expenses which we anticipate to be 15000 see note 20 

5 the noncurrent portion of the utbs is included in the “more than 5 years” column as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of additional cash payments if any at this time see note 14 

6 represents future minimum payments under the crown castle and other arrangements see note 19 payables subject to extended payment terms see note 22 and finance lease payments see note 8 

certain items were excluded from this table as the year of payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated since past trends were not deemed to be an indicator of future payment we believe the obligations are immaterial or because the settlement of the obligation will not require the use of cash these items include deferred income tax liability of 60472 see note 14 net postemployment benefit obligations of 19690 expected pension and postretirement payments see note 15 and other noncurrent liabilities of 11829

we believe the following measure is relevant and useful information to investors as it is used by management as a method of comparing performance with that of many of our competitors this supplemental measure should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute of our consolidated and segment financial information 

business solutions reconciliation 

we provide a supplemental discussion of our business solutions operations that is calculated by combining our mobility and business wireline business units and then adjusting to remove nonbusiness operations the following table presents a reconciliation of our supplemental business solutions results results have been recast to conform to the current periods classification 














 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates these risks along with other business risks impact our cost of capital it is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign exchange exposure in order to manage capital costs control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term in managing market risks we employ derivatives according to documented policies and procedures including interest rate swaps interest rate locks foreign currency exchange contracts and combined interest rate foreign currency contracts crosscurrency swaps we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we do not foresee significant changes in the strategies we use to manage market risk in the near future 

one of the most significant assumptions used in estimating our postretirement benefit obligations is the assumed weightedaverage discount rate which is the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants we determined our discount rate based on a range of factors including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred highquality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations in recent years the discount rates have been increasingly volatile and on average have been lower than in historical periods lower discount rates used to measure our pension and postretirement plans result in higher obligations future increases in these rates could result in lower obligations improved funded status and actuarial gains 

interest rate risk 

the majority of our financial instruments are medium and longterm fixedrate notes and debentures changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of these instruments the principal amounts by expected maturity average interest rate and fair value of our liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk are described in notes 12 and 13 in managing interest expense we control our mix of fixed and floating rate debt through term loans floating rate notes and interest rate swaps we have established interest rate risk limits that we closely monitor by measuring interest rate sensitivities in our debt and interest rate derivatives portfolios 

most of our foreigndenominated longterm debt has been swapped from fixedrate or floatingrate foreign currencies to fixedrate us dollars at issuance through crosscurrency swaps removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments likewise periodically we enter into interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixedrate debt we expect gains or losses in our crosscurrency swaps and interest rate locks to offset the losses and gains in the financial instruments they hedge 

we had no interest rate swaps and no interest rate locks at december 31 2020 

foreign exchange risk 

we principally use foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain film production costs denominated in foreign currencies we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our foreign affiliates and equity investments in foreign companies we have designated €1450 million aggregate principal amount of debt as a hedge of the variability of certain eurodenominated net investments of our subsidiaries the gain or loss on the debt that is designated as and is effective as an economic hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation is recorded as a currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income net on the consolidated balance sheet 

through crosscurrency swaps most of our foreigndenominated debt has been swapped from fixedrate or floatingrate foreign currencies to fixedrate us dollars at issuance removing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments we expect gains or losses in our crosscurrency swaps to offset the gains and losses in the financial instruments they hedge we had crosscurrency swaps with a notional value of 40745 and a fair value of 93 outstanding at december 31 2020 

for the purpose of assessing specific risks we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations we had foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of 90 and a fair value of 3 outstanding at december 31 2020

areas of focus 

we are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for nextgeneration converged services that combine technologies and services our first responder network authority firstnet contract and our strong spectrum position allows us to execute a different 5g deployment strategy with our upcoming launch of hbo max we will capitalize on our premier network technology and distribution capabilities to provide our premier content in this unique offering our recent fiber expansion allows us to respond to continuing advances in technology and changing demands from our customers we expect our transition to softwarebased products with low acquisition costs will provide better economics and improve our product portfolio including expansion into streaming tv our acquisitions over the past few years and our continued investment in a premier network experience make our customers’ 

  

   

lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2020 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below 

  

communications 

our integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms including wireless satellite and wireline to provide instant connectivity and at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements video streaming will also drive greater demand for broadband and capitalize on our fiber deployment these investments prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services including video streaming augmented reality and “smart” technologies during 2020 we will continue to develop and provide highvalue integrated video mobile and broadband solutions we believe offering integrated services facilitates our customers’ desire to view video anywhere on demand and encourages customer retention 

  

wireless service we are experiencing rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet we were awarded the firstnet contract which provides us with access to 20 mhz of nationwide low band spectrum and invested in 5g and millimeterwave technologies with our acquisition of fibertower corporation which currently holds significant amounts of spectrum in the millimeter wave bands 39 ghz that the us federal communications commission fcc reallocated for mobile broadband services these bands will help to accelerate our entry into 5g services at december 31 2019 our firstnet coverage is approximately 75 percent complete with more than 10 million firstnet connections we expect to have mobile 5g service nationwide to more than 200 million people by the second quarter 2020 and with that availability we anticipate the introduction of 5g handsets and devices will contribute to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades we will continue to invest in our wireless network as we look to provide future service offerings and participate in technologies such as 5g and millimeterwave bands the increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with this technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services we expect that 5g will enhance our customers’ entire connected experience and not just provide faster speeds 

  

our network covers over 430 million people in north america with 4g lte technology and in the united states our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 330 million people with our lte technology our 3g network provides services to customers using older handsets and connected devices we expect to redeploy spectrum currently used for our 3g services as we transition to 5g service and project that we will discontinue service on our 3g network in early 2022 we will manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades as of december 31 2019 about 7 percent of our postpaid subscribers were using 3g handsets and we expect them to transition to newer technologies we do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 

  

as the wireless industry has matured future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services on a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations we continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our longterm needs we have participated in recent fcc spectrum auctions including the 24 ghz auction in 2019 and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services 

  

broadband technology we are rapidly converting to a softwarebased network and managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology softwarebased technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network sdn and network function virtualization nfv this network approach of which we are a global leader in our commitment to virtualize 75 percent of our network by the end of 2020 delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of nextgeneration technology over the traditional hardwareintensive network approach our virtualized network will be able to support nextgeneration applications like 5g and broadbandbased services quickly and efficiently 

  

  

   

media 

we produce and distribute highquality video content to take advantage of growing global demand our media businesses use their strong brands distinctive intellectual property and global scale to produce and distribute quality content as the television industry continues to evolve from a distribution system using satellite and cable offerings to internet streaming video services we are wellpositioned to address and capitalize on these changes but we face financial risks and new sources of competition associated with these developments we plan in 2020 to continue launching more personalized services offered directly to consumers through our own distribution and distribution partner channels including our streaming platform hbo max scheduled for launch in may 2020 att customers on premium video mobile and broadband services will be offered bundles with hbo max included at no additional charge we also plan to add an advertisingsupported hbo max offering to take advantage of our advertising capabilities in the future we also plan to provide hbo max subscribers with unique live interactive and special event programming 

  

advertising 

our xandr segment relies on using data from our 170 million customer relationships to deliver digital and video advertising that is more relevant to consumers advertisers are interested in capitalizing on our broad video distribution and ability to offer more precise marketing to customers through a digital platform we also are expanding relationships with other video providers and digital publishers to use our platforms to reach their audiences we believe this segment will benefit from the nationwide election cycle in 2020 

  

latin america 

we believe that the wireless model in the us with accelerating demand for mobile internet service and the associated economic benefits will be repeated around the world as companies invest in highspeed mobile networks due in part to changes in the legal and regulatory framework in mexico in 2015 we acquired mexican wireless operations to establish a seamless crossborder north american wireless network covering an area with over 430 million people and businesses in the united states and mexico our 4g lte network in mexico now covers approximately 100 million people and businesses our vrio business unit provides video services to primarily residential customers using satellite technology in latin america and the caribbean we have approximately 13 million video subscribers in latin america

government regulation 

wireless communications providers in the united states must be licensed by the fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fcc’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the highquality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically ten years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services 

  

the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of our satellite services which are licensed by the fcc and some of warnermedia’s businesses are also subject to obligations under the communications act and related fcc regulations 

  

our ilec subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services including local longdistance and network access services provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings in addition many states have adopted legislation that enables us to provide ipbased video service through a single statewide or stateapproved franchise to offer a competitive video product these subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to intercarrier compensation interconnection and interstate and international rates and services including interstate access charges access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers 

  

our subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided 

  

the following discussion highlights significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations 

  

communications segment 

  

wireless 

the industrywide deployment of 5g technology which is needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access will involve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment and therefore increase the need for local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment on reasonable timelines and terms federal regulations also can delay and impede broadband services including small cell equipment in march august and september 2018 the fcc adopted orders to streamline the wireless infrastructure review process in order to facilitate deployment of nextgeneration wireless facilities those orders have been appealed and the various appeals remain pending in the dc circuit and 9th circuit court of appeals in addition to date 28 states and puerto rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment 

  

internet 

in february 2015 the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to title ii of the communications act this order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fcc’s authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements in december 2017 the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization several parties appealed the fcc’s december 2017 decision on october 1 2019 the dc circuit issued a unanimous opinion upholding the fcc’s reclassification of broadband as an information service and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality while the court vacated the fcc’s express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality it nevertheless stressed that its ruling does not prevent the fcc or isps from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the fcc’s regulatory objectives and framework the court also concluded that the fcc failed to satisfy its obligation under the administrative procedure act apa to consider the impact of its 2017 order in three discrete areas—public safety the lifeline program and pole attachment regulation—and thus remanded it to the fcc for further proceedings on those issues 

  

   

but without disturbing the operative effect of that order a number of states have adopted legislation that would reimpose the very rules the fcc repealed and in some cases establish additional requirements that go beyond the fcc’s february 2015 order additionally some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements suits have recently been filed concerning laws in california and vermont and other lawsuits are possible the california and vermont suits have been stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending resolution of appeals of the fcc’s december 2017 order if no one seeks rehearing or supreme court review of the dc circuit’s decision the foregoing litigation will recommence we expect that additional states may seek to regulate net neutrality based on the dc circuit’s decision we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet 

  

privacyrelated legislation has been adopted or considered in a number of states legislative and regulatory action could result in increased costs of compliance claims against broadband internet access service providers and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data effective as of january 1 2020 a california state law gives california consumers the right to know what personal information is being collected about them and whether and to whom it is sold or disclosed and to access and request deletion of this information subject to certain exceptions it also gives consumers the right to optout of the sale of personal information 

  

warnermedia segment 

  

warnermedia creates owns and distributes intellectual property including copyrights trademarks and licenses of intellectual property to protect its intellectual property warnermedia relies on a combination of laws and license agreements outside the us laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country the european union commission is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives that could impair warner bros’ current countrybycountry licensing approach in the european union piracy particularly of digital content continues to threaten revenues from warnermedia’s products and services as well as revenues from our pay tv business and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including technological and legislative solutions outside the us various laws and regulations as well as trade agreements with the us also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in theaters and on broadcast and cable networks for example in certain countries including china laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year 

  

additional information relating to regulation of our subsidiaries is contained under the headings “operating environment overview” and “regulatory developments” of item 7 

  

importance duration and effect of licenses 

  

certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business many of our subsidiaries also hold governmentissued licenses or franchises to provide wireline satellite or wireless services additional information relating to regulation affecting those rights is contained under the heading “operating environment overview” of item 7 we actively pursue patents trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the united states and abroad we maintain a significant global portfolio of patents trademarks and service mark registrations we have also entered into agreements that permit other companies in exchange for fees and rights and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to utilize certain of our patents trademarks and service marks as we transition our network from a switchbased network to an ip softwarebased network we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers 

  

we periodically receive offers from third parties to obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for royalties or other payments we also receive notices asserting that our products or services sold to customers or softwarebased network functions infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights these claims whether against us directly such as network functions or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers such as wireless handsets could require us to pay damages royalties stop offering the relevant products or services andor cease network functions or other activities while the outcome of any litigation is uncertain we do not 

  

   

believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or nonrenewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

major customers 

  

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in 2019 2018 or 2017 

  

  

competition 

  

competition continues to increase for communications media entertainment and digital services from traditional and nontraditional competitors technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available in addition lack of or a reduced level of regulation of comparable legacy services has lowered costs for alternative communications service providers as a result we face continuing competition as well as some new opportunities in significant portions of our business 

  

wireless we face substantial competition in our wireless businesses under current fcc rules multiple licensees who provide wireless services on the cellular pcs advanced wireless services 700 mhz and other spectrum bands may operate in each of our us service areas our competitors include three national wireless providers a larger number of regional providers and resellers of those services and specifically certain cable companies in addition we face competition from providers who offer voice text messaging and other services as applications on data networks substantially all of the us population lives in areas with at least three mobile telephone operators with most of the population living in areas with at least four competing carriers we are one of three facilitiesbased providers in mexico with the most significant market share controlled by américa móvil we may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services while some of these technologies and services are now operational others are being developed or may be developed we compete for customers based principally on servicedevice offerings price network quality coverage area and customer service 

  

videobroadband our subsidiaries providing communications and digital entertainment services will face continued competitive pressure in 2020 from multiple providers including wireless satellite cable online video providers and resellers in addition the desire for highspeed data on demand including video is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or linear services and use our or competitors’ wireless satellite and internetbased services we have launched our own video ott andor streaming options to attract or retain customers that do not want a fullscale traditional video package in most us markets we compete for customers with large cable companies for highspeed internet video and voice services and other smaller telecommunications companies for both longdistance and local services in addition in latin american countries served by our directv subsidiary we also face competition from other video providers including américa móvil and telefónica 

  

legacy voice and data we continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to competitors eg wireless cable and voip providers who can provide comparable services at lower prices because they are not subject to traditional telephone industry regulation or the extent of regulation they are subject to is in dispute utilize different technologies or promote a different business model such as advertising based in response to these competitive pressures for a number of years we have used a bundling strategy that rewards customers who consolidate their services with us we continue to focus on bundling services including combined packages of wireless and video service through our satellite and ipbased services we will continue to develop innovative and integrated services that capitalize on our wireless and ipbased network and satellites 

  

additionally we provide local and interstate telephone and switched services to other service providers primarily large internet service providers using the largest class of nationwide internet networks internet backbone wireless carriers other telephone companies cable companies and systems integrators these services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies the introduction of innovative offerings and increasing satellite wireless fiberoptic and cable transmission capacity for services we face a number of international competitors including orange business services bt singapore telecommunications limited and verizon communications inc as well as competition from a number of large systems integrators 

  

media our warnermedia businesses face similar shifts in consumer viewing patterns increased competition from streaming services and the expansion by other companies in particular technology companies in may 2020 we plan to launch hbo 

  

   

max our new platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers as well as through our traditional distributors 

  

warnermedia competes with other studios and television production groups and independents to produce and sell programming many television networks and online platforms have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their programming which has reduced their demand for programming from nonaffiliated production companies warnermedia also faces competition from other television networks online platforms and premium pay television services for distribution and marketing of its television networks and premium pay and basic tier television services by affiliates 

  

our warnermedia businesses compete with other production companies and studios for the services of producers directors writers actors and others and for the acquisition of literary properties in recent years technology companies also have begun to produce programming and compete with warnermedia for talent and property rights 

  

advertising the increased amount of consumer time spent online and on mobile activities has resulted in the shift of advertising budgets away from traditional television to digital advertising warnermedia’s advertisingsupported television networks and digital properties compete with streaming services other networks and digital properties print radio and other media our programmatic advertising business faces competition from a variety of technology companies similar to all participants in the advertising technology sector we contend with the dominance of google as well as the influence of facebook whose practices may result in the decreased ability and willingness of advertisers and programmers to adopt programmatic solutions offered by alternative suppliers 

  

research and development 

  

att scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas including ip networking advanced network design and architecture network and cyber security network operations support systems satellite technology video platform development and data analytics the majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers research and development expenses were 1276 in 2019 1194 in 2018 and 1503 in 2017 

  

employees 

  

as of january 31 2020 we employed approximately 246000 persons approximately 40 of our employees are represented by the communications workers of america cwa the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew or other unions after expiration of the agreements work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached a contract covering approximately 7000 traditional wireline employees in our midwest region expired in april 2018 in august 2019 a new fouryear contract was ratified by employees and will expire in april 2022 a contract covering approximately 3000 traditional wireline employees in our legacy att corp business expired in april 2018 in august 2019 a new fouryear contract was ratified by employees and will expire in april 2022 a contract covering approximately 18000 traditional wireline employees in our southeast region expired in august 2019 in october 2019 a new fiveyear contract was ratified by employees and will expire in august 2024 other contracts covering approximately 20000 employees are scheduled to expire during 2020 including a contract expiring in february covering approximately 7000 mobility employees and a contract expiring in april covering approximately 13000 traditional wireline employees in our west region

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the other information set forth in this document including the matters contained under the caption “cautionary language concerning forwardlooking statements” you should carefully read the matters described below we believe that each of these matters could materially affect our business we recognize that most of these factors are beyond our ability to control and therefore we cannot predict an outcome 

  

macroeconomic factors 

  

adverse changes in medical costs the us securities markets and interest rates could materially increase our benefit plan costs 

  

our costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases primarily due to continuing increases in medical and prescription drug costs and can be affected by lower returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plans which are reflected in our financial statements for that year favorable market returns in 2019 have led to higher than assumed investment returns on our plan assets with a lower endofperiod yield curve contributing to higher benefit obligations resulting in an insignificant change to our overall funding obligations should favorable market returns continue we may need to adjust our assumed rate of return on plan assets in calculating the costs included on our financial statements of providing benefits under our plans we have made certain assumptions regarding future investment returns medical costs and interest rates while we have made some changes to the benefit plans to limit our risk from increasing medical costs if actual investment returns medical costs and interest rates are worse than those previously assumed our expenses will increase 

  

the financial accounting standards board requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in our statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur we have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income therefore an increase in our costs or adverse market conditions will have a negative effect on our operating results 

  

adverse changes in global financial markets could limit our ability and our larger customers’ ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operations 

  

during 2019 volatility in the credit currency equity and fixed income markets persisted due to continued uncertainty surrounding global growth rates uncertainty regarding ongoing us tariffs on chinese goods and vice versa the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union and other political developments in europe and asia could significantly affect global financial markets in 2020 volatility in other areas such as in emerging markets may affect companies’ access to the credit markets leading to higher borrowing costs or in some cases the inability to fund ongoing operations in addition we contract with large financial institutions to support our own treasury operations including contracts to hedge our exposure on interest rates and foreign exchange and the funding of credit lines and other shortterm debt obligations including commercial paper these financial institutions face stricter capitalrelated and other regulations in the united states and europe as well as ongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loan portfolios which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit 

  

the interest rate used to calculate the rate of variable rate indebtedness the libor benchmark will not be reported after 2021 although our securities may provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may adversely affect the current trading market for liborbased securities and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general a company’s cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects while we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions severely affecting our business operations 

  

our international operations have increased our exposure to political instability to changes in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risks could offset our expected growth opportunities 

  

   

we have international operations particularly latin america including mexico and worldwide through warnermedia’s content distribution as well as services to our large usbased businesses we need to comply with a wide variety of complex local laws regulations and treaties we are exposed to restrictions on cash repatriation foreign exchange controls fluctuations in currency values changes in relationships between us and foreign governments trade restrictions including potential tariffs differences in intellectual property protection laws and other regulations that may affect materially our earnings our mexico operations in particular rely on a continuation of a regulatory regime that fosters competition while our foreign operations represent significant opportunities to sell our services a number of foreign countries where we operate have experienced unstable growth patterns high inflation currency devaluation foreign exchange controls instability in the banking sector and high unemployment in addition several latin america countries have experienced significant political turmoil during 2019 should these conditions persist our ability to offer service in one or more countries could be adversely affected and customers in these countries may be unable to purchase the services we offer or pay for services already provided 

  

in addition operating in foreign countries also typically involves participating with local businesses either to comply with local laws or for example to enhance product marketing deploy networks or execute on other capital projects involvement with foreign firms exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the actions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa violations of the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

industrywide factors 

  

changes to federal state and foreign government regulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings could further increase our operating costs andor alter customer perceptions of our operations which could materially adversely affect us 

  

our subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitors are not in addition our subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside the united states are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided our wireless and various video subsidiaries are regulated to varying degrees by the fcc and in some instances by state and local agencies adverse regulations and rulings by the fcc relating to broadband wireless deployment and satellite video issues could impede our ability to manage our networks and recover costs and lessen incentives to invest in our networks the continuing growth of ipbased services especially when accessed by wireless devices has created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcomes unfavorable to us in addition increased public focus on a variety of issues related to our operations such as privacy issues government requests or orders for customer data and concerns about global climate changes have led to proposals or new legislation at state federal and foreign government levels to change or increase regulation on our operations enactment of new privacy laws and regulations could among other things adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisements an expected growth area for the company or result in additional costs of compliance or litigation should customers decide that our competitors offer a more customerfriendly environment our competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

continuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless video and broadband services will require us to deploy significant amounts of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive services to customers 

  

wireless video and broadband services are undergoing rapid and significant technological changes and a dramatic increase in usage in particular the demand for faster and seamless usage of video and data across mobile and fixed devices we must continually invest in our networks in order to improve our wireless video and broadband services to meet this increasing demand and remain competitive improvements in these services depend on many factors including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these services in order to stem broadband subscriber losses to cable competitors in our nonfiber wireline areas we have been expanding our allfiber wireline network we must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of video data and voice between cell and fixed landline sites to this end we have participated in spectrum auctions and continue to deploy software and other technology advancements in order to efficiently invest in our network 

  

network service enhancements and product launches may not occur as scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors including delays in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standards supplier delays software issues 

   

increases in network and handset component costs regulatory permitting delays for tower sites or enhancements or laborrelated delays deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing services if we cannot acquire needed spectrum or deploy the services customers desire on a timely basis with acceptable quality and at adequate cost then our ability to attract and retain customers and therefore maintain and improve our operating margins could be materially adversely affected 

  

increasing competition for wireless customers could materially adversely affect our operating results 

  

we have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas and compete for customers based principally on servicedevice offerings price network quality coverage area and customer service in addition we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using advanced wireless technologies and ipbased networks we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry’s customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates leading to increased competition for customers we also expect that our customers’ growing demand for highspeed video and data services will place constraints on our network capacity these competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers our ability to respond will depend among other things on continued improvement in network quality and customer service as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services these efforts will involve significant expenses and require strategic management decisions on and timely implementation of equipment choices network deployment and service offerings 

  

ongoing changes in the television industry and consumer viewing patterns could materially adversely affect our operating results 

  

our video subsidiaries derive substantial revenues and profits from cable networks and premium pay television services and the production and licensing of television programming to broadcast and cable networks and premium pay television services the us television industry is continuing to evolve rapidly with developments in technology leading to new methods for the distribution of video content and changes in when where and how audiences consume video content these changes have led to 1 new internetbased ott competitors which are increasing in number and some of which have significant and growing subscriberuser bases and 2 reduced viewers of traditional advertisingsupported television resulting from increased video consumption through svod services timeshifted viewing of television programming and the use of dvrs to skip advertisements the number of subscribers to traditional linear programming in the us has been declining in recent years and the us television industry has generally experienced declines in ratings for programming which have negatively affected subscription and advertising revenues and these trends are expected to continue the popularity of content whether on television on the internet or through movies is difficult to predict and can change rapidly and low public acceptance of our television ott and movie content including warnermedia’s content could adversely affect our results of operations we are taking steps to mitigate the risks from these changes such as our 2020 launch of our hbo max directtoconsumer streaming platform and new enhanced advertising opportunities but there can be no assurance that these and other efforts will be successful in responding to these changes 

  

intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by piracy or be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunities such as new distribution platforms which may materially adversely affect our operations 

  

increased piracy of video content products and other intellectual property particularly in our foreign warnermedia and latin american operations will decrease revenues mobile and broadband technological developments have made it easier to reproduce and distribute highquality unauthorized copies of content piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and other legal protections or enforcement measures and thieves can attract users throughout the world effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate we may need to spend significant amounts of money to protect our rights we are also increasingly negotiating broader licensing agreements to expand our ability to use new methods to distribute content to customers any impairment of our intellectual property rights including due to changes in us or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures or our inability to negotiate broader distribution rights could materially adversely impact our operations 

  

companyspecific financial factors 

  

adoption of new softwarebased technologies may involve quality and supply chain issues and could increase capital costs 

  

   

the communications and digital entertainment industry has experienced rapid changes in the past several years an increasing number of our customers are using mobile devices as the primary means of viewing video and an increasing number of nontraditional video providers are developing content and technologies to satisfy the desire for video entertainment demand in addition businesses and government bodies are broadly shifting to wirelessbased services for homes and infrastructure to improve services to their respective customers and constituencies in order to meet this demand and remain competitive we now offer a mobile tv service and continue to upgrade our sophisticated wired and wireless networks including satellites as well as research other technologies we are spending significant capital to shift our wired network to softwarebased technology to manage this demand and are launching 5g wireless technology to address these consumer demands we are entering into a significant number of software licensing agreements and working with software developers to provide network functions in lieu of installing switches or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid developments in video and wireless demand while softwarebased functionality can be changed much more quickly than for example physical switches the rapid pace of development means that we may increasingly need to rely on singlesource and software solutions that have not previously been deployed in production environments should this software not function as intended or our license agreements provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claims we could be forced to either substitute if available or else spend time to develop alternative technologies at a much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability and as a result our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected 

  

increasing costs to provide video and other services could adversely affect operating margins 

  

our operating costs including customer acquisition and retention costs could continue to put pressure on margins and customer retention levels in addition most of our video programming that we distribute via our linear services is provided by other companies and historically the rates they charge us for programming have often increased more than the rate of inflation in addition as customer viewing habits shift to mobile and ondemand from linear programming negotiating licensing rights is increasingly complicated we are attempting to use our increased scale and access to wireless customers to change this trend but such negotiations are difficult and also may result in programming disruption our new hbo max streaming platform is another component of our strategy to reach nontraditional video customers and we are investing heavily to launch a competitive and attractive offering if we are unable to restrain these costs or provide programming desired by our customers it could impact margins and our ability to attract and retain customers our warnermedia operations which create and license content to other providers also may experience increasing difficulties to secure favorable terms including those related to pricing positioning and packaging during contract negotiations which may lead to blackouts of warnermedia programming and warnermedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks and premium pay television services in smaller bundles or mobile offerings by third parties 

  

a number of our competitors offering comparable legacy services that rely on alternative technologies and business models are typically subject to less or no regulation and therefore are able to operate with lower costs these competitors generally can focus on discrete customer segments since they do not have regulatory obligations to provide universal service also these competitors have cost advantages compared to us due in part to operating on newer more technically advanced and lowercost networks and a nonunionized workforce lower employee benefits and fewer retirees we have begun initiatives at both the state and federal levels to obtain regulatory approvals where needed to transition services from our older copperbased network to an advanced ipbased network if we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our network transition or obtain approvals with onerous conditions we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantages 

  

if our efforts to attract and retain subscribers to our new hbo max platform are not successful our business will be adversely affected 

  

as with any new product launch hbo max’s future success is subject to inherent uncertainty our ability to attract subscribers to the hbo max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscribers with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choices furthermore the relative service levels content offerings promotions and pricing and related features of competitors to hbo max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers competitors include other entertainment video providers such as multichannel video programming distributors and internetbased movie and tv content providers if consumers do not perceive our offerings to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or offerings terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings experience technical issues or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers in addition many subscribers to these types of offerings originate from wordofmouth advertising from then existing subscribers if our efforts to satisfy subscribers are not successful including because we terminate or modify promotional or trialperiod offerings or 

   

because of technical issues with the platform we may not be able to attract subscribers and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected 

  

if subscribers cancel or decide to not continue subscriptions for many reasons including a perception that they do not use it sufficiently the need to cut household expenses unsatisfactory availability of content promotions or trialperiod offers expire or are modified competitive services or promotions provide a better value or experience and customer service or technical issues are not satisfactorily resolved our business will be adversely affected we must continually add new subscribers both to replace canceled subscribers and to grow our business if we do not grow as expected given in particular that a significant portion of our content costs are committed and contracted over several years based on minimum subscriber delivery levels we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per subscriber revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in retaining and attracting new subscribers our business will be adversely affected further if excessive numbers of subscribers do cancel we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures or offer significantly more generous promotions to replace these subscribers with new subscribers 

  

unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures 

  

we are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the united states and in foreign countries including at any particular time claims relating to antitrust patent infringement wage and hour personal injury customer privacy violations regulatory proceedings and selling and collection practices we also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards which may entail related investigations and litigation in the wireless area we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effects on customers or employees who use such technologies including for example wireless devices we may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our operations or financial results 

  

cyberattacks equipment failures natural disasters and terrorist acts may materially adversely affect our operations 

  

cyberattacks major equipment failures or natural disasters such as flooding hurricanes and forest fires whether caused by discrete severe weather events andor precipitated by longterm climate change and earthquakes software problems terrorist acts or other breaches of network or it security that affect our networks including software and switches microwave links thirdpartyowned local and longdistance networks on which we rely our cell sites or other equipment our satellites our customer account support and information systems or employee and business records could have a material adverse effect on our operations our wired network in particular is becoming increasingly reliant on software as it evolves to handle increasing demands for video transmission while we have been subject to security incidents or cyberattacks these did not result in a material adverse effect on our operations however as such attacks continue to increase in scope and frequency we may be unable to prevent a significant attack in the future our ability to maintain and upgrade our video programming also depends on our ability to successfully deploy and operate video satellites our inability to deploy or operate our networks or customer support systems or protect sensitive personal information of customers or valuable technical and marketing information could result in significant expenses potential legal liability a loss of current or future customers and reputation damage any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

  

increases in our debt levels to fund acquisitions additional spectrum purchases or other strategic decisions could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rates and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trends 

  

we have incurred debt to fund significant acquisitions as well as spectrum purchases needed to compete in our industry while we believe such decisions were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunities and respond to industry developments we did experience creditrating downgrades from historical levels banks and potential purchasers of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decisions and similar actions we may take in the future as well as expected trends in the industry will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand a higher rate of interest impose restrictive covenants or otherwise limit the amount of potential borrowing additionally our capital allocation plan is focused on among other things further reducing our debt going forward any failure to successfully execute this plan could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets

we have four reportable segments 1 communications 2 warnermedia 3 latin america and 4 xandr our segment results presented in note 4 and discussed below follow our internal management reporting we analyze our segments based on segment operating contribution which consists of operating income excluding acquisitionrelated costs and other significant items and equity in net income loss of affiliates for investments managed within each segment each segment’s percentage calculation of total segment operating revenue and contribution is derived from our segment results table in note 4 and may total more than 100 due to losses in one or more segments percentage increases and decreases that are not considered meaningful are denoted with a dash we have recast our segment results for all prior periods presented to exclude wireless and wireline operations in puerto rico and the us virgin islands from our mobility and business wireline business units of the communications segment instead reporting them with corporate and other see note 6 

  

   

the communications segment accounted for approximately 77 of our 2019 total segment operating revenues compared to 84 in 2018 and 76 of our 2019 total segment operating contribution as compared to 84 in 2018 this segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the us and businesses globally our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets this segment contains the following business units

 mexico provides wireless service and equipment to customers in mexico 

 vrio provides video services primarily to residential customers using satellite technology in latin america and the caribbean 

  

the xandr segment accounted for approximately 1 of our total segment operating revenues in 2019 and 2018 and 3 of our total segment operating contribution in 2019 and 2018 this segment provides advertising services these services utilize data insights to develop and deliver targeted advertising across video and digital platforms 

  

results of operations 

  

consolidated results our financial results are summarized in the following table we then discuss factors affecting our overall results for the past three years additional analysis is discussed in our “segment results” section we also discuss our expected revenue and expense trends for 2020 in the “operating environment and trends of the business” section certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation 

  

   

overview 

  

   

operating revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to including a full year’s worth of time warner results which was acquired in june 2018 partially offsetting the increase were declines in the communications segment driven by continued pressure in legacy and video services and lower wireless equipment upgrades that were offset by growth in advanced data and wireless services 

  

operations and support expenses increased in 2019 primarily due to our 2018 acquisition of time warner and the abandonment of certain copper assets that will not be necessary to support future network activity see note 7 the increase was partially offset by lower costs in our communications segment specifically fewer subscribers contributing to lower content costs lower upgrades driving a decline in wireless equipment costs and our continued focus on cost management 

  

depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2019 

amortization expense decreased 415 or 50 in 2019 primarily due to the amortization of intangibles associated with warnermedia we expect continued declines in amortization expense reflecting the accelerated method of amortization applied to certain of the warnermedia intangibles 

  

depreciation expense increased 202 or 10 in 2019 primarily due to the time warner acquisition 

  

operating income increased in 2019 and 2018 our operating margin was 154 in 2019 compared to 153 in 2018 and 124 in 2017 

  

interest expense increased in 2019 primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with putting spectrum into network service 

  

equity in net income loss of affiliates increased in 2019 primarily due to the sale of hulu which had losses of 44 in 2019 and 105 in 2018 see note 6 

  

other income expense – net decreased in 2019 primarily due to the recognition of 5171 in actuarial losses compared to gains of 3412 in 2018 also contributing to the decline were higher debt redemption costs partially offset by increased income from rabbi trusts and other investments and gains from the sales of nonstrategic assets 

  

income tax expense decreased in 2019 primarily driven by a decrease in income before income taxes our effective tax rate was 189 in 2019 198 in 2018 and 972 in 2017 all years were impacted by the tax cuts and jobs act which was enacted in 2017 

  

segment results our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms andor in different geographies that are managed accordingly our segment results presented below follow our internal management reporting in addition to segment operating contribution we also evaluate segment performance based on ebitda andor ebitda margin ebitda is defined as segment operating contribution excluding equity in net income loss of affiliates and depreciation and amortization we believe ebitda to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate operating performance ebitda does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions reinvestment or other discretionary uses ebitda margin is ebitda divided by total revenues 

  

   

   

   

operating revenues decreased in 2019 driven by declines in our entertainment group and business wireline business units partially offset by increases in our mobility business unit the decrease reflects the continued shift away from legacy voice and data products and linear video largely offset by higher wireless service revenues from growth in postpaid phone subscribers and average revenue per subscriber arpu and growth in our prepaid subscriber base 

  

operating contribution increased in 2019 and 2018 the 2019 contribution includes improvements in our mobility and entertainment group business units partially offset by declines in our business wireline business unit our communications segment operating income margin was 226 in 2019 223 in 2018 and 211 in 2017 

  

   

   

   

   

service revenue increased during 2019 largely due to prepaid subscriber gains and higher postpaid phone arpu driven by the adoption of unlimited plans 

  

arpu 

arpu increased primarily due to pricing actions that were not in effect in the prior year and a continued shift by subscribers to our unlimited plans 

  

churn 

   

the effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins competitive pricing in the industry contributed to higher postpaid churn rates in 2019 and our move to unlimited plans combined with an improved customer experience in 2018 contributed to lower churn rates in that year 

  

equipment revenue decreased in 2019 the 2019 decrease was driven by lower postpaid sales resulting from the continuing trend of customers choosing to upgrade devices less frequently or bring their own which is generally offset by lower equipment expense  

  

operations and support expenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower equipment expense driven by low upgrade rates and increased operational efficiencies partially offset by higher bad debt expense and handset insurance costs 

  

depreciation expenses decreased in 2019 primarily due to fully depreciated assets partially offset by ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion 

  

operating income increased in 2019 and 2018 our mobility operating income margin was 314 in 2019 306 in 2018 and 285 in 2017 our mobility ebitda margin was 427 in 2019 423 in 2018 and 398 in 2017 

  

subscriber relationships 

as the wireless industry has matured we believe future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services plans and devices that take advantage of our premier 5g wireless network and to provide these services in bundled product offerings subscribers that purchase two or more services from us have significantly lower churn than subscribers that purchase only one service to support higher mobile data usage our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible 

  

to attract and retain subscribers in a mature and highly competitive market we have launched a wide variety of plans including our firstnet and prepaid products and arrangements that bundle our video services virtually all of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are on plans that provide for service on multiple devices at reduced rates and such subscribers tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates such offerings are intended to encourage existing subscribers to upgrade their current services andor add devices attract subscribers from other providers andor minimize subscriber churn  we also offer unlimited data plans and such subscribers also tend to have higher retention and lower churn rates 

  

connected devices 

connected devices include datacentric devices such as wholesale automobile systems monitoring devices fleet management and sessionbased tablets connected device subscribers increased in 2019 and we added approximately 84 million wholesale connected cars through agreements with various carmakers and experienced strong growth in other internet of things iot connections as well we believe that these connected car agreements give us the opportunity to create future retail relationships with the car owners 

  

   

   

   

   

   

video entertainment revenues are comprised of subscription and advertising revenues revenues decreased in 2019 largely driven by a 150 decline in premium tv subscribers as we continue to focus on highvalue customers partially offset by subscriptionbased advertising growth of 48 our customers continue to shift consistent with the rest of the industry from a premium linear service to our more economically priced ott video service or to competitors which has pressured our video revenues 

  

revenue declines in our premium tv products were partially offset by growth in revenues from our ott service att tv now which were primarily attributable to pricing actions att tv now subscriber net additions declined in 2019 due to price increases and fewer promotions 

  

highspeed internet revenues increased in 2019 reflecting higher arpu resulting from the continued shift of subscribers to our higherspeed fiber services our bundling strategy is helping to lower churn with subscribers who bundle broadband with another att service 

  

legacy voice and data service revenues decreased in 2019 reflecting the continued migration of customers to our more advanced ipbased offerings or to competitors the trend at which we are experiencing these revenue declines has slowed with a decrease of 468 in 2019 compared to 726 in 2018 

  

operations and support expenses decreased in 2019 largely driven by lower content costs from fewer subscribers and our ongoing focus on cost initiatives partially offsetting the decreases were higher amortization of fulfillment cost deferrals including the impact of secondquarter updates to decrease the estimated economic life for our entertainment group customers and costs associated with nfl sunday ticket we expect the secondquarter 2019 update to estimated economic customer lives and our launch of att tv our new streaming premium tv product to contribute to expense pressure in the first half of 2020 

  

depreciation expenses decreased in 2019 due to network assets becoming fully depreciated partially offsetting the decreases was ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion including the completion of the fiber commitment under the directv acquisition 

  

operating income increased in 2019 and decreased in 2018 our entertainment group operating income margin was 107 in 2019 101 in 2018 and 109 in 2017 our entertainment group ebitda margin was 224 in 2019 216 in 2018 and 222 in 2017 

  

   

   

strategic and managed services revenues increased in 2019 our strategic services are made up of 1 data services including our vpn dedicated internet ethernet and broadband 2 voice service including voip and cloudbased voice solutions 3 security and cloud solutions and 4 managed professional and outsourcing services revenue increases were primarily attributable to our data services and security and cloud solutions 

  

legacy voice and data service revenues decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower demand as customers continue to shift to our more advanced ipbased offerings or our competitors the trend at which we are experiencing these revenue declines has slowed with a decrease of 1494 in 2019 compared to 3117 in 2018 

  

other service and equipment revenues increased in 2019 driven by higher intellectual property licensing activity revenues from the licensing of intellectual property assets vary from periodtoperiod and can impact revenue trends other service revenues include projectbased revenue which is nonrecurring in nature as well as revenues from customer premises equipment 

  

operations and support expenses decreased in 2019 the 2019 decrease was primarily due to our continued efforts to shift to a softwarebased network and automate and digitize our customer support activities partially offset by higher fulfillment deferral amortization 

  

depreciation expense increased in 2019 primarily due to increases in capital spending for network upgrades and expansion  

  

operating income decreased in 2019 and 2018 our business wireline operating income margin was 194 in 2019 218 in 2018 and 206 in 2017 our business wireline ebitda margin was 385 in 2019 394 in 2018 and 369 in 2017 

  

   

   

our warnermedia segment consists of our turner home box office and warner bros business units the order of presentation reflects the consistency of revenue streams rather than overall magnitude as that is subject to timing and frequency of studio releases warnermedia also includes our financial results for regional sports networks rsns 

  

the warnermedia segment does not include results from time warner operations for the periods prior to our june 14 2018 acquisition otter media is included as an equity method investment for periods prior to our august 7 2018 acquisition of the remaining interest and is in the segment operating results following the acquisition consistent with our past practice many of the impacts of the fair value adjustments from the application of purchase accounting required under gaap have not been allocated to the segment instead they are reported as acquisitionrelated items in the reconciliation to consolidated results 

  

due to the june 2018 acquisition of time warner segment and business unit results for 2019 are not comparable to prior periods and therefore comparative results are not discussed 

  

   

turner includes the warnermedia businesses managed by turner as well as our financial results for rsns 

  

   

operating revenues are generated primarily from licensing programming to distribution affiliates and from selling advertising on its networks and digital properties we expect strong advertising revenue growth in 2020 as turner advertising revenues are expected to benefit from presidential election political spend and from airing the ncaa final four and championship games 

  

operating income increased in 2019 our turner operating income margin was 392 for 2019 and 438 for 2018 our turner ebitda margin was 410 for 2019 and 456 for 2018 

  

   

operating revenues are generated from the exploitation of original and licensed programming through distribution outlets 

  

operating income increased in 2019 our home box office operating income margin was 346 for 2019 and 377 for 2018 our home box office ebitda margin was 361 for 2019 and 392 for 2018 

  

   

operating revenues primarily relate to theatrical product which is content made available for initial exhibition in theaters and television product which is content made available for initial airing on television or ott services during 2019 fourthquarter revenues were pressured from foregone content licensing revenues as we prepare for our launch of hbo max in 2020 and lower theatrical product resulting from a more favorable mix of box office and home entertainment releases in the prior year the timing of theatrical releases varies from year to year and is based on several factors the variability of the release 

   

schedule and the difficulty in predicting the popularity of content can result in meaningfulmaterial changes in quarterly revenue results as well as difficult yearoveryear comparisons 

  

operating income increased in 2019 our warner bros operating income margin was 166 for 2019 and 170 for 2018 our warner bros ebitda margin was 177 for 2019 and 181 for 2018 

  

   

operating results 

our latin america operations conduct business in their local currency and operating results are converted to us dollars using official exchange rates subjecting results to foreign currency fluctuations 

  

operating revenues decreased in 2019 driven by lower revenues for vrio primarily resulting from foreign exchange pressure related to argentina’s hyperinflationary economy mexico revenues were stable with service revenue growth offset by lower equipment sales 

  

operating contribution increased in 2019 and decreased in 2018 reflecting foreign exchange pressure offset by improvement in mexico our latin america segment operating income margin was 95 in 2019 97 in 2018 and 43 in 2017

operating environment and trends of the business 

2020 revenue trends we expect revenue growth in our wireless and broadband businesses as customers demand premium content instant connectivity and higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements through 5g deployment in our communications segment we expect that our network quality and first responder network authority firstnet deployment will contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that 5g handset introductions during 2020 will drive wireless equipment revenue growth we anticipate that applications like video streaming will also drive greater demand for broadband in our warnermedia segment we expect our premium content 

   

to drive revenue growth from both the current wholesale distribution through traditional paytv providers and our new video streaming platform hbo max to be launched in may 2020 across att we expect to provide consumers with a broad variety of video entertainment services from mobilecentric and ott livetv streaming packages to traditional fullsize linear video we expect growth in our advertising businesses from combining the data insights from our 170 million directtoconsumer relationships with our premium video and digital advertising inventory revenue from business customers will continue to grow for mobile and ipbased services but decline for legacy wireline services overall we believe growth in wireless broadband and warnermedia’s premium content should offset pressure from our linear video and legacy voice and data services 

  

2020 expense trends we expect the spending required to support growth initiatives primarily our 5g deployment and firstnet build as well as the launch of the hbo max platform to pressure expense trends in 2020 to the extent 5g handset introductions in 2020 are as expected the expenses associated with those device sales will also contribute to higher costs in addition we expect the secondquarter 2019 update to estimated economic customer lives and our launch of att tv our new streaming premium tv product to contribute to expense pressure in the first half of the year during 2020 we will also continue to transition our hardwarebased network technology to more efficient and less expensive softwarebased technology these investments will prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services including video streaming augmented reality and “smart” technologies the software benefits of our 5g wireless technology and new video delivery platforms should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower networkrelated expenses in the coming years 

  

to offset the costs of these initiatives we anticipate savings from corporate initiatives to lower laborrelated costs and corporate overhead digital transformation of customer service and ordering functions vendor discounts and warnermedia merger synergies cost savings and nonstrategic asset sales should help to further reduce our debt level 

  

market conditions the us stock market experienced a positive year although general business investment remained modest which affected our business services most of our products and services are not directly affected by the imposition of tariffs on chinese goods to date we have not experienced any disruptions from our wireless handset supply chain due to the coronavirus epidemic in china but we continue to monitor the situation while unemployment remains historically low our residential customers continue to be price sensitive in selecting offerings especially in the video area and continue to focus on products that give them efficient access to video and broadcast services we expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2020 as we respond to the competitive marketplace especially in wireless and video services 

  

included on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa we expect only minimal erisa contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2020 investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy and a weakness in the equity fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans in addition our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions however these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in other income expense – net changes in our discount rate which are tied to changes in the bond market and changes in the performance of equity markets may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2020 see “critical accounting policies and estimates” 

  

operating environment overview 

  

att subsidiaries operating within the united states are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities att subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the markets where service is provided 

  

in the telecommunications act of 1996 telecom act congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare nonetheless over the ensuing two decades the federal communications commission fcc and some state regulatory commissions have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies more recently the fcc has pursued a more deregulatory agenda eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas in addition we are pursuing at both the state and federal levels additional legislative and regulatory 

   

measures to reduce regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive telecommunications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all ipbased networks at the same time we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services which are subject to vigorous competition 

  

we have organized the following discussion by reportable segment 

  

communications segment 

internet the fcc currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services subject to lighttouch regulation although the dc circuit upheld the fcc’s current classification challenges to that decision remain pending a more detailed discussion can be found under “regulatory developments” 

  

a number of states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the fcc and in some cases established additional requirements suits have been filed concerning laws in certain states but have been stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet a more detailed discussion can be found under “regulatory developments” 

  

in october 2016 the fcc adopted new rules governing the use of customer information by providers of broadband internet access service those rules were more restrictive in certain respects than those governing other participants in the internet economy including socalled “edge” providers such as google and facebook in april 2017 the president signed a resolution passed by congress repealing the new rules under the congressional review act 

  

privacyrelated legislation has been considered or adopted in a number of states legislative and regulatory action could result in increased costs of compliance claims against broadband internet access service providers and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data effective as of january 1 2020 a california state law gives consumers the right to know what personal information is being collected about them and whether and to whom it is sold or disclosed and to access and request deletion of this information subject to certain exceptions it also gives california consumers the right to opt out of the sale of personal information 

  

wireless the industrywide deployment of 5g technology which is needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access will involve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment and therefore increase the need for local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment on reasonable timelines and terms federal regulations also can delay and impede the deployment of infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services including small cell equipment in march august and september 2018 the fcc adopted orders to streamline federal and local wireless infrastructure review processes in order to facilitate deployment of nextgeneration wireless facilities specifically the fcc’s march 2018 order streamlined historical tribal and environmental review requirements for wireless infrastructure including by excluding most small cell facilities from such review the order was appealed and in august 2019 the dc circuit court of appeals vacated the fcc’s finding that most small cell facilities are excluded from review but otherwise upheld the fcc’s order the fcc’s august and september 2018 orders simplified the regulations for attaching telecommunications equipment to utility poles and clarified when local government rightofway access and use restrictions can be preempted because they unlawfully prohibit the provision of telecommunications services those orders were appealed to the 9th circuit court of appeals where they remain pending in addition to the fcc’s actions to date 28 states and puerto rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment 

  

in december 2018 we introduced the nation’s first commercial mobile 5g service we expect to have mobile 5g service available nationwide to more than 200 million people by the second quarter of 2020 we anticipate the introduction of 5g handsets and devices will contribute to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades 

  

as the us wireless industry has matured we believe future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services plans and devices and to provide these services in bundled product offerings to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geographic basis as possible we continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity as well as to secure and utilize spectrum that meets our longterm needs we secured the firstnet contract which provides us with access to 20 mhz of nationwide low band spectrum and invested in 5g and millimeterwave technologies with our acquisition of fibertower corporation which holds significant amounts of spectrum in the millimeter wave bands 39 ghz that the fcc reallocated for mobile broadband 

   

services we were also awarded 24 ghz licenses covering a nationwide footprint in a recent fcc auction these bands will help to accelerate our entry into 5g services 

  

video we provide domestic satellite video service through our subsidiary directv whose satellites are licensed by the fcc the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of directv and some of warnermedia’s businesses are also subject to obligations under the communications act and related fcc regulations 

  

warnermedia segment 

we create own and distribute intellectual property including copyrights trademarks and licenses of intellectual property to protect our intellectual property we rely on a combination of laws and license agreements outside of the us laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country the european union commission is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives that could impair warner bros’ current countrybycountry licensing approach in the european union piracy particularly of digital content continues to threaten warnermedia’s revenues from products and services and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including technological and legislative solutions outside the us various laws and regulations as well as trade agreements with the us also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in movie theaters and on broadcast and cable networks for example in certain countries including china laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year 

  

expected growth areas 

  

over the next few years we expect our growth to come from wireless softwarebased video offerings like hbo max ipbased broadband services and advertising and data insights especially with warnermedia we now provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the us on an integrated telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms including wireless satellite and wireline in 2020 our key initiatives include 

 launching 5g service nationwide on our premier wireless network 

 generating mobile subscriber growth from firstnet and our premier network quality 

 launching hbo max our new platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers as well as through our traditional distributors 

 increasing fiber penetration and growing broadband revenues 

 continuing to develop a competitive advantage through our industryleading network cost structure 

 growing profitability in our mexico business unit 

  

wireless we expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years we are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for nextgeneration converged services that combine technologies and services we secured the firstnet contract which provides us with access to 20 mhz of nationwide low band spectrum and the opportunity to grow subscribers through the first responder agencies served and invested in 5g and millimeterwave technologies with our acquisition of fibertower corporation which holds significant amounts of spectrum in the millimeter wave bands 39 ghz that the fcc reallocated for mobile broadband services these bands will help to accelerate our entry into 5g services 

  

as of december 31 2019 we served 185 million wireless subscribers in north america with 166 million in the united states our lte technology covers over 430 million people in north america and in the united states we cover all major metropolitan areas and more than 330 million people we also provide 4g coverage using another technology hspa and when combined with our upgraded backhaul network we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services in december 2018 we introduced the nation’s first commercial mobile 5g service and plan to expand that deployment nationwide by the second quarter of 2020 to cover approximately 200 million people 

  

our networks covering both the us and mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies’ networks we believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity as of the end of 2019 we provided lte coverage to approximately 100 million people in mexico 

  

integration of databroadband and entertainment services as the communications industry has evolved into internetbased technologies capable of blending wireline satellite and wireless services we plan to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and provide highspeed internet and video offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or 

   

business fixed services with their mobile service during 2020 we will continue to develop and provide unique integrated video mobile and broadband solutions the launch of the hbo max platform will facilitate our customers’ desire to view video anywhere on demand and encourage customer retention 

  

regulatory developments 

  

set forth below is a summary of the most significant regulatory proceedings that directly affected our operations during 2019 industrywide regulatory developments are discussed above in operating environment overview while these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries the words “we” “att” and “our” are used to simplify the discussion the following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues 

  

international regulation our subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate our licensing compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise ie large business wireless and satellite television services att is engaged in multiple efforts with foreign regulators to open markets to competition foster conditions favorable to investment and increase our scope of services and products 

  

the general data protection regulation went into effect in europe in may of 2018 att processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers employees of its enterprise customers and its employees this regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance 

  

federal regulation we have organized our following discussion by service impacted 

  

internet in february 2015 the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to title ii of the communications act the order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fcc’s authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements in december 2017 the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization several parties appealed the fcc’s december 2017 decision and the dc circuit heard oral argument on the appeals on february 1 2019 on october 1 2019 the court issued a unanimous opinion upholding the fcc’s reclassification of broadband as an information service and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality while the court vacated the fcc’s express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality it nevertheless stressed that its ruling does not prevent the fcc or isps from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the fcc’s regulatory objectives and framework the court also concluded that the fcc failed to satisfy its obligation under the administrative procedure act apa to consider the impact of its 2017 order in three discrete areas public safety the lifeline program and pole attachment regulation and thus remanded it to the fcc for further proceedings on those issues but without disturbing the operative effect of that order several petitions for rehearing of the dc circuit’s october 1 decision have been filed those petitions remain pending a number of states have adopted legislation to reimpose the very rules the fcc repealed in some cases state legislation imposes requirements that go beyond the fcc’s february 2015 order additionally some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements suits have been filed concerning laws in california and vermont both lawsuits have been stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals of the fcc’s december 2017 order we expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet 

  

wireless and broadband since november 2017 the fcc has adopted four significant rulings designed to accelerate broadband infrastructure deployment in november 2017 the fcc updated and streamlined certain rules governing pole attachments copper retirement and service discontinuances in march 2018 the fcc eliminated lengthy environmental historical and tribal reviews for most small cell deployments and streamlined processes that must be followed when those reviews are required the dc circuit court of appeals vacated the fcc’s finding in this order that small cell facilities do not require environmental historical and tribal reviews but left intact all other processes adopted to streamline review when required in august 2018 the fcc adopted more comprehensive pole attachment reform including by simplifying the attaching process ie onetouch makeready and clarified that the communications act precludes local governments from imposing moratoria on the deployment of communications facilities and in september 2018 the fcc restricted the ability 

   

of state and local governments to impede small cell deployments in rightsofway and on governmentowned structures through exorbitant fees unreasonable aesthetic requirements and other actions these decisions will remove regulatory barriers and reduce the costs of the infrastructure needed for 5g deployment which will enhance our ability to place small cell facilities on utility poles and to replace legacy facilities and services with advanced broadband infrastructure and services appeals of the august and september 2018 orders remain pending in the 9th circuit court of appeals 

  

in 2018 the fcc took several actions to make spectrum available for 5g services in late 2018 the fcc adopted auction rules for the 39 ghz band that will allow the fcc to auction remaining unlicensed 39 ghz spectrum and realign the band to allow large contiguous blocks of spectrum that will support 5g this auction which also includes spectrum in the 37 ghz and 47 ghz bands is currently underway the fcc has granted att special temporary authority to launch its 5g service in 400 mhz of contiguous spectrum in the 3739 ghz band in a total of 32 markets in addition the fcc completed auctions in 2019 of 24 and 28 ghz spectrum two other bands that will support 5g att was awarded 24 ghz licenses covering a nationwide footprint 

  

accounting policies and standards 

critical accounting policies and estimates because of the size of the financial statement line items they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others the following policies are presented in the order in which the topics appear in our consolidated statements of income 

  

pension and postretirement benefits our actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weightedaverage assumptions are discussed in note 15 our assumed weightedaverage discount rates for pension and postretirement benefits of 340 and 320 respectively at december 31 2019 reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants we determined our discount rate based on a range of factors including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred highquality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations these bonds were all rated at least aa3 or aa by one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations denominated in us dollars and neither callable convertible nor index linked for the year ended december 31 2019 when compared to the year ended december 31 2018 we decreased our pension discount rate by 110 resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of 8018 and decreased our postretirement discount rate by 120 resulting in an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of 2399 

  

our expected longterm rate of return on pension plan assets is 700 for 2020 and 2019 our expected longterm rate of return on postretirement plan assets is 475 for 2020 and 575 for 2019 our expected return on plan assets is calculated using the actual fair value of plan assets if all other factors were to remain unchanged we expect that a 050 decrease in the expected longterm rate of return would cause 2020 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase 273 which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns in the current year as part of our fourthquarter remeasurement of our retiree benefit plans 

  

we recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in “other income expense – net” in our consolidated statements of income these gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years see note 15 for additional discussions regarding our assumptions 

  

depreciation our depreciation of assets including use of composite group depreciation for certain subsidiaries and estimates of useful lives is described in notes 1 and 7 

  

if all other factors were to remain unchanged we expect that a oneyear increase in the useful lives of our plant in service would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 3027 in our 2019 depreciation expense and that a oneyear decrease would have resulted in an increase of approximately 4196 in our 2019 depreciation expense see notes 7 and 8 for depreciation and amortization expense applicable to property plant and equipment including our finance lease rightofuse assets 

  

asset valuations and impairments goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but tested at least annually for impairment for impairment testing we estimate fair values using models that predominantly rely on the 

   

expected cash flows to be derived from the use of the asset we recorded an impairment in 2019 for our sky brasil trade name see note 9 

  

we test goodwill on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value if the fair value exceeds the book value then no impairment is measured we estimate fair values using an income approach also known as a discounted cash flow and a market multiple approach the income approach utilizes our 10year cash flow projections with a perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital the market multiple approach uses the multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to those offered by the reporting units in 2019 the calculated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their book values in all circumstances if either the projected rate of longterm growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 05 or if the discount rate increased by 05 the fair values would still be higher than the book value of the goodwill in the event of a 10 drop in the fair values of the reporting units the fair values still would have exceeded the book values of the reporting units 

  

we assess fair value for us wireless licenses using a discounted cash flow model the greenfield approach and a corroborative market approach based on auction prices depending upon auction activity the greenfield approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use inputs to the model include subscriber growth churn revenue per user capital investment and acquisition costs per subscriber ongoing operating costs and resulting ebitda margins we based our assumptions on a combination of average marketplace participant data and our historical results trends and business plans these licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis consistent with their use on a national scope for the united states for impairment testing we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels with a longterm growth rate reflecting expected longterm inflation trends we assume churn rates will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rates that are in line with industryleading churn we used a discount rate of 875 based on the optimal longterm capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows if either the projected rate of longterm growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 05 or if the discount rate increased by 05 the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value of the licenses the fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10 

  

orbital slots are also valued using the greenfield approach the projected cash flows are based on various factors including satellite cost other capital investment per subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber and usage per subscriber as well as revenue growth subscriber growth and churn rates for impairment testing purposes we assumed sustainable longterm growth assumptions consistent with the business plan and industry counterparts in the united states we used a discount rate of 85 to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows in 2019 the fair value of orbital slots was slightly lower than the prior year which exceeded the book value by approximately 10 in 2018 the decrease in fair value was driven by the transition of the video business to ott and streaming technology 

  

we review customer relationships licenses in mexico and other finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over their remaining life for this analysis we compare the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to its book value 

  

we review operating lease rightofuse assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicated that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life 

  

we periodically assess our network assets for impairment see note 1 

  

income taxes our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note 14 and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal state or foreign tax authorities 

we use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits utbs in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our utbs may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash 

  

new accounting standards 

   

  

beginning with 2019 interim and annual reporting periods we adopted the fasb’s new accounting guidance related to leasing the most significant impact of the new guidance was to our balance sheet as we recorded a rightofuse asset and corresponding liability for our operating leases existing at january 1 2019 we adopted the new leasing standard using a modified retrospective transition method as of the beginning of the period of adoption which did not require us to adjust the balance sheet for prior periods therefore affecting the comparability of our financial statements see note 1 for discussion of the impact of the standard 

  

see note 1 for discussion of the expected impact of other new standards 

  

other business matters 

unlimited data plan claims in october 2014 the ftc filed a civil suit in the us district court for the northern district of california against att mobility llc seeking injunctive relief and unspecified money damages under section 5 of the federal trade commission act the ftc’s allegations concern the application of att’s maximum bit rate mbr program to customers who enrolled in our unlimited data plan from 20072010 mbr temporarily reduces in certain instances the download speeds of a small portion of our legacy unlimited data plan customers each month after the customer exceeds a designated amount of data during the customer’s billing cycle mbr is an industrystandard practice that is designed to affect only the most dataintensive applications such as video streaming texts emails tweets social media posts internet browsing and many other applications are typically unaffected contrary to the ftc’s allegations our mbr program is permitted by our customer contracts was fully disclosed in advance to our unlimited data plan customers and was implemented to protect the network for the benefit of all customers we reached a tentative agreement stipulated order with the ftc staff in august 2019 pending ftc approval the ftc approved the stipulated order on november 4 2019 and the court approved and entered the order on december 3 2019 in the resolution of this matter we did not admit the ftc’s allegations and the settlement amount is not material to our financial results in addition to the ftc case several class actions were filed challenging our mbr program we have secured dismissals in each of these cases except roberts v att mobility llc which is ongoing 

  

labor contracts as of january 31 2020 we employed approximately 246000 persons approximately 40 of our employees are represented by the communications workers of america cwa the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew or other unions after expiration of the collective bargaining agreements work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached

environmental we are subject from time to time to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under federal state or local environmental laws we reference in our forms 10q and 10k certain environmental proceedings that could result in monetary sanctions exclusive of interest and costs of one hundred thousand dollars or more however we do not believe that any of those currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we had 12130 in cash and cash equivalents available at december 31 2019 cash and cash equivalents included cash of 2654 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of 9476 approximately 2681 of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign entities in accounts predominantly outside of the us and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation 

  

cash and cash equivalents increased 6926 since december 31 2018 in 2019 cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations including cash from an increased amount of sales and transfers of our receivables to third parties sale of investments issuance of longterm debt collateral received from banks and other participants in our derivative arrangements and issuances of nonconvertible perpetual preferred interests in subsidiaries and cumulative preferred stock 

   

these inflows were offset by cash used to meet the needs of the business including but not limited to payment of operating expenses debt repayments funding capital expenditures and vendor financing payments spectrum purchases and dividends to stockholders 

  

cash provided by or used in operating activities 

during 2019 cash provided by operating activities was 48668 compared to 43602 in 2018 higher operating cash flows in 2019 were primarily due to contributions from full year of warnermedia and higher cash flows from working capital initiatives including sales of receivables see note 18 partly offset by higher spend on film and television production and net tax payments in 2019 compared to net tax refunds in 2018 

  

we actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for noncapital items to optimize the use of our cash among other things we seek to make payments on 90day or greater terms while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost in addition for payments to a key supplier we have arrangements that allow us to extend payment terms up to 90 days at an additional cost to us referred to as supplier financing the net impact of supplier financing on cash from operating activities was to improve working capital 909 in 2019 and 1869 in 2018 all supplier financing payments are due within one year 

  

cash used in or provided by investing activities 

during 2019 cash used in investing activities totaled 16690 and consisted primarily of 19635 including interest during construction for capital expenditures 1616 lower than the prioryear and 982 of wireless spectrum offset by proceeds from the sales of our ownership interests in hulu and warnermedia’s headquarters hudson yards under a saleleaseback arrangement see note 6 

  

for capital improvements we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more referred to as vendor financing with some of our vendors which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities vendor financing payments were 3050 in 2019 compared to 560 in 2018 c apital expenditures in 2019 were 19635 and when including 3050 cash paid for vendor financing and excluding 1005 of firstnet reimbursements gross capital investment was 23690 450 higher than the prioryear the vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks including product development and related support systems in 2019 we placed 2632 of equipment in service under vendor financing arrangements compared to 2162 in 2018 and 1116 of assets related to the firstnet build compared to 1500 in 2018 total reimbursements from the government for firstnet were 1374 for 2019 and 1670 for 2018 predominately for capital expenditures 

  

the amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products capacity needs and network enhancements in 2020 we expect that our gross capital investment which includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing and excludes expected firstnet reimbursement of approximately 1000 will be in the 20000 range

credit facilities 

the following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k 

  

we use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status in december 2018 we amended our fiveyear revolving credit agreement the “amended and restated credit agreement” and concurrently entered into a new fiveyear agreement the “five year credit agreement” such that we now have two 7500 revolving credit agreements totaling 15000 the amended and restated credit agreement terminates on december 11 2021 and the five year credit agreement terminates on december 11 2023 no amounts were outstanding under either agreement as of december 31 2019 

  

in september 2019 we entered into and drew on a 1300 term loan credit agreement containing i a 125 year 400 facility due in 2020 baml tranche a facility ii a 225 year 400 facility due in 2021 baml tranche b facility and iii a 325 year 500 facility due in 2022 baml tranche c facility with bank of america na as agent no repayment had been made under these facilities as of december 31 2019 

  

we also utilize other external financing sources which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program 

  

each of our credit and loan agreements contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debttoebitda financial ratio covenant requiring att to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of not more than 35to1 as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities 

  

collateral arrangements 

during the year we amended collateral arrangements with certain counterparties to require cash collateral posting by att only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds under these arrangements counterparties are still required to post collateral during 2019 we received 1413 of cash collateral on a net basis primarily driven by the amended arrangements cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements see note 13 

  

other 

   

our total capital consists of debt longterm debt and debt maturing within one year and stockholders’ equity our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investees at december 31 2019 our debt ratio was 447 compared to 477 at december 31 2018 and 536 at december 31 2017 our net debt ratio was 414 at december 31 2019 compared to 462 at december 31 2018 and 372 at december 31 2017 the debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital and reflects debt issuances repayments and debt acquired in business combinations 

  

a significant amount of our cash outflows is related to tax items and benefits paid for current and former employees total taxes incurred collected and remitted by att during 2019 and 2018 were 24170 and 22172 these taxes include income franchise property sales excise payroll gross receipts and various other taxes and fees total health and welfare benefits provided to certain active and retired employees and their dependents totaled 4059 in 2019 with 941 paid from plan assets of those benefits 3707 related to medical and prescription drug benefits in addition in 2019 we prefunded 500 for future benefit payments during 2019 we paid 6356 of pension benefits out of plan assets 

  

during 2019 we received 4684 from the disposition of assets and when combined with capital received from issuing preferred interests to external investors an amendment of collateral arrangements and working capital monetization initiatives which include the sale of receivables total cash received from monetization efforts net of spectrum acquisitions was approximately 18000 we plan to continue to explore similar opportunities 

  

   

contractual obligations commitments and contingencies 

our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 are in the following table 

  

   

certain items were excluded from this table as the year of payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated since past trends were not deemed to be an indicator of future payment the obligations are immaterial or because the settlement of the obligation will not require the use of cash these items include deferred income tax liability of 59502 see note 14 net postemployment benefit obligations of 20316 expected pension and postretirement payments see note 15 other noncurrent liabilities of 13412 thirdparty debt guarantees and fair value of our interest rate swaps 

   

discussion and reconciliation of nongaap measure 

we believe the following measure is relevant and useful information to investors as it is used by management as a method of comparing performance with that of many of our competitors this supplemental measure should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute of our consolidated and segment financial information 

  

business solutions reconciliation 

we provide a supplemental discussion of our business solutions operations that is calculated by combining our mobility and business wireline business units and then adjusting to remove nonbusiness operations the following table presents a reconciliation of our supplemental business solutions results 

  

   

   

   

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates these risks along with other business risks impact our cost of capital it is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign exchange exposure in order to manage capital costs control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term in managing market risks we employ derivatives according to documented policies and procedures including interest rate swaps interest rate locks foreign currency exchange contracts and combined interest rate foreign currency contracts crosscurrency swaps we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we do not foresee significant changes in the strategies we use to manage market risk in the near future 

  

one of the most significant assumptions used in estimating our postretirement benefit obligations is the assumed weightedaverage discount rate which is the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants we determined our discount rate based on a range of factors including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred highquality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations in recent years the discount rates have been increasingly volatile and on average have been lower than in historical periods lower discount rates used to measure our pension and postretirement plans result in higher obligations future increases in these rates could result in lower obligations improved funded status and actuarial gains 

  

interest rate risk 

  

the majority of our financial instruments are medium and longterm fixedrate notes and debentures changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of these instruments the principal amounts by expected maturity average interest rate and fair value of our liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk are described in notes 12 and 13 in managing interest expense we control our mix of fixed and floating rate debt through term loans floating rate notes and interest rate swaps we have established interest rate risk limits that we closely monitor by measuring interest rate sensitivities in our debt and interest rate derivatives portfolios 

  

most of our foreigndenominated longterm debt has been swapped from fixedrate or floatingrate foreign currencies to fixedrate us dollars at issuance through crosscurrency swaps removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments likewise periodically we enter into interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixedrate debt we expect gains or losses in our crosscurrency swaps and interest rate locks to offset the losses and gains in the financial instruments they hedge 

   

  

following are our interest rate derivatives subject to material interest rate risk as of december 31 2019 the interest rates illustrated below refer to the average rates we expect to pay based on current and implied forward rates and the average rates we expect to receive based on derivative contracts the notional amount is the principal amount of the debt subject to the interest rate swap contracts  the fair value asset liability represents the amount we would receive pay if we terminated the contracts as of december 31 2019 

  

   

foreign exchange risk 

  

we principally use foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain film production costs denominated in foreign currencies we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our foreign affiliates and equity investments in foreign companies we have designated €1450 million aggregate principal amount of debt as a hedge of the variability of certain eurodenominated net investments of our subsidiaries the gain or loss on the debt that is designated as and is effective as an economic hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation is recorded as a currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income net on the consolidated balance sheet 

  

through crosscurrency swaps most of our foreigndenominated debt has been swapped from fixedrate or floatingrate foreign currencies to fixedrate us dollars at issuance removing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments we expect gains or losses in our crosscurrency swaps to offset the gains and losses in the financial instruments they hedge 

  

for the purpose of assessing specific risks we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations we had foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of 269 and a fair value of 89 outstanding at december 31 2019 

   




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting 

and financial disclosure 

  

during our two most recent fiscal years there has been no change in the independent accountant engaged as the principal accountant to audit our financial statements and the independent accountant has not expressed reliance on other independent accountants in its reports during such time period 

  




 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

the registrant maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the registrant is recorded processed summarized accumulated and communicated to its management including its principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2019 based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2019 

  

internal control over financial reporting 

  

a management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

history 

att formerly known as sbc communications inc sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corp’s attc local telephone companies on january 1 1984 we were spunoff from attc pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publiclytraded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states 

following our formation we have expanded our footprint and operations by acquiring various businesses most significantly 

      general 

we are a leading provider of telecommunications media and technology services globally the services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies our operating segments are organized as follows 

the communications segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the us or in us territories and businesses globally our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets this segment contains the following business units 

    

att inc 

 

 

the warnermedia segment develops produces and distributes feature films television gaming and other content over various physical and digital formats this segment contains the following business units 

   the latin america segment provides entertainment and wireless services outside of the us this segment contains the following business units 

  the xandr segment provides advertising services these services utilize data insights to develop highervalue targeted advertising 

our corporate and other group reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes and include 

    areas of focus 

with continuing advances in technology and in response to changing demands from our customers in recent years we have focused on providing enhanced broadband video and voice services we are also capitalizing on data insights from our directtoconsumer relationships and our premium video and digital advertising inventory to provide advertising that matters our acquisitions over the past few years and our continued investment in a premier network experience make our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2019 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below 

communications 

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending wireline satellite and wireless products we are offering services that take advantage of these more sophisticated technologies in particular our focus is on expanding our highspeed internet and video offerings and on developing ipbased services that allow customers to integrate their home or business wireline services with their mobile service during 2019 we will continue to develop and provide unique integrated video mobile and broadband solutions we believe offering integrated services facilitates our customers’ desire to view video anywhere on demand and encourages customer retention 

wireless service 

we are experiencing rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices and as more and more machines are being connected to the internet we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities to offer a variety of wireless communications services 

our 4g lte technology covers over 400 million people in north america and in the united states we cover all major metropolitan areas and almost 325 million people with our lte technology our 3g network provides services to customers using older handsets and connected devices we are contemplating the redeployment of spectrum currently used for our 3g services and project that we will discontinue service on our 3g network in early 2022 and will manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades as of december 31 2018 about 11 of our postpaid subscribers were using 3g 

 

att inc 

 

 

handsets and we expect them to transition to newer technologies we do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 

we are currently beginning the deployment of the latest wireless technology 5g in multiple us cities in late 2018 we were the first us company to introduce mobile 5g service in parts of 12 cities and plan to expand that deployment nationwide by early 2020 the introduction of 5g service is largely dependent on the development of 5g standards to that end we are one of the top north american wireless carrier contributors into 3rd generation partnership project’s 3gpp work on 5g standards we have been awarded the contract to provide national coverage for emergency personnel first responders by the first responder network authority firstnet which gives us access to a nationwide low band 20 mhz of spectrum we will continue to invest in our wireless network as we look to provide future service offerings and participate in technologies such as 5g and millimeterwave bands the increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5g technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services we expect that 5g will enhance our customers’ entire connected experience and not just provide faster speeds 

as the wireless industry has matured future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services on a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations we continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our longterm needs we have participated in recent fcc spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services 

internet protocol ip technology ip is generally used to describe the transmission of data which can include voice called voice over ip or voip using a softwarebased technology rather than a traditional telephone network softwarebased technology presents costsavings and growth opportunities by using bandwidth more efficiently than a legacy copper wire network and by improving our ability to provide data and video services to both fixed locations and mobile devices we are rapidly converting to a softwarebased network and managing the migration of wireline customers to services using ip we expect to continue this transition through at least 2020 softwarebased technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network sdn and network function virtualization nfv this network approach of which we are a global leader in our commitment to virtualize 75 of our network by 2020 delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of nextgeneration technology over the traditional hardwareintensive network approach our virtualized network will be able to support nextgeneration applications like 5g and ipbased services quickly and efficiently 

media 

we produce and distribute highquality video content to take advantage of growing global demand our media businesses use their strong brands distinctive intellectual property and global scale to produce and distribute quality content as the television industry continues to evolve from a distribution system using satellite and cable offerings to individual streaming video services we are wellpositioned to address and capitalize on these changes but we face risks and new sources of competition associated with these developments we plan in 2019 to continue launching more personalized services offered directly to consumers 

advertising 

our xandr segment relies on using data on an anonymous basis from our more than 170 million customer relationships to develop digital advertising that is more relevant to consumers advertisers are interested in capitalizing on our broad distribution and ability to offer more precise marketing to customers through a digital platform we also are expanding relationships with other broadband and video providers to use our digital platform to reach their audiences this segment experienced rapid growth in 2018 and we believe this growth will continue in 2019 

latin america 

we believe that the wireless model in the us with accelerating demand for mobile internet service and the associated economic benefits will be repeated around the world as companies invest in highspeed mobile networks due in part to changes in the legal and regulatory framework in mexico in 2015 we acquired mexican wireless operations to establish a seamless crossborder north american wireless network covering over 400 million people and businesses in the united states and mexico during 2018 we largely completed building a 4g lte network in mexico which covers approximately 100 million people and businesses

government regulation 

wireless communications providers must be licensed by the us federal communications commission fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fcc’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the highquality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically ten years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services 

the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of our satellite services which are licensed by the fcc and some of warnermedia’s businesses are also subject to obligations under the communications act and related fcc regulations in addition states representing a majority of our local service access lines have adopted legislation that enables us to provide ipbased video service through a single statewide or stateapproved franchise as opposed to the need to acquire hundreds or even thousands of municipalapproved franchises to offer a competitive video product we also are supporting efforts to update and improve regulatory treatment for retail services regulatory reform and passage of legislation is uncertain and depends on many factors 

in february 2015 the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to title ii of the communications act this order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fcc’s authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements att and several other parties appealed the fcc’s order in june 2016 a divided panel of the district of columbia court of appeals upheld the fcc’s rules by a 21 vote and petitions for rehearing en banc were denied in may 2017 petitions for a writ of certiorari at the us supreme court remain pending meanwhile in december 2017 the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization several parties including several state attorneys general net neutrality advocacy groups and others have appealed the fcc’s december 2017 decision those appeals which initially were consolidated in the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit were transferred at the request of the parties to the dc circuit although the fcc order expressly preempted inconsistent state or local measures a number of states are considering or have adopted legislation that would reimpose the very rules the fcc repealed and in some cases establish additional requirements that go beyond the fcc’s february 2015 order additionally some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements suits have recently been filed concerning laws in california and vermont and other lawsuits are possible we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet 

on april 20 2017 the fcc adopted an order that maintains light touch pricing regulation of packetbased services like ethernet and extends this “light touch” approach to highspeed tdm transport services and to most of our tdm channel termination services based on the application of a competitive market test for such services for those services that do not qualify for light touch regulation the order allows companies to offer volume and term discounts as well as contract tariffs several parties appealed the fcc’s decision in august 2018 the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit largely upheld the fcc decision but found that the fcc had not provided adequate notice of the possibility that it might apply light touch regulation to all transport services the fcc has since remedied that notice deficiency and has proposed to reinstate its light touch approach for transport services 

privacyrelated legislation has been considered in a number of states the policy environment is complex and rapidly evolving legislative and regulatory action could result in increased costs of compliance claims against broadband internet access service providers content owners and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data in june 2018 the state of california enacted comprehensive privacy legislation that gives california consumers the right to know what personal information is being collected about them to know whether and to whom it is sold or disclosed and to access and request deletion of this information subject to certain exceptions it also gives consumers the right to optout of the sale of personal information the law applies the same rules to all companies that collect consumer information the new law could significantly affect how data markets operate and will impose implementation costs and challenges we will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules of the internet including a federal privacy framework

history

att formerly known as sbc communications inc sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corps attc local telephone companies on january 1 1984 we were spunoff from attc pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publiclytraded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states our subsidiaries merged with pacific telesis group in 1997 southern new england telecommunications corporation in 1998 and ameritech corporation in 1999 thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec into a total of 13 states in november 2005 one of our subsidiaries merged with attc creating one of the worlds leading telecommunications providers in connection with the merger we changed the name of our company from sbc communications inc to att inc in december 2006 one of our subsidiaries merged with bellsouth corporation bellsouth making us the ilec in an additional nine states with the bellsouth acquisition we also acquired bellsouths 40 percent economic interest in att mobility llc att mobility formerly cingular wireless llc resulting in 100 percent ownership of att mobility in 2014 we completed the acquisition of wireless provider leap wireless international inc leap and sold our ilec operations in connecticut which we had previously acquired in 1998 in 2015 we completed acquisitions of wireless properties in mexico and directv a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the united states and latin america our services and products are marketed under the att cricket directv sky and unefon brand names

scope

we are a leading provider of communications and digital entertainment services in the united states and the world we offer our services and products to consumers in the us mexico and latin america and to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide we also own and operate three regional tv sports networks and retain noncontrolling interests in another regional sports network a joint venture that aims to create media and digital brands and a network dedicated to gamerelated programming as well as internet interactive game playing

the services and products that we offer vary by market and include wireless and wireline communications services including databroadband and voice digital video services telecommunications equipment managed networking and wholesale services our operating segments are organized as follows

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our corporate and other unit includes 1 operations that are not considered reportable segments and that are no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market and 2 impacts of corporatewide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated including interest costs and expected return on plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans

with continuing advances in technology and in response to changing demands from our customers in recent years we have focused on providing enhanced broadband video and voice services in 2015 we purchased directv to expand our involvement in the digital entertainment space by using the nationwide reach of directv and its superior contentowner relationships to improve our video offerings w e also purchased wireless operations in mexico moving quickly to build a worldclass mobile business in a country with a strong economic outlook a growing middle class and cultural and geographic ties to the united states these acquisitions and our continued investment in a premier network experience make our customers lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in late 2016 we took another step in our strategy of providing an unmatched communication and entertainment experience for our customers when we agreed to purchase time warner inc time warner a global leader in creating premium media and entertainment content in 2018 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below

wireless

we provide wireless data and voice services we are experiencing rapid growth in video and data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wired and wireless devices and as more and more machines are being connected to the internet

as of december 31 2017 we served 157 million wireless subscribers in north america with nearly 142 million in the united states our lte technology covers over 400 million people in north america and in the united states we cover all major metropolitan areas and over 320 million people with our lte technology we also provide 4g coverage using another technology hspa and when combined with our upgraded backhaul network we are able to enhance our network capabilities and provide superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services our wireless network also relies on other gsm digital transmission technologies for 3g data communications 

we are currently planning for deployment of the latest wireless technology 5g and are conducting 5g trials in multiple cities we expect to be the first us company to introduce mobile 5g service in 12 markets by late 2018 additional we are one of the top north american wireless carrier contributors into 3rd generation partnership projects 3gpp work on 5g standards since early 2016 the increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5g technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of video and data services we expect that 5g will be about the entire connected experience not just fast speeds

as the wireless industry has matured future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative video and data services on a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations we continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our longterm needs we have participated in recent fcc spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services we also have been awarded the contract to provide national coverage for emergency personnel first responders by the first responder network authority which will give us access to a nationwide low band 20 mhz of spectrum see other business matters we will continue to invest in our wireless network as we look to provide future service offerings and participate in technologies such as 5g and millimeterwave bands

business solutions

we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both fixed and mobile to businesses customers including multinational companies governmental and wholesale customers and individual subscribers who purchase wireless services through employersponsored plans

internet protocol ip technology

ip is generally used to describe the transmission of data which can include voice called voice over ip or voip using a softwarebased technology rather than a traditional wire and physical switchbased telephone network this technology can provide voice and data services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a legacy copper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wire network using this technology also presents growth opportunities especially in providing data and video services to both fixed locations and mobile devices to take advantage of both these growth and costsavings opportunities we are rapidly converting our network to a softwarebased network and managing the migration of wireline customers in our current 21state ilec service area to services using ip and expect to continue this transition through at least 2020

software based technologies like ip align with atts global leadership in software defined network sdn and network virtualization nfv this network approach of which att is a global leader in its commitment to virtualize 75 of our network by 2020 delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of nextgeneration technology over the traditional hardwareintensive network approach

atts virtualized network will be able to support nextgeneration applications like 5g and ipbased services quickly and efficiently in fact were building many of these nextgeneration and sdn applications using open source software were also contributing code back to the open source community so other innovators can take advantage of what weve learned in this transformation were leading the charge to the next generation of the network

integration of databroadband and entertainment services

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending wireline satellite and wireless services we are offering services that take advantage of these more sophisticated technologies in particular we continue to focus on expanding our highspeed internet and video offerings and on developing ipbased services that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with their mobile service during 2018 we will continue to develop and provide unique integrated video mobile and broadband solutions in 2017 we expanded our offering of directv now an overthetop video service data usage from directv now will not count toward data limits for customers who bundle this product with our wireless service we believe bundling this offering facilitates our customers desire to view video anywhere on demand and encourages customer retention

international

we believe that the wireless model in the us with exploding demand for mobile internet service and the associated economic benefits will be repeated around the world as companies invest in highspeed mobile networks due in part to changes in the legal and regulatory framework in mexico in 2015 we acquired mexican wireless operations to establish a unique seamless crossborder north american wireless network covering over 400 million people and businesses in the united states and mexico during 2018 we will continue to build a worldclass mobile business and network in mexico and expect to cover 100 million people and businesses

government regulation

wireless communications providers must be licensed by the us federal communications commission fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fccs rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the highquality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically 10 years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services

the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of our satellite services which are licensed by the fcc in addition states representing a majority of our local service access lines have adopted legislation that enables us to provide ipbased video service through a single statewide or stateapproved franchise as opposed to the need to acquire hundreds or even thousands of municipalapproved franchises to offer a competitive video product we also are supporting efforts to update and improve regulatory treatment for retail services regulatory reform and passage of legislation is uncertain and depends on many factors

in february 2015 the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to extensive public utilitystyle regulation under the telecom act the order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fccs authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements att and several other parties appealed the fccs order in june 2016 a divided panel of the dc court of appeals upheld the fccs rules by a 21 vote and petitions for rehearing en banc were denied in may 2017 petitions for a writ of certiorari at the us supreme court remain pending meanwhile on december 14 2017 the fcc reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 in lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization the order will take effect after the office of management and budget approves the new disclosure requirements

 

on april 20 2017 the fcc adopted an order bringing to an end a decadelong proceeding regarding pricing of high capacity data services by incumbent local telephone companies like att the order declines to require advanced approval of rates

 

 

 

 

 

for packetbased services like ethernet opting instead to continue the existing regime under which such rates are presumed lawful but may be challenged in a complaint in addition the order extends this light touch approach to highspeed tdm transport services and to most of our tdm channel termination services based on the application of a competitive market test for such services for those services that do not qualify for light touch regulation the order continues to subject the services to price cap regulation but allows companies to offer volume and term discounts as well as contract tariffs several parties appealed the fccs decision these appeals were consolidated in the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit where they remain pending

in november 2017 the fcc updated and streamlined certain rules governing pole attachments copper retirement and service discontinuances these changes should facilitate our ability to replace legacy facilities and services with advanced broadband infrastructure and services

our ilec subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services including local longdistance and network access services provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings these subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to intercarrier compensation interconnection and interstate and international rates and services including interstate access charges access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers

we have also started planning for deployment of the latest wireless technology 5g and are currently testing in our labs and in the field various ways to deploy that technology we expect global 5g technology standards to be set over the next two years or so enabling companies to begin commercial deployment thereafter the increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5g technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of video and data services

as the wireless industry continues to mature future wireless growth will become increasingly dependent on our ability to offer innovative video and data services and a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations we continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity as well as to secure and utilize spectrum that meets our longterm needs to that end we submitted winning bids for 251 aws spectrum licenses for a nearnationwide contiguous block of highquality aws spectrum in the aws3 auction fcc auction 97 our strategy also includes redeploying spectrum previously used for basic 2g services to support more advanced mobile internet services on our 3g and 4g networks we have bid on firstnet the first responder network authority which if awarded will provide access to a nationwide low band 20 mhz of spectrum assuming all states “opt in” and are participating in the fcc 600 mhz auction auction 1000 we will continue to invest in our wireless network as we look to provide future service offerings and participate in technologies such as 5g and millimeterwave bands

internet protocol ip technology

ip is generally used to describe the transmission of data which can include voice called voice over ip or voip using a softwarebased technology rather than a traditional wire and physical switchbased telephone network a company using this technology can provide voice and data services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network using this technology also presents growth opportunities especially in providing data and video services to both fixed locations and mobile devices to take advantage of both these growth and costsavings opportunities we have encouraged the migration of wireline customers in our current 21state ilec service area to services using ip and expect to continue this transition through at least 2020

government regulation

wireless communications providers must be licensed by the us federal communications commission fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fcc’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the highquality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically 10 years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services

the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of our satellite services which are licensed by the fcc in addition states representing a majority of our local service access lines have adopted legislation that enables us to provide ipbased video service through a single statewide or stateapproved franchise as opposed to the need to acquire hundreds or even thousands of municipalapproved franchises to offer a competitive video product we also are supporting efforts to update and improve regulatory treatment for retail services regulatory reform and passage of legislation is uncertain and depends on many factors

in february 2015 the fcc released an order in response to the dc circuit’s january 2014 decision adopting new rules and classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access as telecommunications services subject to comprehensive regulation under the telecommunications act of 1996 the fcc’s decision significantly expands its existing authority to regulate the provision of fixed and mobile broadband internet access services the fcc also asserted jurisdiction over internet interconnection arrangements which until now have been unregulated these actions could have an adverse impact on our fixed and mobile broadband services and operating results att and several other parties including us telecom and ctia trade groups have challenged the fcc’s order

history

att formerly known as sbc communications inc sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corps attc local telephone companies on january 1 1984 we were spunoff from attc pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publiclytraded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states our subsidiaries merged with pacific telesis group in 1997 southern new england telecommunications corporation in 1998 and ameritech corporation in 1999 thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec into a total of 13 states in november 2005 one of our subsidiaries merged with attc creating one of the worlds leading telecommunications providers in connection with the merger we changed the name of our company from sbc communications inc to att inc in december 2006 one of our subsidiaries merged with bellsouth corporation bellsouth making us the ilec in an additional nine states with the bellsouth acquisition we also acquired bellsouths 40 percent economic interest in att mobility llc att mobility formerly cingular wireless llc resulting in 100 percent ownership of att mobility in 2014 we completed the acquisition of wireless provider leap wireless international inc leap and sold our ilec operations in connecticut which we had previously acquired in 1998 in 2015 we completed acquisitions of wireless properties in mexico and directv a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the united states and latin america our services and products are marketed under the att cricket directv sky iusacell unefon and nextel mexico brand names

scope

we are a leading provider of communications and digital entertainment services in the united states and the world we offer our services and products to consumers in the us mexico and latin america and to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide we also own and operate three regional sports networks and retain noncontrolling interests in another regional sports network and a network dedicated to gamerelated programming as well as internet interactive game playing

the services and products that we offer vary by market and include wireless communications databroadband and internet services digital video services local and longdistance telephone services telecommunications equipment managed networking and wholesale services in conjunction with our july 24 2015 acquisition of directv we reorganized our operating subsidiaries as follows corresponding to our operating segments for financial reporting purposes

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our corporate and other information includes unallocated corporate expenses operations that are no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market our portion of results from our equity investments and impacts from corporatewide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated

with continuing advances in technology and in response to changing demands from our customers in recent years we have focused on providing broadband video and voice services in 2015 we purchased directv to expand our involvement in the digital entertainment space the nationwide reach of directv and superior contentowner relationships significantly improves the economics and expands the geographic reach of our preexisting att uverse ® video service w e also purchased wireless operations in mexico moving quickly to build a worldclass mobile business in a country with a strong economic outlook a growing middle class and close trade cultural and geographic ties to the us these acquisitions and our continued investment in a premier network experience make our customers lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2016 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below

wireless

att mobility began operations in october 2000 as a joint venture between us and bellsouth and in 2004 acquired att wireless services inc upon our acquisition of bellsouth in 2006 att mobility became a whollyowned subsidiary

in the united states we now cover all major metropolitan areas and more than 300 million people with our lte technology we also provide 4g coverage using another technology hspa and when combined with our upgraded backhaul network we are able to enhance our network capabilities and provide superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services our wireless network also relies on other gsm digital transmission technologies for 3g and 2g data communications as of december 31 2015 we served more than 128 million subscribers

as the wireless industry continues to mature we believe that future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative video and data services and a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations we continue to face significant spectrum and capacity constraints on our wireless network in certain markets we expect such constraints to increase and expand to additional markets in the coming years while we are continuing to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity our capacity constraints could affect the quality of existing voice and data services and our ability to launch new advanced wireless broadband services unless we are able to obtain more spectrum any longterm spectrum solution will require that the fcc make additional spectrum available to the wireless industry to meet the expanding needs of our subscribers we will continue to attempt to address spectrum and capacity constraints on a marketbymarket basis to that end we submitted winning bids for 251 advanced wireless service aws spectrum licenses for a nearnationwide contiguous block of highquality aws spectrum in the aws3 auction fcc auction 97 the fcc announced that the 600 mhz auction auction 1000 is scheduled to begin on march 29 2016

also as part of our efforts to improve our network performance and help address the need for additional spectrum capacity we are redeploying spectrum currently used for basic 2g services to support more advanced mobile internet services on our 3g and 4g networks we are managing this process consistent with previous network upgrades and are transitioning customers on a marketbymarket basis from 2g networks to our more advanced 3g and 4g networks we expect to fully discontinue service on our 2g networks by approximately january 1 2017 as of december 31 2015 about 1 percent of atts postpaid subscribers used handsets only capable of using 2g services we do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our operating results

business solutions

we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both fixed and mobile to businesses governmental and wholesale customers worldwide

internet protocol technology

ip is generally used to describe the transmission of data which can include voice called voice over ip or voip using a softwarebased technology rather than a traditional wire and physical switchbased telephone network a company using this technology can provide voice and data services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network using this technology also presents growth opportunities especially in providing data and video services to both fixed locations and mobile devices to take advantage of both these growth and costsavings opportunities we have encouraged the migration of wireline customers in our current 21state ilec service area to services using ip and expect to continue this transition through at least 2020

 

 

 

integration of databroadband and entertainment services

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on expanding our highspeed internet and video offerings and on developing ipbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business fixed services with their mobile service during 2016 we will continue to develop and provide unique integrated video mobile   and broadband solutions

international

we believe that the wireless model in the us with exploding demand for mobile internet service and the associated economic benefits will be repeated around the world as companies invest in highspeed mobile networks due in part to recent changes in the legal and regulatory framework in mexico during 2015 we invested in mexican wireless operations to establish a unique seamless crossborder north american wireless network covering 355 million people and businesses in the us and mexico during 2016 we will continue to build a worldclass mobile business and network in mexico

government regulation

wireless communications providers must be licensed by the federal communications commission fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fccs rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high quality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically ten years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services

the communications act of 1934 and other related acts give the fcc broad authority to regulate the us operations of our satellite services which are licensed by the fcc in addition states representing a majority of our local service access lines have adopted legislation that enables us to provide ipbased video service through a single statewide or stateapproved franchise as opposed to the need to acquire hundreds or even thousands of municipalapproved franchises to offer competitive video services we also are supporting efforts to update and improve regulatory treatment for retail services regulatory reform and passage of legislation is uncertain and depends on many factors

in february 2015 the fcc released an order in response to the dc circuits january 2014 decision adopting new rules and reclassifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to comprehensive regulation under the telecommunications act of 1996 the fccs decision significantly expands the fccs existing authority to regulate the provision of fixed and mobile broadband internet access services the fcc also asserted jurisdiction over internet interconnection arrangements which until now have been unregulated these actions could have an adverse impact on our fixed and mobile broadband services and operating results att and several other parties including us telecom and ctia trade groups have appealed the fccs order

history

att formerly known as sbc communications inc sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corps attc local telephone companies on january 1 1984 we were spunoff from attc pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publiclytraded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states our subsidiaries merged with pacific telesis group in 1997 southern new england telecommunications corporation in 1998 and ameritech corporation in 1999 thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec into a total of 13 states in november 2005 one of our subsidiaries merged with attc creating one of the worlds leading telecommunications providers in connection with the merger we changed the name of our company from sbc communications inc to att inc in december 2006 one of our subsidiaries merged with bellsouth corporation bellsouth making us the ilec in an additional nine states with the bellsouth acquisition we thereby acquired bellsouths 40 percent economic interest in att mobility llc att mobility formerly cingular wireless llc resulting in 100 percent ownership of att mobility substantially all of our services and products are marketed under the att brand name in 2014 we completed the acquisition of wireless provider leap wireless international inc leap and sold our ilec operations in connecticut which we had previously acquired in 1998

scope

we are a leading provider of telecommunications services in the united states and the world we offer our services and products to consumers in the us and services and products to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide

the services and products that we offer vary by market and include wireless communications databroadband and internet services video services local exchange services longdistance services telecommunications equipment managed networking and wholesale services we group our operating subsidiaries as follows corresponding to our two operating segments for financial reporting purposes

 

 

our corporate and other information includes unallocated corporate expenses our portion of results from our equity investments and impacts from corporatewide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated

our wireline subsidiaries operate as the ilec in 21 states alabama arkansas california illinois indiana florida georgia kentucky louisiana kansas michigan mississippi missouri nevada north carolina ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas and wisconsin 21state area these subsidiaries are subject to regulation by each state in which they operate and by the federal communications commission fcc wireless service providers are regulated by the fcc additional information relating to regulation acquisitions and dispositions and other strategic matters are contained under the heading government regulation and in the annual report under the headings operating environment and trends of the business and other business matters and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2

 

 

 

with continuing advances in technology and in response to changing demands from our customers we have focused on providing broadband video and voice services over both our wireless and wireline platforms we have also agreed to purchase directv to expand our offerings to satellite technology we make our customers lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2015 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below

wireless

att mobility began operations in october 2000 as a joint venture between us and bellsouth and in 2004 acquired att wireless services inc upon our acquisition of bellsouth in 2006 att mobility became a whollyowned subsidiary

in the united states we now cover all major metropolitan areas and more than 300 million people with our lte technology we also provide 4g coverage using another technology hspa and when combined with our upgraded backhaul network we are able to enhance our network capabilities and provide superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services our wireless network also relies on other gsm digital transmission technologies for 3g and 2g data communications as of december 31 2014 we served more than 120 million subscribers

as the wireless industry continues to mature we believe that future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services and a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations we are facing significant spectrum and capacity constraints on our wireless network in certain markets we expect such constraints to increase and expand to additional markets in the coming years while we are continuing to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity our capacity constraints could affect the quality of existing voice and data services and our ability to launch new advanced wireless broadband services unless we are able to obtain more spectrum any longterm spectrum solution will require that the fcc make additional spectrum available to the wireless industry to meet the expanding needs of our subscribers we will continue to attempt to address spectrum and capacity constraints on a marketbymarket basis to that end we closed nearly 50 deals to acquire spectrum and wireless operations during 2014 in addition we also acquired leap in march 2014 which enabled us to expand our spectrum position in a costeffective manner in january 2015 we submitted winning bids for 251 advanced wireless service aws spectrum licenses for a nearnationwide contiguous block of highquality aws spectrum in the aws3 auction fcc auction 97 for 18189

also as part of our efforts to improve our network performance and help address the need for additional spectrum capacity we are redeploying spectrum currently used for basic 2g services to support more advanced mobile internet services on our 3g and 4g networks we are managing this process consistent with previous network upgrades and are transitioning customers on a marketbymarket basis from 2g networks to our more advanced 3g and 4g networks we expect to fully discontinue service on our 2g networks by approximately january 1 2017 as of december 31 2014 about 2 percent of atts postpaid subscribers used handsets only capable of using 2g services we do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our operating results

 

in january 2015 we completed the acquisition of gsf telecom holdings sapi de cv and announced an agreement to acquire nii holdings inc another mexican wireless provider these two acquisitions will give us a gsm network covering both the us and mexico and enable our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies networks we believe this seamless access will prove very attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity

business customers 

we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both wireless and wireline to large businesses governmental and wholesale customers worldwide we expect to offer similar services to small and mediumbusinesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers we also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services

 

 

databroadband

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on expanding our att uverse high speed broadband and video offerings and on developing ipbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service

uverse services during 2014 we continued to expand our offerings of uverse high speed internet and tv services as part of project velocity ip we announced a goal to expand our ipbroadband service to approximately 57 million customer locations and we achieved that goal during 2014 as of december 31 2014 we had 125 million total uverse subscribers highspeed internet and video including 122 million internet and 59 million video subscribers subscribers to both services are only counted once in the total

we believe that our uverse tv service is a video service under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation petitions have been filed at the fcc alleging that the manner in which we provision public educational and governmental peg programming over our uverse tv service conflicts with federal law if courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our uverse services were to decide that federal state andor local cable regulation were applicable to our uverse services or if the fcc state agencies or the courts were to rule that we must deliver peg programming in a manner substantially different from the way we do today or in ways that are inconsistent with our current network architecture it could have a material adverse effect on the cost and extent of our uverse offerings

internet protocol technology   ip is generally used to describe the transmission of data which can include voice called voice over ip or voip using a softwarebased technology rather than a traditional wire and physical switchbased telephone network a company using this technology can provide voice and data services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation using this technology also presents growth opportunities especially in providing data and video services to both fixed locations and mobile devices to take advantage of both these growth and costsavings opportunities we have begun the migration of wireline customers in our current 21state area to services using ip and expect to continue this transition through at least 2020

business operations

operating segments

our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and are managed accordingly we analyze our operating segments based on segment income before income taxes we make our capital allocation decisions based on the strategic needs of the business needs of the network wireless or wireline providing services and to provide emerging services to our customers actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postemployment benefits interest expense and other income expense – net are managed only on a total company basis and are accordingly reflected only in consolidated results therefore these items are not included in the calculation of each segments reportable results the customers and long lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the united states each segments percentage of total segment operating revenue and income calculations is derived from our segment results we have two reportable segments 1 wireless and 2 wireline

wireless data services continue to be a growing area of our business representing an increasing share of our overall subscriber revenue we are experiencing solid growth from both consumer and enterprise wireless data services as an increasing number of our subscribers have upgraded their handsets to more advanced integrated devices and are using datacentric tablets we are also seeing rapid growth in demand for new datacentric connected devices such as location and navigation aids monitoring and other devices we offer mobile share plans which allow sharing of voice text and data across multiple devices att next sm att next a program allowing subscribers to more frequently upgrade handsets using an installment payment plan and in january 2015 began offering rollover data on mobile share value plans which allows unused shareable plan data to be rolled over and used within the next month such offerings are intended to encourage existing subscribers to upgrade their current services andor add connected devices attract subscribers from other providers and minimize subscriber churn participation in these plans continues to increase customers in our connected device category eg users of navigation aids monitoring devices and ereaders purchase those devices from thirdparty suppliers that buy data access supported by our network other datacentric device users are classified as either postpaid customers primarily tablet netbook and notebook users or prepaid customers since they purchase service directly from us we continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and applications developers in order to further capitalize on the continued growth in the demand for wireless data services

 

 

our postpaid wireless service is provided under two alternatives 1 for subscribers who purchase their equipment under the traditional device subsidy model service contracts are for two year periods with an increasing portion of these subscribers receiving unlimited voice and texting services in conjunction with data services purchased through our mobile share value plans and 2 for subscribers purchasing a device on installments under the att next program no annual service contract is signed but the device must be paid in full if the customer chooses to drop their service from att our prepaid service is provided to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance our wireless services include data and voice services including longdistance service and roaming services roaming services enable our subscribers to utilize other carriers networks when they are roaming outside our network footprint we also charge fees to other carriers for providing roaming services to their customers when their customers utilize our network

equipment –   we sell a wide variety of handsets wirelessly enabled computers ie tablets and notebooks and personal computer wireless data cards manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services we sell through our own companyowned stores agents or thirdparty retail stores like other wireless service providers we have provided postpaid contract subscribers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate renew or upgrade service to reduce these subsidies and provide our customers with more service options we offer our att next program which allows customers to buy handsets on an installment basis in exchange for discounted service charges along with other benefits and we also offer new customers the opportunity to bring their own device a majority of our postpaid customers using smartphones no longer purchase subsidized handsets as a result of these customer trends regarding handsets we expect equipment revenues to continue to increase in 2015 along with a proportionate decline in service revenues we also sell accessories such as carrying cases handsfree devices batteries battery chargers and other items to consumers as well as to agents and thirdparty distributors for resale

our wireline subsidiaries provide both retail and wholesale communication services domestically and internationally our wireline segment provided approximately 44 of 2014 segment operating revenues and 25 of our 2014 total segment income we divide our wireline services into two productbased categories service and equipment

service – revenues from our traditional voice services have been declining as customers have been switching to wireless or voip services provided by either us cable or other internetbased providers in addition the continuing slow economic growth and business starts have led some wireline customers to terminate their residential or business phone service as individuals have lost jobs or otherwise combined households and businesses have not added jobs we have responded by offering packages of combined voice and data services including broadband and video and intend to continue this strategy during 2015we provide data services that rely on ipbased technology and data services that rely on older circuitbased technology we provide businesses voice applications over ipbased networks ie enhanced virtual private networks or evpn over the past several years we have built out our new ipmpls internet protocolmultiprotocol label switching network to supplement our ipbased product set and eventually replace our older circuitbased networks and services these products allow us to provide highly complex global data networks additional ipbased services include internet access and network integration dedicated internet and enterprise networking services uverse services and related data equipment sales these advanced ipbased services continued to grow during 2014 as customers shift from our older circuitbased services advanced ipdata now represents approximately 35 of our revenues from wireline business customers we expect this trend to continue in 2015 as both consumers and businesses continue to use more services based on internet access and demand everincreasing transmission speeds especially for video to align with these trends we continue to reconfigure our wireline network to take advantage of the latest technologies and services

major classes of service

the following table sets forth the percentage of total consolidated reported operating revenues by any class of service that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated total operating revenues in any of the last three fiscal years

 

government regulation

wireless communications providers must be licensed by the fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fccs rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high quality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically ten years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services

on january 14 2014 the dc circuit released its decision on verizons appeal of the fccs net neutrality rules those rules prohibited providers of fixed mass market internet access service from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices the rules prohibited providers of mobile broadband internet access service from blocking consumers from accessing lawful websites or applications that compete with the providers own voice or video telephony services the rules also imposed transparency requirements on providers of both fixed and mobile broadband internet access services requiring public disclosure of information regarding network management practices performance and commercial terms of their service offerings in addition the rules prohibited providers of fixed but not mobile broadband internet access service from unreasonably discriminating in their transmission of lawful network traffic

in its decision the court found the fcc had authority under section 706 of the act which directs the fcc and state commissions to promote broadband deployment to adopt rules designed to preserve the open internet but vacated and remanded the antidiscrimination and noblocking rules on the ground that they impermissibly imposed common carrier regulation on broadband internet access service the court held that having declared broadband internet access services to be information services the fcc could not regulate them as telecommunications services the court did not vacate the transparency rules 

the courts finding that section 706 provides the fcc independent authority to adopt rules to promote broadband deployment appears to give the fcc broad authority to regulate the internet and more generally ipbased services provided the fcc finds such regulation promotes deployment of broadband infrastructure in addition because section 706a grants authority to both the fcc and the states to adopt rules to promote broadband deployment states could attempt to rely on that provision to regulate broadband services although the states authority to do so appears to be narrower than the fccs in november 2014 the president issued a statement urging the fcc to reclassify both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to comprehensive regulation under title ii of the communications act of 1934 the act although the president also recommended that the fcc refrain from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband service this proposal if adopted and upheld would significantly expand the fcc existing authority to regulate the provision of fixed and mobile broadband internet access services the fcc now appears poised to adopt this proposal along with expanding the net neutrality rules into mobile broadband internet access service in addition the fcc may assert jurisdiction over internet interconnection arrangements which until now have been unregulated the adoption of these proposals will create significant uncertainty in the telecom industry and lead to protracted litigation over the extent of the rules if these proposals are adopted they could have a material adverse impact on our fixed and mobile broadband services and operating results

 

 

our wireline subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services including local longdistance and network access services provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings these subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to intercarrier compensation interconnection and interstate and international rates and services including interstate access charges access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to compensate our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers

our subsidiaries operating outside the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided regulation is generally limited to operational licensing authority for the provision of enterprise services

history 

att formerly known as sbc communications inc sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corp’s attc local telephone companies on january 1 1984 we were spunoff from attc pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publiclytraded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states our subsidiaries merged with pacific telesis group in 1997 southern new england telecommunications corporation in 1998 and ameritech corporation in 1999 thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec into a total of 13 states in november 2005 one of our subsidiaries merged with attc creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers in connection with the merger we changed the name of our company from “sbc communications inc” to “att inc” in december 2006 one of our subsidiaries merged with bellsouth corporation bellsouth making us the ilec in an additional nine states with the bellsouth acquisition we thereby acquired bellsouth’s 40 percent economic interest in att mobility llc att mobility formerly cingular wireless llc resulting in 100 percent ownership of att mobility substantially all of our services and products are marketed under the att brand name in 2013 we launched a new wireless brand aio which offers prepaid services and devices with no annual contract 

scope 

we are a leading provider of telecommunications services in the united states and the world we offer our services and products to consumers in the us and services and products to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide 

the services and products that we offer vary by market and include wireless communications local exchange services longdistance services databroadband and internet services video services telecommunications equipment managed networking and wholesale services we group our operating subsidiaries as follows corresponding to our operating segments for financial reporting purposes 

 

 

 

our local exchange subsidiaries operate as the ilec in 22 states alabama arkansas california connecticut illinois indiana florida georgia kentucky louisiana kansas michigan mississippi missouri nevada north carolina ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas and wisconsin 22state area in december 2013 we agreed to sell our local exchange operations in connecticut our local exchange subsidiaries are subject to regulation by each state in which they operate and by the federal communications commission fcc wireless service providers are regulated by the fcc additional information relating to regulation and pending deals including the connecticut operations sale are contained under the heading “government regulation” and in the annual report under the headings “operating environment and trends of the business” and “other business matters” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

 

  

  

 

with the expansion of our company through acquisitions and the resulting ownership consolidation of att mobility and with continuing advances in technology our services offerings now combine our traditional wireline and wireless services we make our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2014 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below 

wireless 

att mobility began operations in october 2000 as a joint venture between us and bellsouth and in 2004 acquired att wireless services inc upon our acquisition of bellsouth in 2006 att mobility became a whollyowned subsidiary as of december 31 2013 we served more than 110 million subscribers 

in the united states we now cover all major metropolitan areas and nearly 280 million people with our lte technology we expect to cover approximately 300 million people and to be essentially complete by the summer of 2014 we also provide 4g coverage using various other technologies umts and hspa and when combined with our upgraded backhaul we are able to enhance our network capabilities and provide superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services our wireless network also relies on other gsm digital transmission technologies for 3g and 2g data communications as of december 31 2013 we served more than 110 million subscribers we continue to expand the number of locations including airports and cafés where customers can access broadband internet connections using wireless fidelity local radio frequency commonly referred to as wifi technology 

as the wireless industry continues to mature we believe that future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services and a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations we are facing significant spectrum and capacity constraints on our wireless network in certain markets we expect such constraints to increase and expand to additional markets in the coming years while we are continuing to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity our capacity constraints could affect the quality of existing voice and data services and our ability to launch new advanced wireless broadband services unless we are able to obtain more spectrum any longterm spectrum solution will require that the fcc make new or existing spectrum available to the wireless industry to meet the expanding needs of our subscribers we will continue to attempt to address spectrum and capacity constraints on a marketbymarket basis to that end we closed more than 60 deals to acquire spectrum and wireless operations during 2013 much of the recently acquired spectrum came from an innovative solution in which we obtained fcc approval to use wireless communication services spectrum for mobile broadband for the first time 

also as part of our efforts to improve our network performance and help address the need for additional spectrum capacity we intend to redeploy spectrum currently used for basic 2g services to support more advanced mobile internet services on our 3g and 4g networks we will continue to manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades and will transition customers on a marketbymarket basis from 2g networks to our more advanced 3g and 4g networks we expect to fully discontinue service on our 2g networks by approximately january 1 2017 as of december 31 2013 about 4 percent of att’s postpaid subscribers used 2gcapable handsets we do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our operating results 

business customers 

we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both wireless and wireline to large businesses governmental and wholesale customers worldwide we expect to offer similar services to small and mediumbusinesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers we also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services 

databroadband 

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on expanding our att uverse highspeed broadband and video offerings and on developing ipbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service 

  

  

 

uverse services during 2013 we continued to expand our offerings of uverse high speed internet and tv services as of december 31 2013 we are marketing uverse services to approximately 27 million customer locations locations eligible to receive uverse service as of december 31 2013 we had 107 million total uverse subscribers highspeed internet and video including 104 million internet and 55 million video subscribers subscribers to both services are only counted once in the total as part of project velocity ip vip we plan to expand our ipbroadband service to approximately 57 million customer locations including uverse services to a total of 33 million customer locations we expect to be substantially complete in the 2015 and 2016 timeframe 

we believe that our uverse tv service is a “video service” under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation petitions have been filed at the fcc alleging that the manner in which we provision “public educational and governmental” peg programming over our uverse tv service conflicts with federal law and a lawsuit has been filed in a california state superior court raising similar allegations under california law if courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our uverse services were to decide that federal state andor local cable regulation were applicable to our uverse services or if the fcc state agencies or the courts were to rule that we must deliver peg programming in a manner substantially different from the way we do today or in ways that are inconsistent with our current network architecture it could have a material adverse effect on the cost and extent of our uverse offerings 

internet protocol technology ip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice called voice over ip or voip and data using a softwarebased technology rather than a traditional wire and physical switchbased telephone network a company using this technology can provide voice and data services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation using this technology also presents growth opportunities especially in providing data and video services to both fixed locations and mobile devices to take advantage of both these growth and costsavings opportunities we have announced plans to transition wireline customers in our current 22state area to services using this technology by the end of 2020 

business operations 

operating segments 

our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and are managed accordingly we analyze our operating segments based on segment income before income taxes we make our capital allocations decisions based on the strategic needs of the business needs of the network wireless or wireline providing services and demands to provide emerging services to our customers actuarial gains and losses from pension and other postemployment benefits interest expense and other income expense – net are managed only on a total company basis and are accordingly reflected only in consolidated results therefore these items are not included in the calculation of each segment’s reportable results the customers and long lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the united states each segment’s percentage of total segment operating revenue and income calculations is derived from our segment results and income percentage may total more than 100 percent due to losses in one or more segments we have three reportable segments 1 wireless 2 wireline and 3 other

data – wireless data revenues continue to be a growing area of our business representing an increasing share of our overall subscriber revenue we are experiencing solid growth from both consumer and enterprise wireless data services as an increasing number of our subscribers have upgraded their handsets to more advanced integrated devices we are also seeing rapid growth in demand for new datacentric devices such as tablets direction and navigation aids and monitoring devices we recently expanded our mobile share data plans which provide for service on multiple devices at reduced rates to include additional larger usage levels and we have introduced att next a program allowing subscribers to more frequently upgrade handsets using an installment payment plan such offerings are intended to encourage existing subscribers to upgrade their current services andor add connected devices attract subscribers from other providers and minimize subscriber churn participation in these plans continues to increase customers in our “connected device” category eg users of ereaders and navigation aids purchase those devices from thirdparty suppliers that buy data access supported by our network other datacentric device users are classified as either postpaid customers primarily tablet netbook and notebook users or prepaid customers since they purchase service directly from us we continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and applications developers in order to further capitalize on the continued growth in the demand for wireless data services 

voice text and other service –   our voice service is generally offered on a contract basis for one or twoyear periods referred to as postpaid under the terms of these contracts service is billed and provided on a monthly basis according to the applicable rate plan chosen our wireless services include basic local wireless communications service longdistance service and roaming services roaming services enable our subscribers to utilize other carriers’ networks when they are “roaming” outside our network footprint we also charge fees to other carriers for providing roaming services to their customers when their customers utilize our network we also offer prepaid voice service to certain customers who prefer to control usage or pay in advance 

equipment –   we sell a wide variety of handsets wirelessly enabled computers ie tablets and notebooks and personal computer wireless data cards manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services we sell through our own companyowned stores agents or thirdparty retail stores like other wireless service providers we often provide postpaid contract subscribers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate renew or upgrade service to reduce these subsidies we launched our att next program which allows customers to buy handsets on an installment basis as a result of the program we expect equipment revenues to increase in 2014 along with a proportionate decline in service revenues we also sell accessories such as carrying cases handsfree devices batteries battery chargers and other items to consumers as well as to agents and thirdparty distributors for resale 

equity in net income loss of affiliate s –   the wireless segment includes expenses from our mobile payment joint venture with verizon and tmobile marketed as the isis mobile wallet tm isis

wireline 

our wireline subsidiaries provide both retail and wholesale communication services domestically and internationally our wireline segment provided approximately 46 of 2013 segment operating revenues and 27 of our 2013 total segment income we divide our wireline services into three productbased categories data voice and other revenues from our traditional voice services have been declining as customers have been switching to wireless or voip services provided by either us cable or other internetbased providers in addition the continuing weak job growth and business starts have caused wireline customers to terminate their residential or business phone service as individuals have lost jobs or otherwise combined households and businesses have not added jobs we have responded by offering packages of combined voice and data services including broadband and video and intend to continue this strategy during 2014

government regulation 

wireless communications providers must be licensed by the fcc to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the fcc the fcc’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high quality innovative services our customers demand wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically ten years and we must seek renewal of these licenses while the fcc has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the fcc has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest additionally while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states are considering new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services 

on january 14 2014 the dc circuit released its decision on verizon’s appeal of the fcc’s net neutrality rules those rules prohibited providers of fixed mass market internet access service from blocking access to lawful content applications services or nonharmful devices the rules prohibited providers of mobile broadband internet access service from blocking consumers from accessing lawful websites or applications that compete with the provider’s own voice or video telephony services the rules also imposed transparency requirements on providers of both fixed and mobile broadband internet access services requiring public disclosure of information regarding network management practices performance and commercial terms of their service offerings in addition the rules prohibited providers of fixed but not mobile broadband internet access service from unreasonably discriminating in their transmission of lawful network traffic 

in its decision the court found the fcc had authority under section 706 of the act which directs the fcc and state commissions to promote broadband deployment to adopt rules designed to preserve the open internet but vacated and remanded the antidiscrimination and noblocking rules on the ground that they impermissibly imposed common carrier regulation on broadband internet access service the court held that having declared broadband internet access services to be information services the fcc could not regulate them as telecommunications services the court did not vacate the transparency rules 

the invalidation of the noblocking and antidiscrimination rules means that broadband internet access providers have greater flexibility in their provision of mass market services however the court’s finding that section 706 provides the fcc independent authority to adopt rules to promote broadband deployment appears to give the fcc broad authority to regulate the internet and more generally ipbased services provided the fcc finds such regulation promotes deployment of broadband infrastructure in addition because section 706a grants authority to both the fcc and the states to adopt rules to promote broadband deployment states could attempt to rely on that provision to regulate broadband services although the states’ authority to do so appears to be narrower than the fcc’s if the fcc were to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service or the fcc andor the states were to impose additional regulation of the internet or broadband services it could have a material adverse impact on our broadband services and operating results 

    

  

 

our wireline subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services including local longdistance and network access services provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings these subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with respect to intercarrier compensation interconnection and interstate and international rates and services including interstate access charges access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to compensate our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers

history 

att formerly known as sbc communications inc sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corp’s attc local telephone companies on january 1 1984 we were spunoff from attc pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publiclytraded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states our subsidiaries merged with pacific telesis group in 1997 southern new england telecommunications corporation in 1998 and ameritech corporation in 1999 thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec into a total of 13 states in november 2005 one of our subsidiaries merged with attc creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers in connection with the merger we changed the name of our company from “sbc communications inc” to “att inc” in december 2006 one of our subsidiaries merged with bellsouth corporation bellsouth making us the ilec in an additional nine states with the bellsouth acquisition we thereby acquired bellsouth’s 40 percent economic interest in att mobility llc att mobility formerly cingular wireless llc resulting in 100 percent ownership of att mobility our services and products are marketed under the att brand name 

scope 

we are a leading provider of telecommunications services in the united states and the world we offer our services and products to consumers in the us and services and products to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide 

the services and products that we offer vary by market and include wireless communications local exchange services longdistance services databroadband and internet services video services telecommunications equipment managed networking and wholesale services we group our operating subsidiaries as follows corresponding to our operating segments for financial reporting purposes

with the expansion of our company through acquisitions and the resulting ownership consolidation of att mobility and with continuing advances in technology our services offerings now combine our traditional wireline and wireless services we make our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2013 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below 

wireless 

att mobility began operations in october 2000 as a joint venture between us and bellsouth and in 2004 acquired att wireless services inc upon our acquisition of bellsouth in 2006 att mobility became a whollyowned subsidiary as of december 31 2012 we served 107 million subscribers 

we cover most major metropolitan areas of the united states with our universal mobile telecommunications systemhighspeed downlink packet access hspa and hspa network technology with hspa providing 4g speeds when combined with our upgraded backhaul at the end of 2012 over 90 percent of our data traffic was carried over this enhanced backhaul our network provides superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services as well as operating efficiencies using the same spectrum and infrastructure for voice and data on an ipbased platform our wireless network also relies on digital transmission technologies known as gsm general packet radio services and enhanced data rates for gsm evolution edge for data communications we have also begun transitioning our network to next generation lte technology and expect this network to cover approximately 300 million people in the united states and to be largely complete by the end of 2014 we continue to expand the number of locations including airports and cafés where customers can access broadband internet connections using wireless fidelity local radio frequency commonly referred to as wifi technology 

as the wireless industry continues to mature we believe that future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services and a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations and make them available to more subscribers we are facing significant spectrum and capacity constraints on our wireless network in certain markets we expect such constraints to increase and expand to additional markets in the coming years while we are continuing to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity our capacity constraints could affect the quality of existing voice and data services and our ability to launch new advanced wireless broadband services unless we are able to obtain more spectrum any longterm spectrum solution will require that the fcc make new or existing spectrum available to the wireless industry to meet the expanding needs of our subscribers we will continue to attempt to address spectrum and capacity constraints on a marketbymarket basis to that end we signed nearly 50 deals to acquire spectrum during 2012 some pending regulatory review much of the recently acquired spectrum came from an innovative solution in which we obtained fcc approval to use wcs spectrum for mobile broadband for the first time 

also as part of our efforts to improve our network performance and help address the need for additional spectrum capacity we intend to redeploy spectrum currently used for basic 2g services to support more advanced mobile internet services on our 3g and 4g networks we will manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades and will transition customers on a marketbymarket basis from our global system for mobile communications gsm and edge networks referred to as 2g networks to our more advanced 3g and 4g networks we expect to fully discontinue service on our 2g networks by approximately january 1 2017 as of december 31 2012 about 8 percent of att’s postpaid subscribers used 2gcapable handsets we do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our operating results 

business customers 

we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both wireless and wireline to large businesses governmental and wholesale customers worldwide we expect to offer similar services to small and mediumbusinesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers we also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services 

databroadband 

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on expanding our att uverse highspeed broadband and video offerings and on developing ipbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service 

 

 

  

  

 

uverse services during 2012 we continued to expand our offerings of uverse high speed internet and tv services as of december 31 2012 we are marketing uverse services to approximately 245 million customer locations locations eligible to receive uverse service as of december 31 2012 we had 80 million total uverse subscribers highspeed internet and video including 77 million internet and 45 million video subscribers subscribers to both services are only counted once in the total as part of project velocity ip vip we plan to expand our uverse services to an additional approximately 85 million customer locations 

we believe that our uverse tv service is a “video service” under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation certain municipalities have delayed our requests to offer this service or have refused us permission to use our existing or new rightofways to deploy or activate our uverserelated equipment services and products resulting in litigation petitions have been filed at the fcc alleging that the manner in which we provision “public educational and governmental” peg programming over our uverse tv service conflicts with federal law and a lawsuit has been filed in a california state superior court raising similar allegations under california law if courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our uverse services were to decide that federal state andor local cable regulation were applicable to our uverse services or if the fcc state agencies or the courts were to rule that we must deliver peg programming in a manner substantially different from the way we do today or in ways that are inconsistent with our current network architecture it could have a material adverse effect on the cost and extent of our uverse offerings 

voice over internet protocol voip voip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using ipbased technology rather than a traditional wire and switchbased telephone network a company using this technology can often provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation while the development of voip has resulted in increased competition for our wireless and wireline voice services it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers 

project vip in november 2012 we announced plans to significantly expand and enhance our wireless and wireline broadband networks to support future ip data growth and new services as part of project vip we plan to expand our deployment of lte wireless technology and deploy additional technology to further improve wireless spectrum efficiencies to that end we expect to cover at least 250 million people in the united states by yearend 2013 and approximately 300 million people in the united states by the end of 2014 in addition we plan to expand our wireline ip broadband network to additional residential and smallbusiness customer locations to cover approximately 75 percent of all such customer locations in our 22state wireline service area by yearend 2015 this project is intended to support new revenue opportunities in four key areas wireless strategic network services network managed “cloud” services and security as well as continued growth in existing wireless uverse and iprelated business services we expect capital expenditures in the 21 billion range for 2013 and 2014 and 2015 to each be approximately 22 billion and then decrease to preproject vip levels

history 

att formerly known as sbc communications inc sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corp’s attc local telephone companies on january 1 1984 we were spunoff from attc pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states our subsidiaries merged with pacific telesis group in 1997 southern new england telecommunications corporation in 1998 and ameritech corporation in 1999 thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec into a total of 13 states in november 2005 one of our subsidiaries merged with attc creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers in connection with the merger we changed the name of our company from “sbc communications inc” to “att inc” in december 2006 one of our subsidiaries merged with bellsouth corporation bellsouth making us the ilec in an additional nine states with the bellsouth acquisition we thereby acquired bellsouth’s 40 economic interest in att mobility llc att mobility formerly cingular wireless llc and bellsouth’s 34 economic interest in yellowpagescom ypc resulting in 100 ownership of att mobility and ypc our services and products are marketed under the att brand name including alliances such as att yahoo and att  direct tv 

scope 

we are a leading provider of telecommunications services in the united states and the world we offer our services and products to consumers in the us and services and products to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide 

the services and products that we offer vary by market and include wireless communications local exchange services longdistance services databroadband and internet services video services telecommunications equipment managed networking wholesale services and directory advertising and publishing we group our operating subsidiaries as follows corresponding to our operating segments for financial reporting purposes 

 

 

 

 

our local exchange subsidiaries operate as the ilec in 22 states alabama arkansas california connecticut illinois indiana florida georgia kentucky louisiana kansas michigan mississippi missouri nevada north carolina ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas and wisconsin 22state area our local exchange subsidiaries are subject to regulation by each state in which they operate and by the federal communications commission fcc wireless service providers are regulated by the fcc additional information relating to regulation is contained under the heading “government regulation” and in the annual report under the heading “operating environment and trends of the business” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

  

  

  

 

  

 

with the expansion of our company through acquisitions and the resulting ownership consolidation of att mobility and with continuing advances in technology our services offerings now combine our traditional wireline and wireless services we make our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2012 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below 

wireless 

att mobility began operations in october 2000 as a joint venture between us and bellsouth and in 2004 acquired att wireless services inc upon our acquisition of bellsouth in 2006 att mobility became a whollyowned subsidiary 

we cover most major metropolitan areas of the united states with our universal mobile telecommunications systemhighspeed downlink packet access hspa and hspa network technology with hspa providing 4g speeds when combined with our upgraded backhaul at the end of 2011 over 80 of our data traffic was carried over this enhanced backhaul our network provides superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services as well as operating efficiencies using the same spectrum and infrastructure for voice and data on an ipbased platform our wireless network also relies on digital transmission technologies known as gsm general packet radio services and enhanced data rates for gsm evolution for data communications as of december 31 2011 we served 103 million subscribers we have also begun transitioning our network to next generation lte technology and expect this network to cover approximately 80 of the us population and to be largely complete by the end of 2013 we continue to expand the number of locations including airports and cafés where customers can access broadband internet connections using wireless fidelity local radio frequency commonly referred to as wifi wireless technology 

as the wireless industry continues to mature we believe that future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services to customers which in turn will depend on the availability of additional spectrum we are facing significant spectrum and capacity constraints on our wireless network in certain markets we expect such constraints to increase and expand to additional markets in the coming years while we are continuing to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity our capacity constraints could affect the quality of existing voice and data services and our ability to launch new advanced wireless broadband services unless we are able to obtain more spectrum any spectrum solution will require that the fcc makes new spectrum available to the wireless industry and allows us to obtain the spectrum we need more immediately to meet the needs of our customers we will continue to attempt to address spectrum and capacity constraints on a marketbymarket basis 

business customers 

we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both wireless and wireline to large businesses and wholesale customers worldwide we expect to offer similar services to small and mediumbusinesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers we also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services 

databroadband 

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on expanding our att uverse highspeed broadband and video offerings and on developing ipbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service 

uverse services during 2011 we continued to expand our offerings of uverse high speed internet and tv services 

as of december 31 2011 we reached our deployment goal of 30 million living units and have now passed 303 million living units constructed housing units as well as platted housing lots we are marketing uverse services to 78 of those units and had 38 million subscribers by yearend 2011 during 2012 we will continue our efforts to increase sales to this base 

we believe that our uverse tv service is a “video service” under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation certain municipalities have delayed our requests to offer this service or have refused us permission to use our existing or new rightofways to deploy or activate our uverserelated equipment services and products resulting in litigation petitions have been filed at the fcc alleging that the manner in which we provision “public educational and governmental” peg programming over our uverse tv service conflicts with federal law and a lawsuit has been filed in a california state superior court raising similar allegations under california law if courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our uverse services were to decide that federal state andor local cable regulation were applicable to our uverse services or if the fcc state agencies or the courts were to rule that we must deliver peg programming in a manner substantially different from the way we do today or in ways that are inconsistent with our current network architecture it could have a material adverse effect on the cost and extent of our uverse offerings 

 

  

  

  

 

 

 

voice over internet protocol voip voip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using ipbased technology rather than a traditional wire and switchbased telephone network a company using this technology can often provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation while the development of voip has resulted in increased competition for our wireless and wireline voice services it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers

with the expansion of our company through acquisitions and the resulting ownership consolidation of att mobility and with continuing advances in technology our services offerings now combine our traditional wireline and wireless services we make our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2011 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below 

wireless 

att mobility began operations in october 2000 as a joint venture between us and bellsouth and in 2004 acquired att wireless services inc upon our acquisition of bellsouth in 2006 att mobility became a whollyowned subsidiary 

we cover most major metropolitan areas of the us with our universal mobile telecommunications system highspeed downlink packet access hspa and hspa network technology with hspa providing 4g speeds when combined with our upgraded backhaul our network provides superior speeds for data and video services as well as operating efficiencies using the same spectrum and infrastructure for voice and data on an ipbased platform our wireless network also relies on digital transmission technologies known as global system for mobile communication general packet radio services and enhanced data rates for gsm evolution for data communications we have also begun transitioning our network to more advanced longterm evolution lte technology we continue to expand the number of locations including airports and cafés where customers can access broadband internet connections using wireless fidelity local radio frequency commonly referred as wifi wireless technology 

as of december 31 2010 we served 955 million wireless customers and were a leading provider of mobile wireless voice and data communications services in the us as the wireless industry continues to mature our future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer integrated handsets and other innovative devices such as tablets and ereaders and innovative services that will encourage existing customers to upgrade their services and will attract customers from other providers as well as on our ability to minimize turnover of our existing customer base customer churn we intend to accomplish these goals by continuing to expand our network coverage and improve our network quality and expand our mobile device offerings our ability to maintain and expand network service enhancements and product launches may not occur as scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors including delays in determining equipment and handset operating standards supplier delays increases in network equipment and handset component costs regulatory permitting delays for tower sites or enhancements or laborrelated delays the effective management of customer churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve our operating margins 

business customers 

we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both wireless and wireline to large businesses and wholesale customers worldwide we expect to offer similar services to small and mediumbusinesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers we also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services 

databroadband 

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on deploying our att uverse sm highspeed broadband and video services and on developing internet protocolbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service 

uverse services we are continuing to expand our deployment of uverse high speed internet and tv services as of december 31 2010 we have passed more than 273 million living units constructed housing units as well as platted housing lots and are marketing the services to almost 77 percent of those units our rate of expansion will be slowed if we cannot obtain all required local building permits in a timely fashion we also continue to work with our vendors on improving in a timely manner the requisite hardware and software technology our deployment plans could be delayed if we do not receive required equipment and software on schedule 

we believe that our uverse tv service is subject to federal oversight as a “video service” under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation certain municipalities have delayed our request or have refused us permission to use our existing rightofways to deploy or activate our uverserelated services and products resulting in litigation pending negotiations and current or threatened litigation involving municipalities could delay our deployment plans in those areas petitions have been filed at the fcc alleging that the manner in which att provisions “public educational and governmental” peg programming over its uverse tv service conflicts with federal law and a lawsuit has been filed in a california state superior court raising similar allegations under california law if courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our uverse services were to decide that federal state andor local cable regulation were applicable to our uverse services or if the fcc state agencies or the courts were to rule that att must deliver peg programming in a manner substantially different from the way it does today or in ways that are inconsistent with att’s current network architecture it could have a material adverse effect on the cost timing and extent of our deployment plans 

  

  

 

voice over internet protocol voip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using internetprotocolbased technology rather than a traditional wire and switchbased telephone network a company using this technology often can provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation while the development of voip has resulted in increased competition for our wireless and wireline voice services it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers

att formerly known as sbc communications inc sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corp’s attc local telephone companies on january 1 1984 we were spunoff from attc pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states our subsidiaries merged with pacific telesis group in 1997 southern new england telecommunications corporation in 1998 and ameritech corporation in 1999 thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier ilec into a total of 13 states in november 2005 one of our subsidiaries merged with attc creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers in connection with the merger we changed the name of our company from “sbc communications inc” to “att inc” in december 2006 one of our subsidiaries merged with bellsouth corporation bellsouth making us the ilec in an additional nine states with the bellsouth acquisition we thereby acquired bellsouth’s 40 economic interest in att mobility llc att mobility formerly cingular wireless llc and bellsouth’s 34 economic interest in yellowpagescom ypc resulting in 100 ownership of att mobility and ypc our services and products are marketed under the att brand name including alliances such as att yahoo and att  direct tv 

scope 

we rank among the leading providers of telecommunications services in the united states and the world we offer our services and products to consumers in the us and services and products to businesses and other providers of telecommunications services worldwide

with the expansion of our company through acquisitions and the resulting ownership consolidation of att mobility and with continuing advances in technology we plan to offer new services that combine our traditional wireline and wireless services thereby making our customers’ lives more convenient and productive and fostering competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry in 2010 we plan to focus on the areas discussed below 

wireless 

att mobility began operations in october 2000 as a joint venture between us and bellsouth and in 2004 acquired att wireless services inc upon our acquisition of bellsouth att mobility became a whollyowned subsidiary 

our universal mobile telecommunications system highspeed downlink packet access third generation 3g network technology covers most major metropolitan areas of the us this technology provides superior speeds for data and video services as well as operating efficiencies using the same spectrum and infrastructure for voice and data on an ipbased platform our wireless network also relies on digital transmission technologies known as global system for mobile communication general packet radio services and enhanced data rates for gsm evolution for data communications we have also announced plans to transition our network to more advanced long term evolution technology in 2011 as network equipment and handsets are expected to become widely available we also have continued to expand the number of locations including airports and cafes where customers can access broadband internet connections using wireless fidelity local radio frequency commonly referred as wifi wireless technology 

as of december 31 2009 we served 851 million customers and were a leading provider of mobile wireless voice and data communications services in the us as the wireless industry continues to mature we believe that future wireless growth will become increasingly dependent on our ability to offer integrated handsets and other innovative devices such as netbooks and ereaders and innovative services that will encourage existing customers to upgrade their services and will attract customers from other providers as well as our ability to minimize turnover of our existing customer base customer churn we intend to accomplish these goals by continuing to expand our network coverage improve our network quality and offer a broad array of products and services including exclusive devices such as apple iphone wifi enabled devices and free mobiletomobile calling among our wireless customers the effective management of customer churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve our operating margins 

business customers 

we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both wireless and wireline to large businesses and wholesale customers worldwide we expect to offer similar services to small and mediumbusinesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers we also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services 

databroadband 

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services that take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on deploying our att uverse sm highspeed broadband and video services and on developing internet protocolbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service 

uverse services we are continuing to expand our deployment of our uverse services in december 2009 we added our two millionth uverse video customer ending the year with approximately 2065000 customers as of december 31 2009 we passed 228 million living units constructed housing units as well as platted housing lots and are marketing the services to almost 72 percent of those units our deployment strategy is to enter each new area on a limited basis in order to ensure that all operating and backoffice systems are functioning successfully and then expand within each area as we continue to monitor these systems our rate of expansion will be slowed if we cannot obtain all required local building permits in a timely fashion we also continue to work with our vendors on improving in a timely manner the requisite hardware and software technology our deployment plans could be delayed if we do not receive required equipment and software on schedule 

we believe that our uverse tv service is subject to federal oversight as a “video service” under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation certain municipalities have delayed our request or have refused us permission to use our existing rightofways to deploy or activate our uverserelated services and products resulting in litigation pending negotiations and current or threatened litigation involving municipalities could delay our deployment plans in those areas in july 2008 the us district court for connecticut affirmed its october 2007 ruling that att’s uverse tv service is a cable service in connecticut we have appealed that decision on the basis that state legislation rendered the case moot petitions have been filed at the fcc alleging that the manner in which att provisions “public educational and governmental” peg programming over its uverse tv service conflicts with federal law and a lawsuit has been filed in a california state superior court raising similar allegations under california law if the courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our uverse services were to decide that federal state andor local cable regulation were applicable to our uverse services or if the fcc state agencies or the courts were to rule that att must deliver peg programming in a manner substantially different from the way it does today or in ways that are inconsistent with att’s current network architecture it could have a material adverse effect on the cost timing and extent of our deployment plans 

 

 

  

  

 

voice over internet protocol voip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using internetprotocolbased technology rather than a traditional wire and switchbased telephone network a company using this technology often can provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation while the development of voip has resulted in increased competition for our wireless and wireline voice services it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers

as the wireless industry continues to mature we believe that future wireless growth will become increasingly dependent on our ability to offer innovative services that will encourage existing customers to upgrade their services and will attract customers from other providers as well as our ability to minimize turnover of our existing customer base customer churn we intend to accomplish these goals by continuing to expand our network coverage improve our network quality and offer a broad array of products and services including exclusive devices such as the apple iphone and free mobiletomobile calling among our wireless customers the effective management of customer churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve our operating margins 

business customers 

as we continue to integrate the operations of bellsouth and attc we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both wireless and wireline to large businesses and wholesale customers worldwide we expect to offer similar services to small and mediumbusinesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers we also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services 

databroadband 

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services to take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on deploying our att uverse sm highspeed broadband and tv services and on developing internet protocolbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service 

uverse services we are continuing to expand our deployment of our uverse services in december 2008 we added our millionth uverse video customer ending the year with approximately 1045000 customers as of december 31 2008 we have passed approximately 17 million living units constructed housing units as well as platted housing lots and are marketing the services to almost 65 percent of those units our deployment strategy is to enter each new area on a limited basis in order to ensure that all operating and backoffice systems are functioning successfully and then expand within each area as we continue to monitor these systems in these expansions we expect to continue to use contracted outside labor in addition to our employees as installers our rate of expansion will be slowed if we cannot hire and train an adequate number of qualified contractors and technicians to keep pace with customer demand or if we cannot obtain all required local building permits in a timely fashion we also continue to work with our vendors on improving in a timely manner the requisite hardware and software technology our deployment plans could be delayed if we do not receive required equipment and software on schedule 

we believe that our uverse tv service is subject to federal oversight as a “video service” under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation certain municipalities have delayed our request or have refused us permission to use our existing rightofways to deploy or activate our uverserelated services and products resulting in litigation pending negotiations and current or threatened litigation involving municipalities could delay our deployment plans in those areas in july 2008 the us district court for connecticut affirmed its october 2007 ruling that att’s uverse tv service is a cable service in connecticut we have appealed that decision on the basis that state legislation rendered the case moot if the courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our uverse services were to decide that federal state andor local cable regulation were applicable to our uverse services it could have a material adverse effect on the cost timing and extent of our deployment plans 

 

  

  

 

voice over internet protocol voip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using internetprotocolbased technology rather than a traditional wire and switchbased telephone network a company using this technology often can provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation while the development of voip has resulted in increased competition for our wireline voice services it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers

as the wireless industry continues to mature we believe that future wireless growth will become increasingly dependent on our ability to offer innovative services that will encourage existing customers to upgrade their services and will attract customers from other providers as well as our ability to minimize turnover of our existing customer base customer churn we intend to accomplish these goals by continuing to expand our network coverage improve our network quality and offer a broad array of products and services including exclusive devices such as the apple iphone and free mobiletomobile calling among our wireless customers the effective management of customer churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve our operating margins 

business customers 

as we continue to integrate the operations of bellsouth and attc we expect to continue to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of communications services both wireless and wireline to large businesses and wholesale customers worldwide we expect to offer similar services to small and mediumbusinesses and to increase the attractiveness of our services to governmental customers we also expect to extend our wholesale business offerings to other service products and systems integration services 

databroadband 

as the communications industry continues to move toward internetbased technologies that are capable of blending traditional wireline and wireless services we plan to offer services to take advantage of these new and more sophisticated technologies in particular we intend to continue to focus on deploying our att uverse sm highspeed broadband and tv services and on developing internet protocolbased services that allow customers to unite their home or business wireline services with their wireless service 

uverse services we are continuing to expand our deployment of our uverse services as of december 31 2007 we have passed approximately 8 million living units constructed housing units as well as platted housing lots and are marketing the services to almost 50 percent of those units our deployment strategy is to enter each market on a limited basis in order to ensure that all operating and backoffice systems are functioning successfully and then expand within each market as we continue to monitor these systems in these market expansions we expect to continue to use contracted outside labor in addition to our employees as installers our rate of expansion will be slowed if we cannot hire and train an adequate number of qualified contractors and technicians to keep pace with customer demand or if we cannot obtain all required local permits in a timely fashion we also continue to work with our vendors on improving in a timely manner the requisite hardware and software technology our deployment plans could be delayed if we do not receive required equipment and software on schedule see our “liquidity” discussion for an update on our uverse capital spending 

we believe that our uverse tv service is subject to federal oversight as a “video service” under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local cable regulation if the courts having jurisdiction where we have significant deployments of our uverse services were to decide that federal state andor local cable regulation were applicable to our uverse services it could have a material adverse effect on the cost timing and extent of our deployment plans

voice over internet protocol voip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using internetprotocolbased technology rather than a traditional wire and switchbased telephone network a company using this technology often can provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation while the development of voip has resulted in increased competition for our wireline voice services it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers

uverse services project lightspeed in june 2004 we announced key advances in developing a network capable of delivering a new generation of integrated digital television highspeed broadband and voice over internet protocol voip services to our residential and smallbusiness customers we have been building out this network in numerous locations and are now providing att uverse sm services including uverse tv iptv video in limited parts of 11 markets as of yearend 2006 and expect to launch additional markets during 2007 our deployment strategy is to enter each market on a limited basis in order to ensure that all operating and backoffice systems are functioning successfully and then expand within each market as we continue to monitor these systems to ensure customer satisfaction with our services in these market expansions we expect to continue to use contracted outside labor in addition to our employees as installers our rate of expansion will be slowed if we cannot hire and train an adequate number of technicians to keep pace with customer demand during our launch into these additional markets we also expect to add additional features to our ip video service offering we expect to have the capability to offer service to approximately 19 million living units by the end of 2008 as part of our initial deployment and expect to spend approximately 4600 in networkrelated deployment costs and capital expenditures from 2006 through 2008 as well as additional customer activation capital expenditures we remain on budget for this overall target and expect to spend approximately 3100 during 2007 and 2008 these expenditures may increase slightly if the programming and features of the video offering expand or if additional network conditioning is required 

  

with respect to our ip video service we continue to work with our vendors to continue to improve in a timely manner the requisite hardware and software technology our deployment plans could be delayed if we do not receive required equipment and software on schedule we have completed most negotiations and consistent with our profitability assumptions with programming owners eg movie studios and cable networks to offer existing television programs and movies and if applicable other new interactive services also as discussed in the “regulatory developments” section we are supporting legislation at the state level that would streamline the regulatory process for new video competitors to enter the market 

  

we believe that iptv is subject to federal oversight as a “video service” under the federal communications act however some cable providers and municipalities have claimed that certain ip services should be treated as a traditional cable service and therefore subject to the applicable state and local regulation which could include the requirement to pay fees to obtain local franchises for our ip video service certain municipalities have refused us permission to use our existing rightofways to deploy or activate our uverserelated services and products resulting in litigation pending negotiations and current or threatened litigation involving municipalities could delay our deployment plans in those areas for 2007 and future years if the courts were to decide that state and local regulation were applicable to our uverse services it could have a material adverse effect on the cost timing and extent of our deployment plans 

  

additional information about project lightspeed is included in our “operating environment and trends of the business” section under the heading “expected growth areas” on page 31 of the 2006 att annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

  

voice over internet protocol voip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using internetprotocolbased technology rather than a traditional wire and switchbased telephone network a company using this technology often can provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation but depending on the bandwidth allocated voip services may not necessarily be of the same quality as traditional telephone service the fcc has ongoing proceedings that will address various regulatory issues including universal service intercarrier compensation numbering disability access and consumer protection 

  

   

  

notwithstanding the unresolved regulatory questions before the fcc and various state public utility commissions numerous communications providers have begun providing various forms of voip or announced their intentions to do so in the near future these providers include both established companies as well as new entrants thus while the deployment of voip will result in increased competition for our voice services it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers additional information relating to voip is contained in the 2006 att annual report to stockholders in our “regulatory developments” section under the heading “voice over internet protocol” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2

we provide telecommunications services throughout the us and internationally our traditional wireline subsidiaries operate in thirteen states arkansas california connecticut illinois indiana kansas michigan missouri nevada ohio oklahoma texas and wisconsin 13state area wireline local exchange services offered in our 13state area are provided through regulated subsidiaries which operate within authorized regions subject to regulation by each state in which they operate and by the federal communications commission fcc subsidiaries of our att corp segment provide services both domestically and internationally with domestic services subject to regulation by various states and the fcc additional information relating to regulation is contained under the heading “government regulation” below and in the 2005 att annual report to stockholders under the heading “operating environment and trends of the business” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

  

our acquisition of attc will help change the focus of our company towards business and broadbanddata revenues cingular’s late 2004 acquisition of att wireless services inc att wireless also increased our potential for growth in the wireless area discussed below are the factors upon which we are focusing in 2006 

  

business markets 

with the acquisition of attc we expect to strengthen the reach and sophistication of our network facilities and our ability to offer a variety of global communications services to large businesses worldwide we expect significant opportunity in the small and medium business markets and to increase our governmental and largebusiness referred to as “enterprise” customer base we also expect to extend our wholesale business to other service products and systems integrations 

  

databroadband 

project lightspeed in june 2004 we announced key advances in developing a network capable of delivering a new generation of integrated digital television superhighspeed broadband and voice over internet protocol voip services to our residential and small business customers referred to as project lightspeed we have been building out this network in numerous locations and began providing services in one limited market including internet protocol ip video in late 2005 our goal in this controlled initial launch is to ensure all operating and backoffice systems function at a level capable of supporting our targeted mid2006 scaledup deployment to that end we have restricted the number of customers and services offered to the necessary minimum subject to successful results from this controlled launch and successful testing of our additional ip video services we plan to enter additional markets in mid2006 at that time we expect to add additional services and features to our service offerings we expect to have the capability to offer service to approximately 18 million households by the end of 2008 as part of our initial deployment and expect to spend approximately 44 billion in network related deployment costs and capital expenditures beginning in 2006 through 2008 as well as additional successbased customer activation capital expenditures 

  

with respect to our ip video service marketed under att uverse tv we continue to work with our vendors to develop in a timely manner the requisite hardware and software technology our deployment plans could be delayed if we do not receive the required equipment and software on schedule we also continue to negotiate with programming owners eg movie studios and cable networks for permission to offer existing television programs and movies and if applicable other new interactive services we could offer in the future using advances in the ip technology we are testing our ability to provide an attractive and profitable video offering will depend in large part on the results of these efforts we are supporting legislation at both the federal and 

  

  

   

  

state levels that would streamline the regulatory process for new video competitors to enter the market if the legislation or regulatory outcomes are not as we expect it could have a material adverse effect on the cost timing and extent of our deployment plans additional information about project lightspeed is included in our “operating environment and trends of the business” section under the heading “expected growth areas” on page 34 of the 2005 att annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

  

voice over internet protocol voip is generally used to describe the transmission of voice using internetprotocolbased technology rather than a traditional wire and switchbased telephone network a company using this technology often can provide voice services at a lower cost because this technology uses bandwidth more efficiently than a traditional network and because this technology has not been subject to traditional telephone industry regulation but depending on the bandwidth allocated voip services may not necessarily be of the same quality as traditional telephone service in early 2004 the fcc opened a proceeding to establish the regulatory framework for ipenabled services including voip in this ongoing proceeding the fcc will address various regulatory issues including universal service intercarrier compensation numbering disability access consumer protection and customer access to 911 emergency services 

  

notwithstanding the unresolved regulatory questions before the fcc and various state public utility commissions numerous communications providers have begun providing various forms of voip or announced their intentions to do so in the near future these providers include both established companies as well as new entrants thus while the deployment of voip will result in increased competition for our voice services it also presents growth opportunities for us to develop new products for our customers additional information relating to voip is contained in the 2005 att annual report to stockholders in our “regulatory developments” section under the heading “voice over internet protocol” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2

when analyzing our segment results we evaluate cingular’s results on a standalone basis using information provided by cingular during the year our consolidated operating revenues do not include cingular’s results however we do include 100 of cingular’s revenues and expenses excluding this adjustment when we analyze our operating segment results on that segment basis the cingular segment provided approximately 44 of total segment operating revenues and 7 of our 2005 total segment income

consortium that holds all of the class aa shares of telmex stock representing voting control of the company another member of the consortium carso global telecom sa de cv has the right to appoint a majority of the directors of telmex

major classes of service 

  

the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated total reported operating revenues by any class of service that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated total operating revenues in any of the last three fiscal years our att corp segment is included below because it provides similar services to our wireline segment’s services 

  

 1 approximately 96 96 and 95 of directory advertising revenues were recorded in the directory segment for 2005 2004 and 2003 the remaining directory advertising revenues were recorded in the wireline segment 

  

our cingular segment revenues are reported in equity in net income of affiliates in our consolidated financial statements due to our equity accounting for the joint venture directory advertising revenues are included in our directory segment’s results of operations and are approximately 98 of directory’s total operating revenues 

  

we account for our 60 economic interest in cingular under the equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements since we share control equally ie 5050 with our 40 economic partner in the joint venture we have equal voting rights and representation on the board of directors that controls cingular this means that our consolidated reported results include cingular’s results in the “equity in net income of affiliates” line we do not report cingular revenues on our consolidated financial statements however when analyzing our segment results we evaluate cingular’s results on a standalone basis the table below shows the effect on our other classes of services shown in the above table if we include 100 of cingular’s revenues added to our total segment operating revenues 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 directory advertising contributes less than 10 of total segment operating revenues when we include 100 of cingular in the calculation

what factors have been shaping our industry

     we compete in the communications services industry the communications
services industry continues to evolve both domestically and internationally
providing significant opportunities and risks to the participants in these
markets factors that have been driving this change include

      entry of new competitors and investment of substantial capital in
       existing and new services resulting in significant price competition

      consolidation of existing industry participants

      technological advances resulting in a proliferation of new services and
       products and rapid increases in network capacity

      the telecommunications act of 1996 telecommunications act and

      growing deregulation of communications services markets in the united
       states and in selected countries around the world

     one factor affecting the communications services industry is the rapid
development of data and ip services the development of frame relay atm and ip
networks as modes of transmitting information electronically has dramatically
transformed the array and breadth of services offered by telecommunications
carriers

     in the us the telecommunications act has had a significant impact on our
business in 20032005 actions have been taken by the federal courts and the
federal communications commission fcc relating to the telecommunications act
which are materially adverse to our ability to compete with respect to mass
market local and long distance services see more detailed discussion under the
topic what legislative and regulatory developments are important to us
below in addition prices for long distance minutes and other basic
communications services have declined as a result of competitive pressures
excess network capacity the introduction of more efficient networks and
advanced technologies product substitution and deregulation for example
consumer long distance voice usage is declining as a result of substitution to
wireless services internet access and emailinstant messaging services
particularly in the dial one long distance card and operator services
segments

     the long distance market is characterized by rapid deregulation and intense
competition among long distance providers and more recently incumbent local
exchange carriers under the telecommunications act a regional phone company
may offer long distance services in a state within its region if the fcc finds
first that the regional phone companys service territory within the state has
been sufficiently opened to local competition and second that allowing the
regional phone company to provide these services is in the public interest by
december 2003 regional phone companies had received approval to offer long
distance in all states within their regions the incumbent local exchange
carriers presently have numerous competitive advantages as a result of their
strong local exchange assets

     we had entered the local voice business for residential customers large
business customers and small to medium sized customers in a significant number
of states by the middle of 2004 when we announced we would no longer be
investing to acquire new mass market local customers our ability to remain in
our current local mass market voice markets has been materially and adversely
affected by the recent judicial and regulatory developments

how has our business developed and what is our strategy

     for the past five years our traditional long distance services have
experienced an industrywide trend of lower revenue from lower prices email
and wireless substitution and increased competition in addition economic
conditions have been generally adverse for significant new telecommunications
spending by our customers we had evolved several strategies to combat this
challenging environment we have sought to reduce costs and increase operating
efficiency we have emphasized our other service offerings such as consumer and
business local services and have bundled them with our long distance services
we have tried to

                                        2
page

add value to our services by investing in innovation expertise customer care
and network integration we have sought to capitalize on new technology most
recently with our development of voice over internet protocol services and we
have prudently limited our capital expenditures while reducing our debt
however on july 22 2004 we announced that as a result of recent changes in
regulatory policy governing local telephone service we would be shifting our
focus away from traditional consumer services and we would no longer be
investing to acquire new residential local and standalone long distance
customers going forward we plan to concentrate our investments on business
markets and emerging technologies

what is our domestic us network

     our us network is comprised of 55543 route miles of longhaul backbone
fiber optic cable plus 21655 additional route miles of local metropolitan
fiber capable of carrying high speed 10 billion bits or 10 gigabits per
second traffic att business services has expanded this fiber network
recently completing the installation of 14838 new route miles of the latest
generation fiber optic cable capable of carrying 40 gigabits per second when
that technology is commercially available this new fiber capacity provides
substantial capacity for potential future growth of network traffic with low
incremental capital expenditure requirements in addition we also have 692
pointsofpresence in the continental us with the majority served by high
speed fiberbased technology offering high speed data connectivity to the
majority of us business centers

     on an average business day our business network which also supports
consumer services handles a total of 364 million voice calls as well as 4411
trillion bytes terabytes of data on the voice network we employ our patented
real time network routing to automatically complete domestic voice calls through
more than 100 possible routes the reliability of certain portions of the
network is maximized by using synchronous optical network sonet rings that can
restore service following a network failure within 50 to 60 milliseconds by
reversing the flow of traffic on the ring on other routes we use our patented
fastarr

technology to route traffic around a fiber optic cable cut using spare transport
capacity elsewhere on the network most recently we have deployed intelligent
optical switches across the network to expand our ability to rapidly and
automatically restore network traffic that might be otherwise affected by a
cable cut or equipment failure

     we have been deploying dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm
technology that divides the signal carried by an optical fiber into multiple
wavelengths each now carrying up to 10 gigabits per second of information when
dwdm was introduced in 1996 the technology could transmit only eight different
wavelengths on a fiber strand we are currently deploying 64and 80wavelength
dwdm systems as well as systems capable of carrying 160 wavelengths

     since digital switching was introduced in the late 1970s the basic element
of our long distance voice network has been a circuit switch which was
specifically designed for longhaul use currently we employ 138 of these
switches in our network we have recently installed 68 of the latest high
performance carriergrade voice switches that allow us to accommodate the
transition from circuitswitched to packet networks in addition in support of

by the centers ranges from universal service to specialized services based on
functional area or customer needs in addition over 10 languages are supported
within our customer care and service functions and access to over 120 languages
is available through outsourced vendors

how do we charge for our services

     we generally continue to charge long distance customers for
jurisdictionally intrastate services based on applicable tariffs filed with
various individual states rates for statetostate and international calls are
now generally set by contract rather than by fcc tariffs as a result of an fcc
detariffing order customers select different services and various rate plans
which determine the monthly or per minute price that customers pay on their long
distance calls per minute rates typically vary based on a variety of factors
particularly the volume of usage and the day and time that calls are made

     our long distance charges may include fees per minute for transporting a
call per call or per minute surcharges monthly recurring charges minimums and
price structures that offer a fixed number of minutes each month for a specific
price and price structure that offer unlimited calling to certain numbers for
particular time periods or for the entire month for a monthly fee the fees per
minute for transporting a call may vary by time of day or length of call and by
whether the call is domestic or international within the us instate rates
may vary from interstate rates these rate structures apply to customer dialed
calls calling card calls directory assistance calls operatorassisted calls
and certain miscellaneous services customers also may be assessed a percentage
of revenue or a fixed monthly fee to satisfy our obligations to recover us
federal and statemandated assessments and access surcharges additional fees
may also be assessed to help recover specific costs of providing service to
consumers examples of these fees include the att regulatory assessment fee
which helps recover costs associated with statetostate and international
connection charges property taxes and the expenses associated with regulatory
proceedings and compliance and the instate connection fee which recovers
costs charged by local telephone companies to carry our instate long distance
calls over their lines

     customers for combined long distance and local services are usually charged
a flat rate per month for local service and a separate monthly rate for each
additional feature not included in the local service option selected by the
customer usage fees andor monthly charges are charged for long distance att
worldnet service offers a variety of pricing plan options generally customers
are charged a flat rate for a certain number of hours with charges for each
additional hour of usage att worldnet service also offers a plan

what legislative and regulatory developments are important to us

     telecommunications act of 1996  the telecommunications act became law on
february 8 1996 among other things the telecommunications act was designed to
foster local exchange competition by establishing a regulatory framework to
govern new competitive entry in local and long distance telecommunications
services

     in august 1996 the fcc adopted rules and regulations including pricing
rules to implement the local competition provisions of the telecommunications
act these rules and regulations rely on state public utility commissions pucs
to develop the specific rates and procedures applicable to particular states
within the framework prescribed by the fcc during the ensuing seven years the
interpretation of the telecommunications acts provisions and the validity of
the fccs implementing regulations have been the subject of significant
litigation

     on august 21 2003 the fcc issued its decision in the proceeding it had
initiated to review the availability of unbundled network elements based on
current market conditions triennial review and adopted a new unbundling
framework under the new framework each state commission was authorized to
conduct a granular analysis of local market conditions using criteria provided
by the fcc to make final unbundling determinations in the same order and
subsequent rulings the fcc also granted the incumbent local exchange companies
significant broadband deregulation concluding that the incumbent lecs were no
longer required to unbundle fibertothehome loops fibertothe curb loops or
bandwidth in hybrid copper fiber loops for the provision of mass market
competitive broadband services the fcc also eliminated all linesharing
obligations aspects of the fccs august 21 2003 order were appealed to the
us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit on march 2 2004
the court vacated a number of the fcc rulings including the fccs delegation to
state commissions of decisions over impairment as applied to mass market
switching and certain transport elements and the fccs finding that the need
for so called hot cuts created a nationwide impairment justifying access to
mass market switching in light of the fccs decision not to appeal the dc
circuits decision and other anticipated changes in federal policy we announced
on july 22 2004 that we would cease active marketing of both local and long
distance services to mass market customers and focus our business on the sale of
telecommunications and related services to enterprise business customers

     on february 4 2005 the fcc released its order on remand from the dc
circuits decision in which it clarified and restated its unbundling rules in
response to the courts rulings in particular the fcc determined that
requesting carriers are not impaired under the statutory framework without
access to costbased massmarket switching thus competitors may not place
orders for new service arrangements that use such switching after the effective
date of the order march 11 2005 the commission also established a 12month
transition period from the effective date during which competitive carriers must
submit the necessary orders to convert their customers served using unbundled
mass market switching to an alternative service arrangement during the
transition period existing arrangements using mass market switching are subject
to an additional one dollar charge above stateset rates in addition the fcc
issued modified rules governing the unbundling of highcapacity loop and
transport facilities the new rules establish criteria that will eliminate
incumbent local exchange carrier unbundling obligations for various loop and
transport facilities depending on the size of the relevant incumbent local
exchange carrier wire centers and the number of competitive carriers that have
established facilitiesbased collocations in those wire centers facilities in
wire centers that are subject to such additional relief are also covered by a
12month transition 18 months for dark fiber facilities during which
competitive carriers may not buy new unbundled network elements but may serve
customers on existing elements at a rate that is 15 above stateset rates by
the end of the transition

                                        10
page

period all facilities purchased as unbundled network elements must be
transitioned to other arrangements finally the fcc determined that facilities
purchased as unbundled network elements may not be used exclusively to provide
either mobile wireless or interexchange service

     on september 15 2003 the fcc established a proceeding to determine
whether any changes are necessary to the pricing methodology commonly known as
the telric methodology that the state pucs must use in setting rates that we
and other carriers must pay for leasing unbundled network elements or facilities
from the incumbent local exchange carriers extensive comments have been filed
by all interested parties in the proceeding and it remains active but with no
projected date for a decision the importance of this proceeding is greatly
diminished by action of the fcc in the triennial review remand proceeding
described above which effectively eliminates unbundled network elements as a
viable means for providing mass market local services and reduces the
availability of unbundled highcapacity loop and transport facilities

     the fcc and various states have begun to consider whether and to what
extent voip communications should be subject to regulation like traditional
telecommunications services including whether voip services should be subject
to access charges 911 obligations and universal service funding obligations
the fcc has initiated a comprehensive rulemaking to address these voip issues
which remains active on april 21 2004 the fcc ruled against a petition we
filed in october 2002 holding that our long distance phonetophone ip
telephony services are subject to terminating access charges and could not be
terminated over end user local services as a result of this ruling we will
begin paying terminating access charges on our long distance phonetophone ip
telephony calls see item 3 below how might pending legal proceedings affect
us for a discussion of related litigation in response to a petition filed
by vonage holdings corporation on november 12 2004 the fcc held that voip
services that require broadband connection from the users location
ipcompatible customer premise equipment includes a suite of integrated
capabilities and features and allow customers to manage personal communications
dynamically would be treated as jurisdictionally interstate services our newer
voip services fall within this description and as a result will be subject
predominantly to fcc rules in march 2005 the fcc is expected to rule on a
petition filed by level 3 communications llc asking for a ruling that access
charges do not apply to voip services of the type described in the vonage order

     the fcc also opened proceedings in december 2001 and in february 2002 that
could further reduce the level of federal oversight of the regional phone
companies broadband offerings in addition several of the regional companies
have filed petitions with the fcc seeking forbearance of current regulatory
rules for their broadband services

     in view of the proceedings pending before the courts the fcc and state
pucs and possible legislation there can be no assurance that the prices and
other conditions established by the fcc and in the various states will provide
for effective local service competition or will not adversely affect our ability
to continue to serve existing markets or enter new markets as noted above in
anticipation of the changes in local competition rules following the dc
circuits march 2 2004 decision and the fccs decision not to appeal that
ruling we announced on july 22 2004 that we would cease active marketing
traditional telephone services both local and long distance to mass market
customers

     regulation of rates  we are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc with
respect to interstate and international rates lines and services and other
matters from july 1989 to october 1995 the fcc regulated us under a system
known as price caps whereby our prices rather than our earnings were
limited on october 12 1995 recognizing a decade of enormous change in the
long distance market and finding that we lacked market power in the interstate
long distance market the fcc reclassified us as a nondominant carrier for
its domestic interstate services subsequently the fcc determined that our
international services were also nondominant as a result we became subject to
the same regulations as our long distance competitors for these services

     in subsequent orders the fcc decided to exercise its authority to forbear
from requiring nondominant carriers to file tariffs for their services first
for domestic interstate services and then for international services

                                        11
page

     we remain subject to the statutory requirements of title ii of the
communications act of 1934 communications act as amended we must offer
telecommunications services under rates terms and conditions that are just
reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory we also are subject to the fccs
complaint process and we must give notice to the fcc and affected customers
prior to discontinuance reduction or impairment of our service

     in addition state public utility commissions or similar authorities having
regulatory power over intrastate rates lines and services and other matters
regulate our local and intrastate communications services the system of
regulation applied to our intrastate and local communications services varies
from state to state and generally includes various forms of pricing flexibility
rules our services are not regulated in the states through rate of return
regulation

     access charges are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the fcc and
state commissions in may 2000 the fcc adopted the calls order for the price
cap local exchange carriers which made significant access and price cap
changes the calls order reduced by 32 billion during 2000 the interstate
access charges that we and other long distance carriers paid to these local
exchange carriers for access to their networks and established target access
rates which in subsequent years resulted in further reductions albeit of a
much smaller magnitude as part of the calls order we agreed to pass through to
customers access charge reductions over the fiveyear life of the calls order
and made certain other commitments regarding the rate structure of certain
residential long distance offerings

     in november 2001 the fcc adopted various measures that reduced perminute
interstate access charges that we pay to the remaining local exchange carriers
that operate under rate of return regulation and provide about 8 of the
nations phone lines by july 2003 once these changes were fully implemented
long distance carriers started paying about 900 million or roughly 50 per
year less in access charges to these generally small rural local exchange
carriers the fcc did not require long distance carriers like us to pass on
our savings to end users but expected competition to force them to do so as
part of this ongoing proceeding the fcc is considering further measures that
would give these carriers additional pricing flexibility and possibly the option
to operate under some form of price cap regulation

     as a followon to calls the fcc announced on february 10 2005 that it
will issue a further notice of proposed rulemaking on a number of reform
proposals related to intercarrier compensation and other issues one proposal
was submitted by the intercarrier compensation forum icf of which we are a
member the icf proposal is a consensus plan that if adopted by the fcc would
unify the disparate network interconnection and intercarrier compensation
regimes governing interstate and intrastate switched access reciprocal
compensation and traffic with one end originating or terminating on voip
networks among other matters in addition the icf proposal also contains
modifications to the universal service system

     under its august 1999 local exchange carrier pricing flexibility order
which was affirmed by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia
circuit in february 2001 the fcc established certain triggers that enable the
price cap local exchange carriers to obtain pricing flexibility for their
interstate access services including phase ii relief that permits them to
remove these services from price cap regulation although these triggers
purportedly indicate a competitive presence they allow for premature
deregulation that in many cases has resulted in access rates that exceed those
that are still under price caps

     on january 31 2005 the fcc initiated a notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding the postcalls treatment of interstate special access services in
this proceeding the fcc will consider whether it should maintain modify or
repeal its pricing flexibility rules and other issues related to the price cap
regulation of special access services the fcc has sought comment on whether it
should reduce special access rates and whether it should grant interim relief
in this regard commencing as early as july 2005 if the fcc takes action to
reduce special access rates it could significantly lower our access expenses

     on december 9 2004 the fcc released an order granting a formal complaint
that we filed against bellsouth telecommunications inc and held that the
principal volume discount plan under which we currently obtain special access
service from bellsouth unlawfully discriminates in favor of bellsouths
interexchange affiliate in violation of section 272 of the communications act
the decision denied the

                                        12
page

complaint with respect to another bellsouth special access volume discount
plan the order directs bellsouth to terminate the unlawful discount plan not
later than june 9 2005 and encourages bellsouth to fashion a nondiscriminatory
replacement for that plan damages based on the december 9 orders liability
finding will be addressed by the fcc in a subsequent phase of the proceeding
both bellsouth and att have filed petitions for appellate review of the
commissions findings with respect to liability

     finally in the may 1997 universal service order the fcc adopted a new
mechanism for funding universal service which includes programs that defray the
costs of telephone service in high cost areas for low income consumers and for
schools libraries and rural health care providers and provides subsidies for
internet access and inside wiring to schools and libraries specifically the
fcc expanded the set of carriers that must contribute to support universal
service from solely long distance carriers to all carriers including local
exchange carriers that provide interstate telecommunications services
similarly the set of carriers eligible for the universal service support has
been expanded from only local exchange carriers to any eligible carrier
providing local service to a customer including us as a new entrant in local
markets the mechanism used to collect universal service contributions relied on
historical revenues which disproportionately shifted the burden of these
programs from carriers that are growing market share to carriers that are losing
market share like us in the long distance market in december 2002 the fcc
reformed the universal service assessment mechanism so that effective april
2003 it is based on projected revenues which eliminates the disadvantage that
we previously experienced the december 2002 order also limited how carriers
would be able to reflect universal service fees on their end user customers
bills and permitted alternative recovery mechanisms for administrative costs

     as part of the icf proposal discussed above the fcc will consider
reforming the federal universal service fund so that universal service is
supported through assessments on working telephone numbers and capacitybased
connections rather than revenues this numberscapacitybased approach to
universal service funding would free regulators from having to decide the
regulatory classification of a particular application and instead would base the
funding obligation on the customers working telephone number andor special
access connection while assuring a stable source of funding

     for an additional discussion of certain regulatory matters including the
fcc february 2005 prepaid card service decision see item 3 below how might
pending legal proceedings affect us

how and with whom do we compete

     competition in communications services is based on price and pricing plans
types of services offered customer service access to customer premises and
communications quality reliability and availability we face significant
competition in all these areas our principal competitors include mci sprint
and regional phone companies and other prepaid card providers in addition we
face a number of international competitors including equant british telecom and
singtel as well as from a number of large systems integrators such as
international business machines and electronic data systems we also experience
significant competition in long distance from newer entrants as well as
dialaround resellers in addition long distance telecommunications providers
have been facing competition from nontraditional sources including as a result
of technological substitutions such as voip high speed cable internet service
email and wireless services providers of competitive highspeed data offerings
include cable television companies direct broadcast satellite companies and dsl
resellers

     incumbent local exchange carriers own the only universal telephone
connection to the home have very substantial capital and other resources long
standing customer relationships and extensive existing facilities and network
rightsofway and are our primary competitors in the local services market we
also compete in the local services market with a number of competitive local
exchange carriers a few of which have existing local networks and significant
financial resources

     we currently face significant competition and expect that the level of
competition will continue to increase as competitive regulatory and
technological changes occur including those occasioned by the
telecommunications act we anticipate that new and different competitors will
enter and expand their position in the communications services markets these
will include regional phone company competitors plus entrants from other
segments of the communications and information services industry many of these
new

                                        13
page

competitors are likely to enter with a strong market presence well recognized
names and preexisting direct customer relationships

     for example the telecommunications act permits regional phone companies to
provide inregion interlata interexchange services after demonstrating to the
fcc that providing these services is in the public interest and satisfying the
conditions for developing local competition established by the
telecommunications act the regional phone companies had successfully obtained
fcc approval to offer long distance in all of the states within their regions by
the end of 2003 because substantial numbers of long distance customers seek to
purchase local interexchange and other services from a single carrier as part
of a combined or full service package any competitive disadvantage inability
to profitably provide local service at competitive rates or delays or
limitations in providing local service or combined service packages could
materially adversely affect our future revenue and earnings on july 22 2004 we
announced that as a result of recent changes in regulatory policy governing
local telephone service we would be shifting our focus away from traditional
mass market services and we would no longer be investing to acquire new mass
market local and standalone long distance customers

     in addition to the matters referred to above various other factors
including technological hurdles market acceptance startup and ongoing costs
associated with the provision of new services local conditions and obstacles
and changes in regulations or orders that grant to us access to regional phone
companies infrastructure could materially adversely affect our continued
ability to provide services in the local exchange services market and our
continued ability to offer combined service packages that include local service

what are the continuing implications of the splitoffs and spinoffs we have
effected

     since 1996 we have splitoff or spunoff a number of operating units
including lucent technologies inc ncr corp att wireless services inc
liberty media corporation and att broadband corp in connection with these
transactions we have retained various potential obligations and liabilities
relating to these former units for example we have entered into various
agreements which contain allocations or sharing of certain potential costs or
liabilities or otherwise contain continuing potential burdens or restrictions on
us these potential obligations and liabilities include potential tax
liabilities and restrictions potential litigation liabilities and the potential
for liability in connection with our guarantees to third parties of obligations
of our former units

     tax considerations  under an agreement between us and att
broadbandcomcast we generally will be entitled to indemnification for any tax
liability that results from the spinoff failing to qualify as a taxfree
transaction unless the tax liability was caused by post or spinoff
transactions of att att broadbandcomcasts indemnification obligation is
generally limited to 50 of any tax liability that results from the spinoff
failing to qualify as tax free unless such liability was caused by a post
spinoff transaction of att broadbandcomcast to the extent we were entitled
to an indemnity with respect to such tax liability we would be required to
collect the claim on an unsecured basis

     litigation  pursuant to agreements entered into with its former units we
share in the cost of certain litigation relating to matters arising while the
units were affiliated with att if the settlement exceeds certain thresholds
for example in connection with a settlement in 2002 of sparks v att a class
action against att lucent technologies and other defendants filed in 1996
pursuant to agreements between us and lucent technologies we are responsible
for our proportionate share of the settlement and estimated legal costs we
anticipate that this amount may total as much as 33 million net of tax
similarly pursuant to agreements between att and ncr corp we are potentially
responsible for a portion of any award or settlement relating to the
environmental proceedings brought by certain federal and state governmental
agencies arising out of the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in
sediments in the lower fox river and in the bay of green bay in wisconsin fox
river ncr was identified as a potentially responsible party because pcbs were
purportedly discharged from two carbonless copy paper manufacturing facilities
it previously owned which are located along the fox river with the exception
of the sparks and the fox river matters as of december 31 2004 we have made
the assessment that none of the potential litigation liabilities relating to
matters arising while the units were affiliated with att were probable of
incurring costs in excess of the threshold above which we would be required to
share in the costs however in the event these former units were unable to meet
their obligations with respect to these liabilities due to financial
difficulties we could be held responsible for all or a portion of the costs
irrespective of the sharing agreements

     guarantees  from time to time we have guaranteed to third parties the debt
or other obligations of our former units and in some cases may remain
secondarily liable with respect to such obligations in addition in connection
with the splitoff or spinoff of our former units we have issued guarantees to
third parties for certain debt or other obligations of our former units in the
event our former units are unable to meet obligations which we have guaranteed
the third parties could look to us for payment

what special considerations should investors consider

     investors should carefully consider the following factors regarding their
investment in our securities

     our stock price would likely be adversely affected if we do not consummate
our transaction with sbc  the agreement we entered into with sbc and its wholly
owned subsidiary contains numerous conditions to sbcs obligation to close its
acquisition of us these conditions include

      approval of our shareholders

      obtaining approval of the fcc state public utility commissions
       antitrust clearance and certain other governmental approvals

      operating our business in compliance with the covenants set forth in the
       agreement and

      continued accuracy of our representations and warranties including the
       absence of any material adverse effect on our business

     we cannot be certain we will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or
that we will satisfy other closing conditions if the transaction were
terminated or if it appeared reasonably likely to be terminated this would
likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price

     our business could be adversely impacted by our pending transaction with
sbc  uncertainty about the effect of our pending transaction with sbc could
adversely affect our business this uncertainty could lead to a loss of customer
accounts an acceleration in revenue declines an impairment of our ability to
make needed process and operational improvements in our business an inability
to retain or motivate current employees or attract new employees and a
deterioration in our results of operations these adverse effects may be
enhanced by the fact that the governmental and regulatory approval process for
the sbc transaction may be lengthy and the ultimate result is uncertain

     we expect there to be a continued decline in the voice long distance
industry  historically prices for voice communications have fallen because of
competition the introduction of more efficient networks and advanced
technology product substitution excess capacity and deregulation we expect
these trends to continue and we may need to continue to reduce prices in the
future in addition we do not expect that we will be able to achieve increased
traffic volumes in the near future to sustain current revenue levels the extent
to which each of our businesses financial condition results of operations and
cash flow could be materially adversely affected will depend on the pace at
which these industrywide changes continue

     we face substantial competition that may materially adversely impact both
market share and margins  we currently face significant competition and we
expect the level of competition to continue to increase some of the potential
materially adverse consequences of this competition include the following

      possibility that customers shift to less profitable lower margin
       services

      need to initiate or respond to price cuts in order to retain market
       share

      difficulties in att business services ability to grow new businesses
       introduce new services successfully or execute on its business plan

      accelerating erosion of att consumer services customer base compounded
       by our decision to no longer invest in the active acquisition of any new
       residential local or standalone long distance customers and

      inability to purchase fairly priced access services or fairly priced
       elements of local carriers networks

     we face competition from a variety of sources

      we traditionally have competed with other long distance carriers in
       recent years we have begun to compete with regional phone companies
       which own their own access facilities and historically have dominated
       local telecommunications and with other competitive local exchange
       carriers for the

                                        16

       provision of local and long distance services regional phone companies
       now have received permission to offer long distance services in all of
       the states within their regions the regional phone companies presently
       have numerous advantages as a result of their ownership of local
       exchanges and facilities some of the regional phone companies have
       financial personnel and other resources significantly greater than ours
       in addition the regional phone companies are able to offer bundled
       products and services in certain states that we are unable to match to
       the extent consumers prefer bundled offers such as those offers that
       include local long distance and wireless services we will be at a
       disadvantage to certain of our competitors including the regional phone
       companies

      competition as a result of technological change  we are also subject to
       additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies
       and the increased availability of domestic and international transmission
       capacity the telecommunications industry is in a period of rapid
       technological evolution marked by the introduction of new product and
       service offerings and increasing satellite wireless fiber optic and
       coaxial cable transmission capacity for services similar to those
       provided by us we cannot predict which of many possible future product
       and service offerings will be important to maintain our competitive
       position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide
       these products and services

      competition as a result of excess capacity  we face competition as a
       result of excess capacity resulting from substantial network build out by
       competitors

      competition from restructured competitors  we face competition from
       competitors which have been restructured in some cases through
       bankruptcy proceedings to improve their financial condition

     the regulatory and legislative environment creates challenges for us  we
face risks relating to regulations and legislation these risks include

      changes in federal policy reducing costbased access to unbundled
       elements in the incumbent local exchange carriers networks and reducing
       competitive access to incumbent lec broadband facilities

      difficulty of establishing and maintaining effective competition in local
       markets due to noncompetitive pricing and to regional phone company
       operational issues that do not permit rapid large scale customer changes
       from regional phone companies to new service providers

      new headon competition as regional phone companies enter and expand
       their presence in the long distance business

      emergence of few facilitiesbased competitors to regional phone
       companies and the absence of any significant alternate source of supply
       for most access and local services and

      threats to the viability of our local voice business resulting from the
       partial vacating of the fccs triennial review order by a us court of
       appeals

     this dependency on supply materially adversely impacts our cost structure
and ability to create and market desirable and competitive endtoend products
for customers

     in addition regional phone companies have entered the long distance
business throughout the us while they still control substantially all the
access facilities in their regions this has resulted in an increased level of
competition for long distance or endtoend services as the services offered by
regional phone companies expand

     in the consumer business substantially all of the telephone calls made by
our customers are connected using other companies networks including those of
competitors which makes competition more difficult for us  we provide long
distance and to a limited extent local telecommunications over our own
transmission facilities because our network does not extend to homes we route
calls through a local telephone company to reach our transmission facilities
and ultimately to reach their final destinations in the us the providers
of local telephone service generally are the incumbent local exchange carriers
including the regional phone companies

     our financial condition and prospects may be materially adversely affected
by further ratings downgrades  during the third quarter of 2004 atts long
term and short term credit ratings were lowered by standard  poors moodys
and fitch as reflected in the table below

as of december 31 2004

fitch      b           bb      negative
moodys      nr          ba1      negative


     however given the sbc acquisition announcement on january 31 2005 and
february 1 2005 fitch and standard  poors respectively placed atts long
term debt ratings on watch positive and removed the outlook negative on january
31 2005 moodys placed atts long term debt rating on review for possible
upgrade and removed the outlook negative in addition based on atts request
standard  poors and moodys withdrew atts short term credit ratings our
debt ratings would be adversely affected if we failed to consummate our
transaction with sbc our access to capital markets as well as the cost of our
borrowings are affected by our debt ratings the third quarter rating actions
discussed above and further debt rating downgrades will require us to pay higher
rates on certain existing debt and have required us to post cash collateral for
certain interestrate swaps in which we were in a net payable position
additionally if our debt ratings are further downgraded our access to the
capital markets may be further restricted andor such replacement financing may
be more costly or have additional covenants than we had in connection with our
debt at december 31 2004 in addition the market environment for financing in
general and within the telecommunications sector in particular has been
adversely affected by economic conditions and bankruptcies of other
telecommunications providers

     the sbc merger agreement provides that we cannot incur additional
indebtedness over 100 million in the aggregate or issue equity or convertible
securities without the prior consent of sbc without limitation this could
materially limit our ability to make drawings under our 1 billion dollar credit
facility to increase the amount of our financing of accounts receivable under
our securitization facility to issue commercial paper or to utilize our
universal shelf registration statement for financing purposes in addition the
merger agreement requires us to pay a special dividend in excess of 1 billion
in connection with the closing of the transaction the combination of the
requirement to reserve cash to pay the special dividend and the restriction on
our ability to utilize sources of liquidity could have a material adverse
affect on our liquidity position in addition the sbc merger agreement contains
restrictions on our ability to enter into derivatives contracts without the
prior consent of sbc

item 3  legal proceedings

how might pending legal proceedings affect us

     in the normal course of business we are subject to proceedings lawsuits
and other claims including proceedings under government laws and regulations
related to environmental and other matters such matters are subject to many
uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance consequently we
are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or
financial impact with respect to these matters on december 31 2004 while these
matters could affect operating results of any one quarter when resolved in
future periods it is managements opinion that after final disposition any
monetary liability or financial impact to us beyond that provided for at
yearend would not be material to our annual consolidated financial position or
results of operations

     we were named as a defendant in a consolidated group of purported
securities class action lawsuits filed in the united states district courts for
the district of new jersey filed on behalf of persons who purchased our common
stock from october 25 1999 through may 1 2000 the consolidated lawsuit
asserted claims under section 10b and rule 10b5 and section 20a of the
securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and alleges among other things
that during the period referenced above we made materially false and misleading
statements and omitted to state material facts concerning our future business
prospects the consolidated complaint sought unspecified damages after several
days of trial we settled this lawsuit for 100 million while we denied any
wrongdoing asserted against us we settled this lawsuit to avoid the uncertainty
of a jury verdict and the expense of continuing the litigation to the end of the
trial and through the appeal process our liability for this settlement will be
shared equally between us and comcast

                                        20

     we have also been named as a defendant in another consolidated group of
securities class actions filed in the united states district court for the
southern district of new york filed on behalf of investors who purchased shares
in the att wireless initial public offering from april 26 2000 through may 1
2000 this consolidated action asserts claims under sections 11 12 and 15 of
the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 10b and rule 10b5 and
section 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and alleges
that we made materially false and misleading statements and omitted to state
material facts in the initial public offering prospectus about our future
business prospects the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages we believe that the
lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend it vigorously

     on december 22 2003 two participants in our long term savings plan for
management employees the plan filed purported class actions in new jersey
federal court on behalf of all plan participants who purchased or held shares of
att stock fund att stock att wireless stock fund or att wireless stock
between september 30 1999 and may 1 2000 the complaint asserts claims similar
to those made in the securities class action lawsuit described above alleging
that we made materially false and misleading statements and omitted to state
material facts concerning our future business prospects as a result of this
purported conduct we are alleged to have breached our fiduciary duties to the
plan and the plans participants the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages we
believe that the lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend them
vigorously

     through a former subsidiary we owned approximately 23 of the outstanding
common stock and 74 of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of at
home corporation at home which filed for bankruptcy protection on september
28 2001 until october 1 2001 att appointed a majority of at homes
directors and thereafter we appointed none on november 7 2002 the trustee for
the bondholders liquidating trust of at home the bondholders filed a lawsuit
in california state court asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty relating
to the conduct of att and its designees on the at home board of directors in
connection with at homes declaration of bankruptcy and subsequent efforts to
dispose of some of its businesses or assets as well as in connection with other
aspects of our relationship with at home on november 15 2002 the bondholders
filed a lawsuit in california federal court asserting a claim for patent
infringement relating to atts broadband distribution and highspeed internet
backbone networks and equipment the bondholders seek unspecified damages in
these lawsuits we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to
defend them vigorously

     in addition purported class action lawsuits have been filed in california
state court on behalf of at home shareholders against att at home and the
directors of at home cox and comcast the lawsuits claim that the defendants
breached fiduciary obligations of care candor and loyalty in connection with a
transaction announced in march 2000 in which among other things att cox and
comcast agreed to extend existing distribution agreements the board of
directors of at home was reorganized and we agreed to give cox and comcast
rights to sell their at home shares to us these actions have been consolidated
by the court and are subject to a stay atts liability for any such suits
would be shared equally between us and comcast in march 2002 a purported class
action was filed in the united states district court for the southern district
of new york against inter alia att and certain of its senior officers
alleging violations of the federal securities law in connection with the
disclosures made by at home in the period from april 17 through august 28 2001
we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend them
vigorously

     the creditors of at home filed a preference action against att in the at
home bankruptcy proceeding pending in california federal court the complaint
alleges that we should be viewed as an insider of at home on this theory at
home seeks to avoid one years worth of payments to us as opposed to the
noninsider ninetyday period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition
the plaintiffs seek damages of approximately 896 million from att and
comcast we believe that this action is without merit and intend to defend it
vigorously

     thirty putative class actions have been filed in various jurisdictions
around the country challenging the manner in which we disclose fccimposed
universal service fund charges to our customers and recoup those charges from
our customers the plaintiffs in each lawsuit seek unspecified damages we
believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend them
vigorously

                                        21

     more than thirty class actions have been brought against us throughout the
country in which the plaintiffs have asserted superior property rights with
respect to railroad right of way corridors on which we have installed fiber
optic cable under agreements with the various railroads although we deny any
liability we have engaged in settlement negotiations concerning the socalled
active line claims and any remaining abandoned line claims that have been
consolidated and are pending in indiana federal court we have settled claims on
a statebystate basis and obtained final approval of such claims in ohio
connecticut wisconsin maryland virginia delaware west virginia idaho
massachusetts and michigan in addition in january of 2005 we obtained
preliminary approval for settlements in vermont minnesota kansas maine and
texas and final fairness hearings to approve the settlements are scheduled in
may for vermont and minnesota and july for kansas maine and texas we also
anticipate using these settlements as a template for settling claims in other
states none of the current settlements or the settlements we are currently
planning involve claims along railroad right of way obtained under federal land
grant statutes nor do they address claims that are based upon the installation
of fiber optic cable in pipeline or other utility right of way

     we filed an application for a declaratory ruling with the fcc to decide the
issue of whether phonetophone internet protocol telephony is exempt from
paying access charges the fcc ruled against us and as a result we began
paying terminating access charges on our long distance phonetophone internet
protocol telephony calls in its decision the fcc did not make any
determination regarding the appropriateness of retroactive application of its
ruling the fcc left the matter to be decided on a fact specific casebycase
basis following the fcc ruling qwest communications international inc qwest
filed a lawsuit in federal district court in colorado in which it asserted a
claim alleging that we avoided interstate and intrastate access charges by
delivering long distance calls to qwest for termination over qwests local
facilities qwest is seeking tens of millions of dollars in access charges
from us sbc filed a lawsuit in federal district court in missouri asserting
claims similar to those asserted against us by qwest sbc is seeking 141
million in access charges although other carriers have expressed an intention
to make similar claims to date no other lawsuits have been filed in our view
our total potential exposure could be as much as 250 million if we were
required to make payments retroactively we believe we have a number of defenses
to these claims and intend to defend against them vigorously

     qwest has filed a claim against us seeking payment of approximately 60
million in alleged undercharges in connection with terminating toll free calls
we dispute the allegations of these claims and believe that we have acted
consistently with the terms and conditions of our underlying agreements with
qwest in addition we believe that qwests claims have been released in the
ordinary course of business between qwest and us to the extent that qwest may
be entitled to any damages such damages cannot be substantiated at this time

     in february 2005 the fcc ruled against att in its petition for a
declaratory ruling that our enhanced prepaid card service is an interstate
information service the fcc did not agree with our position that intrastate
access charges should not apply to calls made using an enhanced prepaid card
when 1 the prepaid card platform is located outside the state in which either
the calling or the called party is located and 2 the called party receives an
advertisement from the platform which constitutes a separate interstate
communication the fcc also did not agree with our position that our enhanced
prepaid card service is an information service and held that it is a
telecommunications service and that we had to make universal service fund usf
contributions on revenue derived from the service since we did not pay usf and
paid lower interstate access rates these savings have permitted us to sell
prepaid cards at prices below what otherwise would have been possible the
recent adverse ruling by the fcc on the prepaid card petition will increase the
future cost of providing the types of prepaid cards that were addressed in the
fcc decision and may materially adversely affect future sales of prepaid cards
in addition the fcc ruling directs att to pay past due universal service
amounts including late fees invoiced by the universal service administrator
and exposes us to potential retroactive liability for intrastate access charges
accordingly we accrued 553 million as of december 2004 for these matters we
intend to appeal the fcc decision to a federal court of appeals

     following this fcc decision qwest filed a lawsuit against us in colorado
federal court relating to this issue asserting claims for breach of federal and
state tariffs unjust enrichment fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of
contract qwest seeks unspecified damages we intend to vigorously defend this
and any similar cases that may be filed

delaware state court alleging that we purportedly breached certain contractual
obligations we allegedy had to preserve the value of stock options originally
available to officers and directors of mediaone and us west at the time of the
mediaone merger with us in june of 2000 the plaintiffs seek unspecified
damages we believe that this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend it
vigorously

     certain participants in our pension plan filed a class action in new jersey
federal court asserting claims pursuant to the employee retirement income
security act of 1974 these claims relate to changes we made in our pension plan
and the manner in which we communicated information concerning those changes to
the plans participants the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages we believe
that this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend it vigorously

     there is one pending environmental proceeding by a government authority
that is required to be reported pursuant to instruction 5c of item 103 of
regulation sk we have entered into a consent decree with the us department
of justice which has submitted it for approval by the us district court for
the district of the virgin islands under which att would pay a civil penalty

financial condition as of december 31 2004 and 2003

overview

     on many levels 2004 was a historic year for att corp att we saw a
continuation of the industry challenges experienced over the past few years
ongoing competitive factors included substitution oversupply and pricing
pressure in addition 2004 brought fundamental changes in the regulatory
environment in june 2004 provisions of the telecommunications act of 1996
which provided a means for long distance companies like att to compete in the
local telephone markets by leasing elements of other companies local networks
at economic rates were radically altered as a result we made a decision in
july 2004 to no longer compete for traditional residential local and long
distance customers while we will continue to serve our existing customer base
we will no longer invest to acquire new residential customers this strategic
shift triggered an evaluation of our longlived assets and in the third quarter
of 2004 we recorded an 114 billion impairment charge

     the start of 2005 is bringing historic changes as well in january 2005 we
announced an agreement in which sbc communications inc sbc would acquire
att we believe the combination of these

                                        27

                          att corp and subsidiaries
                    managements discussion and analysis of
          financial condition and results of operations  continued

companies will create a premier communications and networking company this
agreement is subject to att shareholder and a variety of regulatory approvals
however we expect the transaction to close in late 2005 or early 2006

     during 2004 we continued our momentum of reducing costs but also invested
in systems and technologies that provide a range of process efficiency and
automation initiatives for our customers and us we targeted the specific needs
of these business customers by offering them an unmatched depth and breadth of
products and services and an endtoend global solutions set including voice
data hosting access business continuity internet protocol and enhanced
ipe services and managed services

     in 2004 we also continued our deleveraging efforts to strengthen our
financial position by reducing total debt 37 billion or more than 25
largely as a result of early redemptions of debt

     despite our efforts we continued to be negatively impacted by industry and
economic factors and our 2004 results reflect these impacts business long
distance revenue declined significantly as competition has led to lower prices
in both retail and wholesale markets and loss of market share in the small and
mediumsized business markets in addition long distance volumes were
essentially flat as the decline we experienced in the retail markets driven by
competition and product substitution was largely offset by growth in wholesale
markets our wholesale business represents sales of long distance voice services
to resellers such as other long distance companies local phone service
providers wireless carriers and cable companies in 2004 the rate of growth in
wholesale declined as the level of new wholesale contracts slowed however as
retail volumes decline wholesale volumes continue to become a larger percentage
of total business volumes and represented 55 of the total in 2004 compared
with 50 in 2003 and 37 in 2002

     competition also negatively impacted revenue from data products we will
continue to experience declines in long distance and data as we expect
competition to continue to result in lower prices

     the increase in wholesale volumes as a percentage of total volumes
created pressure on the operating income margin as this business has a lower
margin than the retail long distance business due to substantially lower rates
per minute operating income margin was also negatively impacted by growth in
some of our advanced services such as ipe our focus on new services while
essential to our business strategy will continue to have a negative impact on
operating income margin for att business services given the lower margin
associated with these new services compared with our declining legacy products
of retail long distance voice and data services

     att consumer services long distance voice business has experienced
similar trends to those of att business services standalone long distance
voice services revenue has continued to decline due to competition and
technology substitution customers using wireless or internet services in lieu
of a wireline call in addition customers continued to migrate to lowerpriced
calling plans and to bundled calling plans customers that migrate to bundled
calling plans negatively impact standalone long distance revenue but
positively contribute to growth in bundled revenue although generally to a
lesser degree as bundled long distance pricing is lower due to our decision to
no longer invest to acquire new residential local and long distance customers
the negative trends in standalone long distance are expected to accelerate in
2005 however unlike 2004 and 2003 we do not expect migration to bundled
calling plans to mitigate these declines to the same degree

     companywide reductions within costs of services and products and selling
general and administrative expenses are indicative of our success in controlling
costs as part of our efforts we reduced total headcount by 23 which
partially benefited 2004 but will more significantly benefit 2005 much of this
headcount reduction was facilitated by the investments we made to streamline our
processes that allowed us to cut costs while also enhancing the customer
experience

          financial condition and results of operations  continued

     other costs such as access and other connection expenses which represent
the costs we pay to other services providers to connect calls using their
facilities are less subject to our control given they are based on rates
generally set by governmental agencies many of these costs are volume driven
and as volumes of lowerpriced services increase these costs increase as a
percentage of revenue generating a negative impact to profit margins in order
to control these costs we continually search for alternate ways of connecting
to our customers

critical accounting estimates and judgments

     the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and
expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions

     we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe
require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because
changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of
materially impacting our financial statements

     estimated useful lives of plant and equipment  we estimate the useful
lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation
expense to be recorded during any reporting period the majority of our
telecommunications plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method
which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life
of a specific group of assets rather than for each individual asset as would be
utilized under the unit method the estimated life of the group is reviewed
annually after discussions with network engineers and a review of activity
levels within the asset categories such estimated life of the group is based on
historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account
anticipated technological or other changes if technological changes were to
occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated the
useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened resulting in the
recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods likewise if
the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than expected
the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets
added to the group this could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in
future periods a oneyear decrease or increase in the useful life of these
assets would have increased or decreased depreciation expense by approximately
05 billion and 03 billion respectively

     recovery of longlived assets other than goodwill  in accordance with
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets we review these types of assets
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable over the remaining life of the asset or asset
group in order to determine if the asset or asset group is recoverable we
determine if the expected future cash flows directly related to the asset or
asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group if
so we then determine if the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds
its fair value we determine fair value using estimated discounted cash flows
the discounted cash flows calculation uses various assumptions and estimates
regarding future revenue expenses and cash flows projections over the estimated
remaining useful life of the asset or asset group these forecasts are subject
to changes in external factors including adverse regulatory and legal rulings
in the third quarter of 2004 we announced a strategic change in business focus
which created a triggering event for a review of our longlived assets as a
result of this review we determined that an impairment charge of 114 billion
representing the difference between the fair value of the asset group and its
carrying value was required the use of different assumptions within our
discounted cash flows model when determining fair value including the selection
of the discount rate could result in different valuations for our

                                        29

                    managements discussion and analysis of
          financial condition and results of operations  continued

longlived assets a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount
rate would have increased or decreased the impairment by approximately 04
billion additionally a one percentage point increase or decrease in the
estimated annual undiscounted cash flows utilized in our assessment would have
decreased or increased the impairment by approximately 01 billion

     recovery of goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and
other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment annually or more
frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of our business enterprise below its carrying
value the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our overall
business enterprise at the reporting unit level we estimate fair value using
both a discounted cash flows model as well as an approach using market
comparables both of which are weighted equally to determine fair value under
the discounted cash flows method we utilize estimated longterm revenue and
cash flows forecasts developed as part of our planning process as well as
assumptions of terminal value together with an applicable discount rate to
determine fair value these forecasts are subject to changes in external factors
including adverse regulatory and legal rulings under the market approach fair
value is determined by a comparison to similar businesses or guideline
companies selection of guideline companies requires managements judgment the
use of different assumptions within our discounted cash flows model or within
our market approach model when determining fair value could result in different
valuations for goodwill in the third quarter of 2004 we announced a strategic
change in business focus which resulted in a triggering event for a review of
our goodwill at the time this review was undertaken the fair value of our att
business services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 13 billion and
the fair value of our att consumer services reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by 21 billion accordingly no impairment of goodwill was
required the carrying values of the reporting units already reflected
longlived asset impairments recognized in the third quarter in connection with
the same triggering event our annual testing of goodwill is traditionally
performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year however our third quarter
review satisfied our annual review requirement based on the satisfaction of
certain criteria outlined in sfas no 142

     access and other connection expenses  we use various estimates and
assumptions to determine the amount of access and other connection expenses
recognized during any reporting period switched access costs are accrued
utilizing estimated rates by product formulated from historical data and
adjusted for known rate changes and volume levels which are estimated for
certain products and known for other products such estimates are adjusted
monthly to reflect newly available information such as rate changes and new
contractual agreements bills reflecting actual incurred information are
generally not received until three to nine months subsequent to the end of the
reporting period at which point a final adjustment is made to the accrued
switched access expense dedicated access costs are estimated based on the
number of circuits and the average projected circuit costs based on historical
data adjusted for rate changes these costs are adjusted to reflect actual
expenses over the three months following the end of the reporting period as
bills are received as of december 31 2004 approximately 11 billion was
accrued relating to our estimated switched and dedicated access costs

     pension and postretirement benefits  the amounts recognized in the
financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are
determined on an actuarial basis utilizing several different assumptions a
significant assumption used in determining our net pension cost income and
postretirement benefit expense is the expected longterm rate of return on plan
assets in 2004 we used an expected longterm rate of return of 85 for 2005
this rate was reduced 25 basis points to 825 for pension assets and 75 basis
points to 775 for postretirement assets in determining these rates we
considered the current and projected investment portfolio mix and estimated
longterm investment returns for each asset class the projected portfolio mix
of plan assets is developed in consideration of the expected duration of related
plan obligations and as such is more heavily weighted toward equity
investments including public and private equity positions the actual average
return on pension plan assets over the last 10 and 15 years has been 124 and

                                        30

110 per annum respectively the expected return on plan assets is determined
by applying the expected longterm rate of return to the marketrelated value of
plan assets asset gains and losses resulting from actual returns that differ
from our expected returns are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets
evenly over a fiveyear period the marketrelated value is constrained to be
within 85 to 115 of the fair market value of assets the marketrelated value
of plan assets of the pension and postretirement benefit plans as of december
31 2004 was approximately 189 billion about 20 billion lower than the
related fair value of plan assets the expected return on assets of the pension
and postretirement benefit plans included in 2004 operating income was income of
16 billion holding all other factors constant a 50 basis point decrease or
increase in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have
decreased or increased 2004 operating income by approximately 01 billion

     another significant estimate is the discount rate used in the annual
actuarial valuation of pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations in
determining the appropriate discount rate at year end we considered the current
yields on high quality corporate fixedincome investments with maturities
corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations as a result
of the plan curtailments that occurred in the third quarter the assets and
liabilities of our pension and postretirement plans were remeasured at september
30 2004 and the discount rate used was reduced 25 basis points to 575 this
rate remained unchanged as of december 31 2004 changes to the discount rate do
not have a material impact on our results of operations however the discount
rate does impact the benefit obligations holding all other factors constant a
50 basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate would increase or
decrease the projected pension and postretirement benefit obligations by
approximately 12 billion

     income taxes  assessment of the appropriate amount and classification of
income taxes is dependent on several factors including estimates of the timing
and probability of realization of deferred income taxes and the timing of income
tax payments deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary
differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that if
changed would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for
income taxes in the period of change a one percentage point increase in the
enacted federal income tax rate as of december 31 2004 would have increased
net loss by approximately 10 million a valuation allowance is recorded when it
is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized in
assessing the likelihood of realization management considers available
carryback capacity prior years results of operations estimates of future
taxable income the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits
and all available evidence both negative and positive the valuation allowance
was 06 billion at december 31 2004 actual income taxes could vary from
estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes
in income tax laws our financial condition and results of operations in future
periods as well as final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities
which as a matter of course are regularly audited by federal state and
foreign tax authorities

     legal contingencies  we are currently involved in certain legal
proceedings and have accrued amounts as appropriate that represent our estimate
of the probable outcome of these matters the judgments we make with regard to
whether to establish a reserve are based on an evaluation of all relevant
factors by internal and external legal counsel as well as subject matter
experts the relevant factors analyzed include an analysis of the complaint
documents testimony and other materials as applicable the damages claimed in
most legal proceedings are not a meaningful predictor of actual potential
liability because the amounts claimed generally have little or no relationship
to the actual damages suffered or sustained in certain cases the plaintiff may
not have asserted a specified amount of damages claims are continually
monitored and reevaluated as new information is obtained we may not establish a
liability for a particular matter until long after the litigation is filed once
a liability becomes probable and estimable the actual settlement of such
matters could differ from the judgments made in determining how much if any to
accrue in addition we may be responsible for a

portion of certain legal proceedings associated with former affiliates pursuant
to separation and distribution agreements such agreements require us to share
in the cost of certain litigation relating to matters while affiliated with
att if a judgment or settlement exceeds certain thresholds however in the
event these former subsidiaries are unable to meet their obligations with
respect to these liabilities due to financial difficulties we could be held
responsible for all or a portion of these costs irrespective of the sharing
agreements

     other significant accounting policies not involving the same degree of
judgment and uncertainty as those discussed above are nevertheless important to
an understanding of the financial statements see note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements for a discussion of accounting policies that we have
selected from acceptable alternatives

consolidated results of operations

     the comparison of 2003 results with 2002 results was impacted by events
pertaining to our investment in att latin america for the period august 28
2000 through december 31 2002 our interest in att latin america was fully
consolidated in our results in december 2002 we signed a nonbinding
termsheet for the sale of our 69 economic interest 95 voting interest in
att latin america and began accounting for att latin america as an asset held
for sale the operations of att latin america did not qualify for treatment as
a discontinued operation as a result we recorded an impairment charge of 10
billion to write down att latin americas assets and liabilities to fair value
the operating losses of att latin america for 2003 are reflected in asset
impairment and net restructuring and other charges on april 21 2003 att
latin america filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and on june 30 2003 the att
appointed members of the att latin america board of directors resigned they
were replaced with three new independent directors this action resulted in the
deconsolidation of att latin america as of june 30 2003

     our consolidated financial statements reflect att broadband as a
discontinued operation att broadband was spunoff on november 18 2002
accordingly the revenue expenses and cash flows of att broadband have been
excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated statements of
operations and consolidated statements of cash flows and have been reported
through the date of separation as net loss from discontinued operations and as
net cash used in discontinued operations

     total revenue decreased 116 or 40 billion in 2004 compared with 2003
and decreased 87 or 33 billion in 2003 compared with 2002 the decrease in
both years was largely driven by continued declines in standalone long distance
voice revenue of approximately 39 billion in 2004 and 40 billion in 2003
reflecting increased competition which has led to lower prices and loss of
market share in att consumer services and small and mediumsized business
markets in addition standalone long distance revenue was negatively impacted
by substitution and customer migration to lowerpriced products and calling
plans these declines were partially offset by strength in business wholesale
volumes predominantly in 2003 total long

distance voice volumes including long distance volumes sold as part of a
bundled offer decreased approximately 5 in 2004 primarily due to declines in
business retail and consumer volumes partially offset by growth in lowerpriced
business wholesale volumes total long distance voice volumes increased
approximately 4 in 2003 as growth in business wholesale volumes more than
offset the declines in business retail and consumer volumes also contributing
to the 2004 and 2003 revenue declines was lower data services revenue in att
business services of 09 billion and 05 billion respectively mostly driven
by competitive pricing pressure weak demand and technology migration primarily
in bandwidth and packet services in addition lower outsourcing and
professional services revenue of 03 billion in 2004 and 05 billion in 2003
contributed to the revenue declines

     partially offsetting the declines in total revenue was an increase in
bundled services revenue primarily local and long distance voice in att
consumer services of approximately 07 billion in 2004 and 09 billion in
2003 resulting from subscriber growth also positively contributing to total
revenue was att business services local revenue which increased 02 billion
in 2004 and 03 billion in 2003 and ipe services revenue which increased 02
billion in 2004 and 03 billion in 2003 the local services revenue growth in
2004 was positively impacted by a reciprocal compensation settlement

     in 2005 we expect total revenue to be between 25 billion and 26 billion
as standalone long distance voice revenue and data services revenue will
continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing competition and the associated
pricing pressure and product substitution coupled with declines in att
business services local voice revenue and att consumer services bundled revenue
due to our shift in focus away from these products as a result of changes in the
regulatory environment

line basis since most of the universal service fund contributions and perline
charges are passed through to the customer a reduction in these rates generally
results in a corresponding reduction in revenue

     access and other connection expenses decreased 03 billion or 32 in
2004 compared with 2003 domestic access charges for 2004 included 06 billion
of access charges and universal service fund contributions relating to our
enhanced prepaid card service accrued as a result of the february 2005 fcc
ruling see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information domestic access charges for 2003 included a 01 billion access
expense adjustment to reflect the proper estimate of the liability relating to
access costs incurred in 2001 and 2002 excluding these charges domestic access
charges declined 10 billion in 2004 primarily due to lower universal service
fund contributions of 03 billion resulting from the decline in long distance
revenue and lower average rates of 03 billion the lower rates which include
the impact of settlements were due in part to a greater proportion of calls that
have nonaccess incurring terminations such as when a call terminates over our
own network or over a leased line as well as from rate negotiations and more
efficient network usage also contributing to the decline were lower costs of
02 billion due to lower overall volumes and changes in product mix of 02
billion including whether calls are interstate versus intrastate the declines
in domestic access charges were partially offset by increased local connectivity
costs of 03 billion primarily as a result of subscriber increases due to
increased penetration into existing states and new state entries during 2004

     in 2005 we expect access and other connection expenses to be lower than in
2004 primarily due to lower volumes expected from declines in customer levels
at att consumer services and small business markets in part driven by our
strategic decision in 2004 to shift our focus away from traditional consumer
services and changes in the regulatory environment as well as due to our
ongoing efforts to manage our network and negotiate lower rates and continued
changes in product mix

     access and other connection expenses increased 01 or 7 million in 2003
compared with 2002 access charges for 2003 included a 01 billion access
expense adjustment to reflect the proper estimate of the liability relating to
access costs incurred in 2001 and 2002 excluding this adjustment domestic
access charges declined 05 billion in 2003 primarily due to more efficient
network usage and product mix aggregating 04 billion in addition the decline
was due to lower universal service fund contributions of 02 billion resulting
from the decline in long distance voice revenue and lower perline charges of
01 billion due to a decline in customer levels these declines in domestic
access charges were partially offset by higher costs of 02 billion as a result
of overall long distance volume growth also contributing to the decline in
access and other connection expenses were lower international connection charges
of 01 billion primarily as a result of lower rates these declines were
partially offset by an increase in local connectivity costs of 05 billion
primarily due to local subscriber increases resulting from new state entries and
growth in existing markets

     costs of services and products include the costs of operating and
maintaining our networks the provision for uncollectible receivables and other
servicerelated costs including the cost of equipment sold

     costs of services and products decreased 06 billion or 72 in 2004
compared with 2003 approximately 04 billion of the decline was attributable
to the overall impact of lower revenue and related costs including cost cutting
initiatives primarily headcount reductions also contributing to the decline
was a lower provision for uncollectible receivables of 03 billion resulting
from improved collections and lower revenue these declines were partially
offset by 01 billion due to the impact of a weak us dollar

     we expect costs of services and products will continue to decline in 2005
driven by our ongoing cost control efforts and lower expected revenue

     costs of services and products decreased 07 billion or 88 in 2003
compared with 2002 approximately 06 billion of the decline was attributable

receivables of 04 billion resulting from lower revenue and improved
collections as well as lower expenses of 01 billion resulting from the
deconsolidation of our att latin america subsidiary these declines were
partially offset by 02 billion due to the impact of a weak us dollar and
01 billion of increased postretirement and pension costs resulting from a
lower expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the effects of lower
actual plan assets

     selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased 08 billion
or 111 in 2004 compared with 2003 the decline was primarily attributable to
cost control efforts throughout att as well as reduced customer care volumes
at att consumer services resulting from a reduction in the number of
residential customers impacted in part by our strategic decision in the third
quarter of 2004 to shift our focus away from traditional consumer services
totaling 06 billion cost control efforts included headcount reductions as
well as continued process improvements the yearoveryear decline also
reflected 02 billion of lower marketing and acquisition spending as a result
of our change in strategy somewhat offset by increased advertising and
marketing spending on new initiatives primarily our voice over internet
protocol voip offering these declines were partially offset by a 50 million
legal accrual recorded in 2004 associated with the settlement of an att
shareholder class action lawsuit see note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information

     we expect sga expenses will continue to decline in 2005 primarily as a
result of headcount reductions and other cost reduction efforts as well as
lower advertising and marketing spending primarily due to our decision in 2004
to stop investing in traditional consumer services

     sga expenses decreased 06 billion or 76 in 2003 compared with 2002
the decline was primarily attributable to cost control efforts throughout att
as well as reduced customer care volumes at att consumer services resulting
from a reduction in the number of residential customers totaling 06 billion
cost control efforts included headcount reductions lower long distance and
brand advertising and promotional spending and other process improvements in
addition expenses decreased 01 billion in connection with the deconsolidation
of att latin america such declines were partially offset by 01 billion of
increased pension and postretirement costs primarily resulting from a lower
expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in 2003 and the effects of
lower actual plan assets as well as approximately 01 billion of increased
marketing customer care and sales expenses associated with new local service
offerings by att consumer services

     depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 11 billion or 226 in
2004 compared with 2003 the decrease was primarily attributable to asset
impairment charges of 114 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2004 which
decreased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately 11 billion

     in 2005 we expect depreciation and amortization expenses to decrease
compared with 2004 as a result of the full year impact of the asset impairment
charges recorded in the third quarter of 2004 and reduced levels of capital
expenditures in recent years

     depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 18 million or 04 in
2003 compared with 2002 the decreases were primarily due to the adoption of
sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations lower depreciation
associated with our att latin america subsidiary which was classified as an
asset held for sale in december 2002 and lower asset impairments in 2003 these
declines were largely offset by an increase in the asset base

     total capital expenditures were 18 billion 34 billion and 39 billion
for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the 2003 amount includes 04 billion
recorded in connection with the adoption of financial accounting standards board

decreases in expenditures reflect the completion in prior years of

capital spending primarily associated with meeting customer demands and process
improvements on our advanced services offerings of ipe services and data
services both of which include managed services we expect capital expenditures
to be approximately 15 billion in 2005

     asset impairment and net restructuring and other charges of 128 billion
for 2004 were comprised of 115 billion of asset impairment charges and 13
billion of net business restructuring and other obligations charges in the
amount of 120 billion were recorded in att business services 02 billion in
att consumer services and 06 billion in the corporate and other group

     the asset impairment charges of 115 billion primarily reflect third
quarter asset impairments of 114 billion as a result of an evaluation of our
longlived assets including property plant and equipment and internaluse
software the asset group in addition we recorded real estate impairment
charges of 01 billion related to the decision made during the first quarter of
2004 to divest five owned properties in an effort to further reduce costs and
consolidate our real estate portfolio the impairment charge was recorded to
reduce the book value of the five properties to fair market value based on third
party assessments including broker appraisals the sales of these properties
have been completed

     the third quarter evaluation resulted from the july 2004 announcement of a
strategic change in our business focus away from traditional consumer services
and towards business markets and emerging technologies we performed an
evaluation of the asset group as of july 1 2004 as this strategic change
created a triggering event necessitating such a review in assessing
impairments for longlived assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 144 we
operate an integrated telecommunications network therefore we performed our
testing of the asset group at the reporting unit level as this is the lowest
level for which identifiable cash flows are available

     in performing the test we determined that the total of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows directly related to the existing service potential of
the asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group therefore
an impairment charge was required the impairment charges of 114 billion
represented the difference between the fair value of the asset group and its
carrying value the impairment charges resulted from sustained pricing pressure
and the evolution of services toward newer technologies in the business market
as well as changes in the regulatory environment which led to a shift away from
traditional consumer services

     att business services recorded impairment charges of 113 billion
resulting in reductions to property plant and equipment of 110 billion
internaluse software of 03 billion other purchased intangibles of 15
million and other longlived assets of 5 million att consumer services
recorded impairment charges of 59 million resulting in reductions to property
plant and equipment of 11 million and internaluse software of 48 million

     we calculated the fair value of our asset group using discounted cash
flows the discounted cash flows calculation was made utilizing various
assumptions and estimates regarding future revenue expenses and cash flows
projections through 2012 the time horizon was determined based on the estimated
remaining useful life of the primary assets in the asset group the primary
assets are those from which the most significant cash flows are generated
principally consisting of the transport central office equipment pursuant to
sfas no 144 the forecasts were developed without contemplation of investments
in new products the 10 discount rate utilized was determined using a weighted
average cost of capital debt and equity and was more heavily weighted towards
debt given that the asset group which primarily consists of tangible assets
can be financed with a larger proportion of debt when allocating the impairment
to the asset categories market values were utilized to the extent
determinable to ensure that no asset category was impaired below its fair
value

     the strategic change in business focus also created a triggering event
for a review of our goodwill we follow the provisions of sfas no 142 for
determining impairments sfas no 142 indicates that if other

                                        36

types of assets in addition to goodwill of a reporting unit are being tested
for impairment at the same time as goodwill then those assets are to be tested
for impairment prior to performing the goodwill impairment testing accordingly
the impairment charges noted above reduced the carrying value of the reporting
units when performing the impairment test for goodwill

     the goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our
overall business enterprise at the reporting unit level our reporting units are
att business services and att consumer services we estimated fair value using
both a discounted cash flows model as well as an approach using market
comparables both of which are weighted equally to determine fair value under
the discounted cash flows method we utilized estimated longterm revenue and
cash flow forecasts as well as assumptions of terminal value together with an
applicable discount rate to determine fair value under the market approach
fair value was determined by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses
or guideline companies we then compared the carrying value of our reporting
units to their fair value since the fair value of our reporting units exceeded
their carrying amounts no goodwill impairment charge was recorded

     the net restructuring and other obligations of 13 billion for 2004 were
primarily comprised of 12 billion of net employee separations of which 03
billion related to benefit plan curtailment costs and 01 billion of facility
closing obligations the exit plans will impact approximately 12600 employees
the majority of which will be involuntary across the company these activities
resulted from the continued integration and automation of various functions
within network operations reorganizations throughout our nonus operations
and our strategic change in focus away from traditional consumer services and
towards business markets and emerging technologies approximately 60 of the
employees impacted by these exit plans are managers about 60 of the affected
employees had left their positions as of december 31 2004 we anticipate that
the remaining employees will exit our business by the end of 2005 these exit
plans did not yield cash savings net of severance benefit payouts or a benefit
to operating income net of the restructuring charges recorded in 2004
however we expect to realize approximately 12 billion of annual cash savings
and benefit to operating income in subsequent years upon completion of the exit
plans the facility closing reserves were primarily associated with the
consolidation of our real estate portfolio and reflect the present value of
contractual lease obligations net of estimated sublease income associated with
vacant facilities resulting from workforce reductions and network equipment
space that will not be used

     as we continue to evaluate our cost structure and improve processes
further workforce reductions are anticipated to occur during 2005 and are
expected to result in the recognition of additional charges

     in 2003 net restructuring and other charges of 02 billion primarily
consisted of separation costs associated with our management realignment
efforts the net charge included 01 billion related to att business services
26 million related to att consumer services and 38 million related to the
corporate and other group the separations were involuntary and impacted
approximately 2000 managers these activities were partially offset by the
reversal of 17 million of excess vintage employee separation liabilities

     in 2002 asset impairment and net restructuring and other charges were 14
billion which included a 10 billion charge for the impairment of the net
assets of our consolidated subsidiary att latin america a 02 billion
impairment charge related to certain digital subscriber line dsl assets and
net business restructuring charges of 02 billion charges in the amount of
12 billion were recorded in att business services 02 billion were recorded
in att consumer services and 23 million were recorded in the corporate and
other group

     in december 2002 our board of directors approved a plan sell our
approximate 95 voting stake in att latin america on december 31 2002 we
signed a nonbinding term sheet for the sale of our shares within one year for a
nominal amount as a result of this action we recorded a 10 billion asset
impairment charge to write down att latin americas assets to fair value this
charge was recorded within our att business services segment

     the impairment charge of 02 billion recorded in 2002 relating to certain
dsl assets including internaluse software licenses and property plant and
equipment that would not be utilized as a result of changes to our dsl build
strategy instead of building dsl capabilities in all geographic areas initially
targeted we signed an agreement with covad communications to offer dsl services
over its network as a result the assets in these areas were impaired this
charge was recorded within our att consumer services segment

     net business restructuring and other charges of 02 billion recorded in
2002 consisted of new exit plans totaling 04 billion and reversals of
liabilities associated with prior years exit plans of 02 billion the new
plans primarily consisted of 03 billion for employee separation costs 28
million of which was recorded as a pension liability associated with management
employees to be separated in 2002 which was funded from the pension trust and
39 million of facility closing reserves these exit plans separated slightly
more than 4800 employees approximately onehalf of whom were management
employees the majority of these employee separations were involuntary and were
largely the result of improved processes and automation in the provisioning and
maintenance of services for business customers

     the 02 billion reversals primarily consisted of 01 billion of employee
separation costs approximately 48 million of which was reversed from the
pension liability and 26 million related to prior plan facility closings that
were deemed to be no longer necessary the reversals were primarily due to
managements determination that the restructuring plan established in the fourth
quarter of 2001 for certain areas of att business services including network
services needed to be modified given industry conditions at that time as well
as the redeployment of certain employees to different functions

     other expense income net in 2004 was expense of 01 billion compared
with income of 02 billion in 2003 the unfavorable variance of 03 billion
can primarily be attributed to 02 billion of higher losses associated with the
early repurchase of longterm debt in 2004 compared with 2003 additionally
investment related income declined 01 billion in 2004 compared with 2003 due
to lower market returns

     we continue to hold 05 billion of investments in leveraged leases
including leases of commercial aircraft which we lease to domestic airlines as
well as aircraft related companies should the financial difficulties in the
us airline industry lead to further bankruptcies or lease restructurings we
could record additional losses associated with our aircraft lease portfolio in
addition in the event of bankruptcy or renegotiation of lease terms if any
portion of the nonrecourse debt is canceled such amounts would result in
taxable income to att and accordingly a cash tax expense

     other expense income net in 2003 was income of 02 billion compared
with expense of 01 billion in 2002 the favorable variance of 03 billion can
primarily be attributed to 03 billion of lower impairment charges recorded in
2003 compared with 2002 in 2002 due to the occurrence of several airline
bankruptcies write downs were recorded on certain aircraft leases that are
accounted for as leveraged leases in 2003 ongoing difficulties in the airline
industry resulted in the write downs of the residual values of certain aircraft
the lower impairment charges related to these leases and aircraft in 2003
compared with 2002 favorably impacted other income by 02 billion in 2003
also in 2003 investmentrelated impairment charges declined 01 billion
primarily driven by the impairment of time warner telecom in 2002 our
investment in time warner telecom was subsequently sold in 2003 further
contributing to the favorable other income variance was higher
investmentrelated income of 01 billion largely reflecting improved market
returns on certain holdings partially offsetting these favorable variances were
losses of 01 billion on the early call and repurchase of longterm debt in
2003 this loss was comprised of 03 billion associated with the early call and

gain on the early retirement of exchangeable notes that were indexed to att
wireless common stock also offsetting the favorable variance was a decline in
settlements associated with business dispositions primarily reflecting
reimbursements from comcast corporation comcast in 2002 in connection with the
debt exchange completed in conjunction with the spinoff of att broadband

interest expense   803     1158     1448


     interest expense decreased 04 billion or 307 in 2004 compared with
2003 and decreased 03 billion or 200 in 2003 compared with 2002 the
declines were reflective of significant early debt redemptions and scheduled
debt maturities with minimal new debt issuances during 2004 and 2003 these
declines were partially offset by the impact of interest rate stepups on
certain bonds as a result of longterm debt rating downgrades



                                                           for the years ended december 31

benefit provision for income taxes   4560      816     1587
effective tax rate     413      303        560


     the effective tax rate is the benefit provision for income taxes as a
percentage of loss income from continuing operations before income taxes

     the 2004 effective tax benefit rate was positively impacted by
approximately 36 percentage points due to the reversal of the valuation
allowance we recorded in 2002 attributable to the book and tax basis difference
related to our investment in att latin america during 2004 the subsidiaries
of att latin america were sold to telefonos de mexico sa de cv or telmex
and the att latin america plan of liquidation became effective as a result
the associated valuation allowance was no longer required and we recorded an
income tax benefit of 04 billion in 2004

     the 2003 effective tax rate was positively impacted by approximately 53
percentage points due to the recognition of approximately 01 billion of tax
benefits associated with refund claims related to additional research and
experimentation tax credits generated in prior years which received
governmental approval in 2003 in addition the 2003 effective tax rate was
positively impacted by approximately 15 percentage points due to the
recognition of tax benefits in connection with the exchange and sale of our
remaining interest in att wireless common stock

     the 2002 effective tax rate was adversely impacted by approximately 149
percentage points due to the 10 billion impairment charge recorded in 2002
relating to our interest in att latin america for which no tax benefit was
recorded also negatively impacting the 2002 rate was the impact of att latin
americas losses from operations for which no tax benefit was recorded because
realization of a tax benefit was not likely to occur and the losses were not
includable in our consolidated income tax return



                                                           for the years ended december 31

     minority interest income represents the net losses attributable to the
equity that minority holders have in less than 100 owned consolidated
subsidiaries of att the income in 2002 relates primarily to att latin
america in december 2002 the losses attributable to the minority holders of
att latin america

losses of att latin america were no longer allocated to the minority holders
also in 2003 att latin america filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and the att
appointed members of the att latin america board of directors resigned this
resulted in the deconsolidation of att latin america

     net earnings losses related to equity investments which are recorded net
of income taxes were losses of 04 billion in 2002 primarily due to aftertax
charges of 04 billion 05 billion pretax related to the estimated loss on
our commitment to purchase the shares of att canada we did not own the charges
reflected further deterioration in the underlying value of att canada as well
as accretion of the floor price of our obligation to purchase att canada

gain on disposition of discontinued operations                     1324


     net loss from discontinued operations for 2003 reflected an estimated
cost related to potential legal liabilities for certain environmental cleanup
matters associated with ncr corp ncr which was spunoff from att in 1996
ncr was formally notified by federal and state agencies that it is a potentially
responsible party prp for environmental claims under the comprehensive
environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla and
other statutes arising out of the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs
in sediments in the lower fox river and in the bay of green bay in wisconsin
ncr was identified as a prp because of alleged pcb discharges from two
carbonless copy paper manufacturing facilities it previously owned which were
located along the fox river in july 2003 the government clarified its planned
approach for remediation of the contaminated sediments which caused ncr to
increase its estimated liability under the separation and distribution
agreement between att and ncr we are required to pay a portion of such costs
that ncr incurs above a certain threshold therefore in 2003 we recorded our
estimated proportionate share of certain costs associated with the fox river
matter which totaled 13 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis the
extent of ncrs potential liability is subject to numerous variables that are
uncertain at this time including the actual remediation costs and the
percentage ncr may ultimately be responsible for as a result our actual
liability may be different than the estimated amount pursuant to the separation
and distribution agreement ncr is liable for the first 100 million of costs in
connection with this liability we are liable for 37 of costs incurred by ncr
beyond such 100 million threshold all such amounts are determined after
reduction of any monies collected by ncr from other parties

     net loss from discontinued operations in 2002 includes a loss of 145
billion from the discontinued operations of att broadband which was primarily
comprised of the att broadband segment which was spunoff to att shareowners
on november 18 2002

     net loss from discontinued operations in 2002 also included an estimated
loss on the litigation settlement associated with the business of lucent
technologies inc lucent which was spunoff from att in 1996 and accounted
for as a discontinued operation sparks et al v att and lucent et al was a
class action lawsuit filed in 1996 in illinois state court on august 9 2002 a
settlement proposal was submitted to and accepted by the court we believe that
att and lucent have complied with all of the

terms and conditions of the settlement agreement and court order in accordance
with the separation and distribution agreement between att and lucent our
estimated proportionate share of the settlement and legal costs recorded in 2002
totaled 33 million after taxes 45 million pretax

     in 2002 we realized a noncash gain on the disposition of att broadband of
13 billion which represented the difference between the fair value of the
att broadband business at the date of the spinoff and our book value of att
broadband net of certain charges triggered by the spinoff of 02 billion and
the related income tax effect of 01 billion these charges included
compensation expense due to the accelerated vesting of stock options as well as
the enhancement of certain incentive plans

cumulative effect of accounting changes               15         856


     when we adopt new accounting standards issued by the fasb the impact if
any of changing from the previous accounting principle to the new accounting
principle is recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change

     effective july 1 2003 we early adopted fin no 46 consolidation of
variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin
arb no 51 resulting in a charge of 27 million net of income taxes of 17
million recognized as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the third
quarter of 2003 this interpretation requires the primary beneficiary to
consolidate a variable interest entity vie if it has a variable interest that
will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if they occur receive a
majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur or both based
on this standard two entities that we leased buildings from qualified as vies
and therefore were consolidated as of july 1 2003 later in 2003 we
exercised our purchase option on these buildings and therefore no longer have
an interest in these vies

     effective january 1 2003 we adopted sfas no 143 accounting for asset
retirement obligations resulting in 42 million of income net of income taxes
of 26 million as the cumulative effect of this accounting principle this
standard requires that obligations that are legally enforceable and unavoidable
and are associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets be
recorded as liabilities when those obligations are incurred with the amount of
the liability initially measured at fair value historically we included in our
group depreciation rates an amount related to the cost of removal for certain
assets however such amounts are not legally enforceable or unavoidable
therefore the cumulative effect impact primarily reflects the reversal of such
amounts accrued in accumulated depreciation at the time of adoption

     effective january 1 2002 we adopted sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 142 franchise costs were tested
for impairment as of january 1 2002 by comparing the fair value to the
carrying value at the market level as a result of this test an impairment
loss related to discontinued operations of 09 billion net of income taxes
of 05 billion was recorded in 2002

segment results

     our results are segmented according to the customers we service att
business services and att consumer services the balance of our continuing
operations are included in a corporate and other group this group primarily
reflects corporate staff functions and the elimination of transactions between
segments the discussion of segment results includes revenue operating loss
income capital additions and total assets

     operating income is the primary measure used by our chief operating
decision makers to measure our operating results and to measure segment
profitability and performance see note 15 to our consolidated financial
statements for a reconciliation of segment results to consolidated results

     total assets for each segment include all assets except intercompany
receivables nearly all prepaid pension assets taxes and corporateowned or
leased real estate are held at the corporate level and therefore are included
in the corporate and other group a substantial majority of our property plant
and equipment including network assets is included in the att business
services segment the net loss from discontinued operations is not reflected
in the corporate and other group capital additions for each segment include
capital expenditures for property plant and equipment additions to
internaluse software and additions to nonconsolidated investments

     our existing segments reflect certain managerial changes that were
implemented during 2004 the changes primarily include the transfer of our
remaining payphone business from the att consumer services segment to the att
business services segment

     we continually review our management model and structure which may result
in additional adjustments to our operating segments in the future

revenue

     att business services revenue decreased 25 billion or 99 in 2004
compared with 2003 and decreased 16 billion or 60 in 2003 compared with
2002 the decrease in both periods reflects continued pricing pressure and
declines in retail volumes as well as terminations and reductions in scope of
outsourcing contracts these declines were partially offset by growth in
wholesale volumes and strength in ipe services and local services the local
services growth in 2004 was positively impacted by a reciprocal compensation
settlement revenue growth in 2003 was negatively impacted by att latin
america which was fully consolidated in 2002 but not in 2003

     long distance voice revenue declined 17 billion or 150 in 2004
compared with 2003 and declined 12 billion or 94 in 2003 compared with
2002 the decline in both periods was driven by decreases in the average price
per minute in both the retail and wholesale businesses combined with a decline
in retail volumes reflecting the impacts of competition and product
substitution which has led to a loss of market share in the small and
mediumsized business markets partially offsetting these declines was an
increase in lowerpriced wholesale minutes although the rate of growth in 2004
was significantly lower than the rate in 2003 total long distance volumes were
essentially flat in 2004 and grew approximately 11 in 2003

     data services revenue declined 09 billion or 122 in 2004 compared
with 2003 and declined 05 billion or 64 in 2003 compared with 2002 the
declines were primarily driven by competitive pricing pressure weak demand and
technology migration primarily in data bandwidth and packet services in both
2004 and 2003 as well as weak demand in international managed data services in
2003 the acceleration in the rate of decline in 2004 compared with the rate in
2003 is reflective of the aggressive pricing environment which led to an
increased level of price competition in 2004

     ipe services revenue increased 02 billion or 110 in 2004 compared
with 2003 and rose 03 billion or 172 in 2003 compared with 2002 the
increase in 2004 is primarily attributed to a growth in advanced services such
as enhanced virtual private network evpn and ipenabled frame both of these
products are technologically superior to data bandwidth and packet services
products and reflect customer migration to better technology the increase in
2003 was primarily due to growth in managed internet services an increased
customer base associated with web hosting and growth in evpn excluding
equipment and product sales ipe services revenue grew 118 and 158 in 2004
and 2003 respectively

     outsourcing professional services and other revenue declined 03 billion
or 116 in 2004 compared with 2003 and declined 05 billion or 169 in
2003 compared with 2002 the decline in both periods was primarily due to
customers terminating outsourcing contracts and reducing the scope of contracts
the 2003 decline also reflects the impact of att latin america which was
consolidated in 2002 but not in 2003

     local voice services revenue grew 02 billion or 127 in 2004 compared
with 2003 and grew 03 billion or 284 in 2003 compared with 2002 revenue
for 2004 was positively impacted by a 97 million reciprocal compensation
settlement revenue generated when local exchange carriers use our local network
to terminate calls excluding this settlement local services revenue grew 62
in 2004 the growth in 2004 primarily reflects growth in our all in one bundle
offer however the rate of growth in this offer has declined compared with 2003
as a result of increased price competition and our decision to begin scaling
back our marketing efforts in the small business markets which primarily
impacts local voice revenue the growth in 2003 reflects our continued focus on
increasing the utilization of our existing footprint there were approximately
47 million 45 million and 36 million access lines in service at the end of
2004 2003 and 2002 respectively

     in 2005 we expect to see continued pricing pressure in retail and
wholesale voice and data services which will more than offset the anticipated
growth in wholesale volumes in addition as we continue to scale back our
marketing efforts we expect revenue from our small business customers to
decline several hundred million dollars in 2005 which will be primarily
reflected in local voice services revenue

 operating loss income

     operating loss income declined 120 billion in 2004 compared with 2003
primarily driven by 119 billion of higher asset impairment and net
restructuring and other charges resulting almost entirely from the third quarter
2004 asset impairment charges as a result of these asset impairment charges
2004 results include a 10 billion net benefit due to lower depreciation on the
impaired assets partially offset by lower networkrelated charges to att
consumer services in addition the 2004 operating loss reflects decreases in
long distance and data services resulting mainly from continued competitive
pricing pressures partially offset by ongoing cost control efforts

     in 2003 operating income declined 01 billion or 39 compared with
2002 primarily due to the decrease in the long distance voice business
resulting from the impact of continued declines in the average price per minute
and declining retail volumes tied to the weak economy and substitution the
decline in operating income was also impacted by a 01 billion access expense
adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2003 largely offsetting these
declines were lower asset impairment and net restructuring and other charges due
to the 10 billion 2002 att latin america impairment charge and ongoing cost
control efforts

     operating margin was 446 in 2004 76 in 2003 and 74 in 2002 asset
impairment and net restructuring and other charges negatively impacted the
operating margin by 487 05 and 45 percentage points in 2004 2003 and 2002
respectively excluding the impact of the charges the downward margin trend is
primarily reflective of the declining higher margin long distance retail voice
and data businesses coupled with a shift to lower margin products such as
advanced and wholesale services

     in 2005 we expect operating income and margin to continue to decline as a
result of the competitive pricing environment and the continued shift to lower
margin products despite our continued focus on reducing costs

  other items

     capital additions were 17 billion 32 billion and 37 billion in 2004
2003 and 2002 respectively capital additions continued to decline as a result
of our ongoing disciplined focus on capital spending during 2004 approximately
one third of our spending related to capitalized software as we continued to
invest in process improvements and initiatives to improve the customer
experience in addition we continued to invest in ipe services and data
services both of which included managed services

     total assets decreased 136 billion or 397 at december 31 2004
compared with december 31 2003 primarily driven by lower net property plant
and equipment as a result of asset impairment charges recorded in the third
quarter 2004 and depreciation expense for the year partially offset by capital
expenditures in addition total assets reflect lower accounts receivable
resulting from improved cash collections and revenue declines

compared with 2003 and declined 20 billion or 176 in 2003 compared with
2002 the decline in both periods was primarily due to standalone long distance
voice services which decreased 22 billion to 49 billion in 2004 and
declined 29 billion to 71 billion in 2003 largely due to the impact of
ongoing competition which has led to a loss of market share and substitution

impacted by the continued migration of customers to lower priced optional
calling plans and other products such as bundled services partially offsetting
the declines in standalone long distance voice services were pricing actions
taken including a monthly fee that we began billing in mid2003 to recover
costs including certain access and other connection charges and property taxes
partially offsetting the overall decline was an increase in bundled services
revenue which increased 07 billion and 09 billion in 2004 and 2003
respectively reflecting an increase in subscribers primarily due to penetration
in existing markets as well as entry into new markets the increase in bundled
services revenue includes amounts previously incorporated in standalone long
distance voice services revenue for existing customers that migrated to bundled
offers

     total long distance volumes including long distance volumes sold as part
of a bundle declined approximately 20 in 2004 and 17 in 2003 respectively
as a result of competition and wireless and internet substitution

     in 2004 nearly 5 of att consumer services total revenue and more than
50 of prepaid card revenue was related to a contract with walmart inc
walmart which was renewed on december 1 2004 if this contract is not
further renewed at the next renewal date december 31 2005 subject to early
termination if certain events occur att consumer services revenue would be
adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in selling the cards through a
different channel we are currently evaluating the prospective impact of the
february 2005 fcc prepaid card ruling and assessing whether we will pass the
related universal service fund costs to our customers in the event that we
decide to increase our rates under certain circumstances walmart may choose
to terminate this contract however we have the right to match any offer made
by a competitor and continue the existing contract

     as a result of changes in regulatory policy governing local telephone
service in 2004 we announced we will be shifting our focus away from
traditional consumer services such as residential telephone services and we
will no longer invest to acquire new residential local and long distance
customers we will continue to provide our existing customers with quality
service as a result of this announcement and the continued negative impacts of
competition including the continued penetration of regional bell operating
companies into the long distance market substitution and customer migration to
lowerpriced calling plans and products we expect att consumer services
revenue decline to accelerate in 2005

  operating income

     operating income declined 12 billion or 595 in 2004 compared with
2003 and declined 05 billion or 205 in 2003 compared with 2002 operating
margin declined to 105 in 2004 from 219 in 2003 and 226 in 2002 as a
result of the february 2005 fcc ruling operating income for 2004 included 06
billion of domestic access charges relating to our enhanced prepaid card
service which negatively impacted the operating margin by 70 percentage points
see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information operating income for 2004 also included asset impairment and net
restructuring and other charges of 189 million compared with 26 million in
2003 and 211 million in 2002 as a result of the third quarter 2004 asset
impairment charges operating income for 2004 included a 76 million benefit due
to lower depreciation on assets impaired by att consumer services as well as
lower networkrelated charges from att business services the 2004 asset
impairment and net restructuring and other charges negatively impacted the
operating margin by 15 percentage points excluding the impacts of the access
charges accrued in connection with our enhanced prepaid card service and the
asset impairment and net restructuring and other charges the operating margin
declines were primarily due to lower revenue coupled with increased local
connectivity expenses in both years during 2004 costs of services and products
and selling general and administrative expenses experienced a greater rate of
decline than revenue reflecting the impact of cost controls and lower marketing
and customer acquisition spending as a result of our strategic decision in the
third quarter of 2004 to shift our focus away from traditional consumer
services during 2003 selling general

 revenue

     corporate and other revenue was negative 03 billion in 2002 primarily
due to eliminations of internal revenue prior to the spinoff of att broadband
in november 2002

 operating loss

     in 2004 operating loss was 08 billion compared with 03 billion
in 2003 the increase in operating loss was primarily due to higher asset
impairment and net restructuring and other charges of 05 billion primarily
due to 04 billion of higher benefit plan curtailment and employee separation
costs as well as 01 billion of real estate impairment charges to writedown
heldforsale facilities all of which have been sold

     in 2005 we expect up to 02 billion of incremental expenses in corporate
and other excluding any net restructuring charges primarily related to higher
pension plan costs

     in 2003 operating loss was 03 billion compared with 02 billion
in 2002 this increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit
costs reflecting higher postretirement and pension expense driven in part by a
lower expected rate of return on plan assets the effects of lower actual plan
assets and a lower discount rate these increases were partially offset by
transaction costs associated with atts restructuring recorded in 2002 and an
asset impairment charge recorded in 2002

     total assets decreased 152 billion or 316 to 328 billion at
december 31 2004 compared with 480 billion at december 31 2003 largely
driven by a reduction in property plant and equipment of 129 billion
resulting from asset impairment charges and depreciation during the year
partially offset by capital expenditures in addition exclusive of a 07
billion reclassification of restricted cash and hedge receivable to other
current assets relating to debt maturing in 2005 other assets declined 12
billion primarily due to a decrease in internaluse software resulting from
amortization during the year and an impairment charge partially offset by
capital additions additionally other assets declined due to the settlement of
foreign currency swaps associated with euro debt repurchases accounts
receivable declined 08 billion driven by improved cash collections and lower
revenue also contributing to the decline in total assets was a decrease in cash
and cash equivalents of 07 billion see liquidity for a discussion of the
decline in cash and cash equivalents

     total liabilities decreased 82 billion or 242 to 258 billion at
december 31 2004 from 340 billion at december 31 2003 the decrease was due
in part to a 40 billion reduction in deferred income taxes primarily
associated with the tax benefit recorded for the impairments of property plant
and equipment and internaluse software during the year the decrease in total
liabilities was also largely attributable to lower debt balances of 37
billion reflecting the early retirement of 27 billion face value of debt and
04 billion of associated marktomarket adjustments coupled with scheduled
repayments of debt amounting to 12 billion partially offset by a 04 billion
increase in shortterm borrowings accounts payable and accrued expenses
declined 05 billion due to lower yearend capital and other accruals
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in total shortterm and
longterm compensation and benefitrelated liabilities of 02 billion
primarily attributable to higher net reserves for employee separations
partially offset by a reduction in other accruals

     total shareowners equity decreased 69 billion or 497 to 70 billion
at december 31 2004 from 140 billion at december 31 2003 this decrease was
primarily due to the net loss for the year largely driven by the asset
impairment charges recorded coupled with dividends declared

billion in 2004 a decline of 30 billion from 85 billion in 2003 driven in
part by the declining standalone long distance voice and data businesses this
downward trend in cash generated by operating activities was also impacted by
income taxes specifically 25 million of payments in 2004 compared with 12
billion of refunds in 2003 favorably impacting cash flows in 2004 compared with
2003 was our continued focus on streamlining our processes and controlling
costs as well as a 04 billion decline in interest payments primarily
resulting from our ongoing deleveraging efforts

     net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 85
billion in 2003 a decline of 20 billion from 105 billion in 2002 this is
reflective of the decline in our standalone long distance voice and data
businesses this decline was partially offset by a 04 billion increase in
income tax receipts and a 03 billion decline in interest payments resulting
from our ongoing deleveraging efforts our continued focus on streamlining our
processes and controlling costs also offset this decline

     our investing activities of continuing operations resulted in a net use of
cash of 17 billion in 2004 compared with 31 billion in 2003 and 14 billion
in 2002 during 2004 we spent 18 billion on capital expenditures during
2003 we spent 32 billion on capital expenditures made payments of 02
billion to british telecommunications plc bt primarily associated with assets
we assumed that bt originally contributed to our concert joint venture and
received 01 billion of proceeds from the sale of our remaining att wireless
shares during 2002 we spent 39 billion on capital expenditures paid 34
billion to settle the att canada obligation and received a 58 billion
distribution from att broadband in conjunction with its spinoff the declining
trend in capital expenditures reflects the completion in prior years of
infrastructure related projects and focused spending on advanced services

     during 2004 net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations
was 45 billion compared with 91 billion in 2003 and 60 billion in 2002
during 2004 we made net payments of 42 billion to reduce debt including
redemption premiums and foreign currency marktomarket revaluations primarily
due to our ongoing deleveraging efforts and paid dividends of 08 billion
included in other financing activities was the receipt of approximately 05
billion for the settlement of combined interest rate foreign currency swap
agreements in conjunction with the early repayment of euro notes in 2004 such
repayment is included as retirement of longterm debt

     in 2003 we made net payments of 93 billion to reduce debt including
early termination of debt and paid dividends of 06 billion reflected as an
other financing item was the receipt of approximately 02 billion cash
collateral related to favorable positions of certain combined interest rate
foreign currency swap agreements as well as 05 billion for the settlement of
a combined interest rate foreign currency swap agreement in conjunction with the
scheduled repayment of euro debt in november 2003 such repayment is included as
retirement of longterm debt during 2002 we made net payments of 82 billion
to reduce debt paid dividends of 06 billion and received 27 billion from
the issuance of att common stock primarily due to the sale of 46 million
shares in the second quarter of 2002 the proceeds of which were used in october
2002 to settle a portion of our obligation to the att canada shareholders

  working capital and other sources of liquidity

     at december 31 2004 our working capital ratio current assets divided by
current liabilities was 103

     at december 31 2004 we had a 10 billion syndicated 364day credit
facility available to us that was entered into on october 6 2004 no borrowings
are currently outstanding under the facility up to 05 billion of the facility
can be utilized for letters of credit which reduces the amount available at
december 31 2004 approximately 02 billion of letters of credit were
outstanding under the facility additionally the credit facility contains
financial covenants that require us to meet a total debttoebitda defined as
operating income plus depreciation and amortization excluding any asset
impairment or net restructuring and other charges ratio not exceeding 225 to 1
calculated pursuant to the credit facility and an ebitdatonet interest
expense ratio of at least 350 to 1 calculated pursuant to the credit facility
for four consecutive quarters ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter at
december 31 2004 we were in compliance with these covenants

     during 2004 we renewed our att consumer services and att business
services 364day customer accounts receivable securitization facilities both of
which extend through july 2005 together the programs provided up to 135
billion of available financing at december 31 2004 limited by the eligible
receivables balance which varies from month to month proceeds from the
securitizations are recorded as borrowings and are included in shortterm debt
approximately 03 billion was outstanding at december 31 2004 the facilities
require us to meet a debttoebitda ratio not exceeding 225 to 1 calculated
pursuant to the agreements and an ebitdatonet interest expense ratio not
exceeding 350 to 1 calculated pursuant to the agreements for four consecutive
quarters ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter at december 31 2004 we
were in compliance with these covenants

     we anticipate continuing to fund our operations in 2005 primarily with cash
from operations as well as cash and cash equivalents on hand however we
expect cash from operations to decline in 2005 compared with 2004 if
competition and product substitution accelerate beyond current expectations
andor economic conditions worsen or do not improve our cash flows from
operations would decrease negatively impacting our liquidity however we
believe our access to the capital markets is adequate to provide the flexibility
we desire in funding our operations sources of liquidity in addition to our
substantial cash and cash equivalents on hand include 24 billion remaining
under a universal shelf registration the 135 billion securitization program
limited by eligible receivables and the 10 billion credit facility in
light of the third quarter 2004 shortterm credit rating downgrades discussed
below there is no longer any assurance that we will continue to have any
significant access to the commercial paper market in addition based on our
request standard  poors sp and moodys investors services inc moodys
have withdrawn our shortterm credit ratings the maximum amount of commercial
paper outstanding during 2004 was approximately 10 billion at december 31
2004 there was no commercial paper outstanding we cannot provide any
assurances that any or all of these sources of funding will be available at the
time they are needed or in the amounts required the sbc merger agreement
provides that we cannot incur additional indebtedness over 100 million in the
aggregate or issue equity or convertible securities without the prior consent of
sbc without limitation this could materially limit our ability to make
drawings under our 1 billion credit facility to increase the amount of our
financing of accounts receivable under our securitization facility to issue
commercial paper or to utilize our universal shelf registration statement for
financing purposes in addition the merger agreement requires us to pay a
special dividend in excess of 10 billion in connection with the closing of the
transaction the combination of the requirement to reserve cash to pay the
special dividend and the restriction on our ability to utilize sources of
liquidity could have a material adverse affect on our liquidity position
however we expect to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand and cash from
operations to fund all liquidity needs including the special dividend and
announced debt buyback see subsequent events through the expected closing of
the merger without any additional borrowings or financings

  credit ratings and related debt implications

     during the third quarter of 2004 our longterm and shortterm credit
ratings were lowered by sp moodys and fitch ratings fitch as reflected in
the table below the rating actions by sp and moodys triggered a 100 basis
point interest rate stepup on approximately 64 billion in original face value
of debt outstanding as of december 31 2004 current carrying value of 67
billion this stepup was effective for interest payment periods that began in
november 2004 which resulted in increased interest expense of approximately 8
million in 2004 the interest rate stepups are expected to increase interest
expense by approximately 67 million in 2005 as of december 31 2004 our
credit ratings were as follows



credit rating agency                        shortterm rating   longterm rating   outlook
                              
                                                                          
standard  poors          b                 bb          negative

moodys         nr                 ba1          negative


     as a result of the sbc merger announcement on january 31 and february 1
2005 fitch and sps respectively put our longterm debt ratings on watch
positive and removed the outlook negative on january 31 2005 moodys
placed our longterm debt rating on review for possible upgrade and removed the
outlook negative in addition based on our request sp and moodys withdrew
our shortterm credit ratings

     our access to capital markets as well as the cost of our borrowings are
affected by our debt ratings the third quarter rating actions discussed above
and further debt rating downgrades will require us to pay higher rates on
certain existing debt and have required us to post cash collateral for certain
interestrate swaps in which we were in a net payable position

     additionally if our debt ratings are further downgraded our access to the
capital markets may be further restricted andor such replacement financing may
be more costly or have additional covenants than we had in connection with our
debt at december 31 2004 in addition the market environment for financing in
general and within the telecommunications sector in particular has been
adversely affected by economic conditions and bankruptcies of other
telecommunications providers

     att corp is generally the obligor for debt issuances however there are
some instances in which att corp is not the obligor for example the
securitization facilities and certain capital leases the total debt of these
entities which are fully consolidated is approximately 04 billion at
december 31 2004 and is included within shortterm and longterm debt

  cash requirements

     our cash needs for 2005 will be primarily related to capital expenditures
repayment of debt the payment of dividends and income tax related payments we
expect our capital expenditures in 2005 will be approximately 15 billion in
addition we expect income tax payments will be significantly higher in 2005
compared with 2004

     att anticipates contributing approximately 05 billion to the us
postretirement benefit plans in 2005 we expect to contribute approximately 30
million to our us nonqualified pension plan in 2005 no contribution is
expected for our us qualified pension plans in 2005

  contractual cash obligations

     the following summarizes atts contractual cash obligations and commercial
commitments at december 31 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected
to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods included in the table
below are purchase obligations under which we have legal obligations for

payments in specific years the minimum commitment for certain obligations is
based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contract since
termination penalties would not be paid in every year such penalties are
excluded from the table see notes 2 and 3 to the table other longterm
liabilities were included in the table based on the year of required payment or
an estimate of the year of payment such estimate of payment is based on a
review of past trends for these items as well as a forecast of future
activities certain items were excluded from the table below as the year of
payment is unknown and could not be reliably estimated since past trends were
not deemed to be an indicator of future payment see note 4 to the table

1 impact of discounts and derivative instruments included in debt amounts on
    the balance sheet are excluded from the table these debt amounts include
    revaluations on our foreign currency denominated debt of 03 billion in
    both 2005 and 2006 we have entered into foreign exchange contracts
    recorded in other current assets and other assets which hedge our exposure
    to these foreign currency revaluations

2 we have contractual obligations to utilize network facilities from local
    exchange carriers with terms greater than one year since the contracts have
    no minimum volume requirements and are based on an interrelationship of
    volumes and discounted rates we assessed our minimum commitment based on
    penalties to exit the contracts assuming we exited the contracts on
    december 31 2004 at december 31 2004 the penalties we would have
    incurred to exit all of these contracts would have been 13 billion such
    termination penalties decline throughout the lives of the contracts and
    could be 09 billion in 2005 09 billion in the aggregate for 2006 and
    2007 and 02 billion in the aggregate for 2008 and 2009 assuming all
    contracts are exited these termination fees are excluded from the above
    table as the fees would not be paid in every year and the timing of such
    payments if any is uncertain

3 we calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase
    goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the
    contract if we elect to exit these contracts termination fees for all such
    contracts in the year of termination could be approximately 467 million in
    2005 421 million in the aggregate for 2006 and 2007 68 million in the
    aggregate for 2008 and 2009 or 1 million in the aggregate thereafter
    these termination fees are excluded from the above table as the fees would
    not be paid in every year and the timing of such payments if any is
    uncertain

4 other longterm liabilities of 16 billion and deferred income taxes of
    14 billion have been excluded from the above table due to the uncertainty
    of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trending
    to be used as a predictor for such payments also longterm liabilities
    totaling 06 billion have been excluded from the above table as settlement
    of such liabilities will not require the use of cash

5 certain longterm benefitrelated liabilities including pensions
    postretirement health and welfare benefits and postemployment benefit
    obligations are appropriately recorded on the balance sheet at present
    value the accrued liability which is impacted by various actuarial
    assumptions will differ from the sum of future value of estimated payments
    estimated payments including payments to fund the benefit trusts are 12
    billion in the aggregate for 2006 and 2007 11 billion in the aggregate
    for 2008 and 2009 and 60 billion thereafter and differs from the
    obligation recognized on the balance sheet by 50 billion although we
    provide various employee benefit plans programs and arrangements to our
    employees we reserve the right to amend modify or terminate these plans
    programs or arrangements at any time subject to the terms and conditions of
    such plans programs or arrangements and applicable law accordingly these
    amounts have been excluded from the above table as we are not legally
    obligated for such cash outflows see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated
    financial statements for additional information

  other commercial commitments

     in certain circumstances we guarantee the debt and other obligations of our
subsidiaries and in connection with the separation of certain subsidiaries
these guarantees remained outstanding at december 31 2004 these guarantees
relate to our former subsidiaries att broadband and ncr

     we currently hold no collateral for such guarantees and have not recorded
corresponding obligations we have been provided with crossguarantees or
indemnifications by third parties for certain of these guarantees in the event
that the financial condition of the parties to the various agreements
deteriorates to the point at which they declare bankruptcy other third parties
to the agreements could look to us for payment

     prior to the spinoff of att broadband we had guaranteed various
obligations of att broadband including operating leases for real estate
surety bonds and equity hedges which we continue to provide comcast has
provided indemnifications for the full amount of these guarantees such
commitments total 339 million and are expected to expire as follows 137
million in 2005 and 202 million in the aggregate in 2006 and 2007

     the total amount of guaranteed debt at december 31 2004 was 56 million
such debt guarantees relate to ncr with the substantial portion of the debt
maturing subsequent to 2009

employee benefit plans

     we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering the
majority of our us employees our postretirement benefit plans for current and
certain future retirees include healthcare benefits life insurance coverage
and telephone concessions

     in 2004 we contributed 36 million and 611 million out of operating cash
to fund the nonqualified pension and postretirement plans respectively in
2005 we anticipate contributing approximately 30 million to the nonqualified
pension plans and while not required approximately 525 million to the
postretirement plans we were not required to contribute to the qualified
pension plans in 2004 and we do not anticipate any required contributions in
2005 contributions for 2006 and beyond cannot be estimated at this time due to
the uncertainty regarding various factors that determine the contributions for
those years these factors include the actual return on plan assets in the
future the level of interest rates in the future future salary increases and
future demographic experience

     plan assets are held in trust for the participants consistent with the
plans investment policies assets are invested in equity securities debt
securities and real estate investment securities are exposed to various risks
including interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks as a result
of these risks it is reasonably possible that the market values of investment
securities could increase or decrease in the near term which could affect the
value of the trusts and as a result the future level of pension and
postretirement plan expense see note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements for further details on our investments and investment strategy

demographics of the plan participants see critical accounting estimates and
judgments for a discussion of the material assumptions used in determining the
pension and postretirement obligations and a sensitivity analysis on the
assumptions in addition changes in the assumptions themselves can result in
gain or loss recognition gains and losses are amortized into cost to the extent
that they exceed a prescribed amount the portion of the accumulated net gains
or losses that exceeds 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan
assets or the projected benefit obligation is amortized over the
weightedaverage remaining service life of the plan participants which was 97
years for our pension and postretirement plans as of december 31 2004 as such
significant portions of benefit costs recorded in any period may not reflect the
actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants

     as of december 31 2004 the unrecognized net losses for the pension and
postretirement benefit plans were approximately 23 billion unrecognized net
losses and gains result from changes in the expected projected benefit
obligation or plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed
and from any changes in assumptions during 2004 the unrecognized net losses
were reduced by an asset gain of approximately 07 billion primarily resulting
from actual 2004 pension asset returns of approximately 13 compared with an
85 expected return on assets partially offsetting this decrease were net
actuarial losses of approximately 05 billion primarily due to the 25 basis
point decline in the discount rate

risk management

     we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest and foreign currency
exchange rates as well as changes in equity prices associated with previously
affiliated companies in addition we were exposed to market risk from
fluctuations in the prices of securities on a limited basis we use certain
derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps foreign
currency exchange contracts combined interest rate foreign currency contracts
options forwards equity hedges and other derivative contracts to manage these
risks we do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
all financial instruments are used in accordance with boardapproved policies

     we enter into foreign currency contracts to minimize our exposure to risk
of adverse changes in currency exchange rates we are subject to foreign
exchange risk for foreign currencydenominated transactions such as debt
issued recognized payables and receivables and forecasted transactions at
december 31 2004 our foreign currency exposures were principally euros
british pound sterling danish krone and swiss francs

     the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is subject to the changes in
foreign currency exchange rates for the purpose of assessing specific risks we
use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures
may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of
operations to perform the sensitivity analysis we assess the risk of loss in
fair values from the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in the value of foreign
currencies positive change in the value of the us dollar assuming no change
in interest rates see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information relating to notional amounts and fair values of financial
instruments

     for foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december 31 2004 and 2003
assuming a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar against foreign
currencies from the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates the fair value
of the foreign exchange contracts net asset would have decreased 37 million
and 77 million respectively because our foreign exchange contracts are
entered into for hedging purposes we believe that these losses would be largely
offset by gains on the underlying transactions

     we have also entered into combined interest rate foreign currency contracts
to hedge foreign currencydenominated debt at december 31 2004 and 2003
assuming a hypothetical 10 appreciation in the us dollar against foreign
currencies from the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates the fair value
of the combined interest rate foreign currency contracts net asset would have
decreased 02 billion and

          financial condition and results of operations  continued

04 billion respectively because our foreign exchange contracts are entered
into for hedging purposes we believe that these losses would be largely offset
by gains on the underlying foreign currencydenominated debt

     the model to determine sensitivity assumes a parallel shift in all foreign
currency exchange rates although exchange rates rarely move in the same
direction additionally the amounts above do not necessarily represent the
actual changes in fair value we would incur under normal market conditions
because all variables other than the exchange rates are held constant in the
calculations

     we use interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on
earnings and cash flows we perform a sensitivity analysis on our interest rate
swaps to assess the risk of changes in fair value the model to determine
sensitivity assumes a hypothetical 10 parallel shift in all interest rates at
december 31 2004 and 2003 assuming a hypothetical 10 increase in interest
rates the fair value of interest rate swaps net liability would have
increased by 8 million and 13 million respectively

     as discussed above we have also entered into combined interest rate
foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currencydenominated debt assuming
a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates the fair value of the contracts
net asset would have increased by 7 million and 33 million at december 31
2004 and 2003 respectively

     the fair value of our fixedrate longterm debt is sensitive to changes in
interest rates interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the
market value of the debt due to differences between the market interest rates
and rates at the inception of the obligation assuming a 10 upward shift in
interest rates at december 31 2004 and 2003 the fair value of unhedged debt
would have decreased by 04 billion in each year

     the risk of loss in fair values of all other financial instruments
resulting from a hypothetical 10 change in market prices was not significant as
of december 31 2004 and 2003

     in order to determine the changes in fair value of our various financial
instruments including options and other equity awards we use certain financial
modeling techniques we apply rate sensitivity changes directly to our interest
rate swap transactions and forward rate sensitivity to our foreign
currencyforward contracts

     the changes in fair value as discussed above assume the occurrence of
certain market conditions which could have an adverse financial impact on att
they do not consider the potential effect of changes in market factors that
would result in favorable impacts to us and do not represent projected gains or
losses in fair value that we expect to incur future impacts would be based on
actual developments in global financial markets we do not foresee any
significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk foreign
currency rate risk or equity price risk in the near future

     the sbc merger agreement prohibits us from entering into any additional
derivative financial instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding 100 million

accounting for stock issued to employees intrinsic value method of accounting
that was provided for in sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation
as originally issued effective january 1 2003 we adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of original sfas no 123 on a prospective basis and we
began to record stockbased compensation expense for all employee awards
including stock options granted or modified after january 1 2003 adoption of
the revised standard will require that we begin to recognize expense for
unvested awards issued prior to january 1 2003 additionally this standard
requires that estimated forfeitures be considered in determining compensation
expense for equity awards other than stock options we have not previously
included estimated forfeitures in determining compensation expense accordingly

date and the compensation expense as calculated considering estimated
forfeitures will be reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change upon
adoption further sfas no 123 revised 2004 requires that excess tax benefits
be recognized as an addition to paidin capital and amends sfas no 95
statement of cash flows to require that the excess tax benefits be reported
as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid sfas no
123 revised 2004 is effective for all awards granted after june 15 2005 and
to awards modified repurchased or cancelled after that date we intend to
elect a modified prospective adoption which will result in additional
compensation expense beginning in the third quarter of 2005

assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 29 apb opinion no 29 requires that
nonmonetary exchanges of assets be recorded at fair value with an exception for
exchanges of similar productive assets which can be recorded on a carryover
basis sfas no 153 eliminates the current exception and replaces it with a
general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
commercial substance a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the
future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result
of the exchange sfas no 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges that
take place in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 which is july 1
2005 for us however earlier application is permitted

 item 1 business general sbc communications inc sbc is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in 1983 and has its principal executive offices at 175 e houston san antonio texas 782052233 telephone number 2108214105 sbc maintains an internet site at httpwwwsbccom this web site address is for information only and is not intended to be an active link or to incorporate any web site information into this document we make available free of charge on our website our annual report on form 10k our quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the sec 

throughout this document sbc is referred to as “we” or “sbc” 

history 

sbc was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold att corp‘s att local telephone companies on january 1 1984 sbc was spunoff from att pursuant to an antitrust consent decree becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider at formation we primarily operated in five southwestern states sbc subsidiaries merged with pacific telesis group pac in 1997 southern new england telecommunications corporation snet in 1998 and ameritech corporation ameritech in 1999 thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier into a total of 13 states our services and products have been marketed under several brands including sbc ameritech sbc nevada bell sbc pacific bell sbc snet sbc southwestern bell and through our joint venture with bellsouth corporation bellsouth cingular wireless cingular in december 2002 in order to further establish the public’s awareness of sbc as a national telecommunications provider we moved our regional sbc brands to a single brand sbc for all states except connecticut 

scope 

we rank among the largest providers of telecommunications services in the united states and the world through our subsidiaries we provide communications services and products in the united states and have investments in more than 25 countries we offer our services and products to businesses and consumers as well as other providers of telecommunications services 

the services and products that we offer vary by market and include local exchange services wireless communications longdistance services internet services telecommunications equipment and directory advertising and publishing we group our operating subsidiaries as follows corresponding to our operating segments for financial reporting purposes 

wireline subsidiaries provide primarily land and wire based services wireless subsidiaries hold our investment in cingular which provides primarily radio wave based services directory subsidiaries provide services related to directory advertising and publishing international subsidiaries hold investments in primarily foreign entities outside of the united states and other subsidiaries provide corporate operations and prior to 2001 primarily provided security monitoring and cable television services our principal wireline subsidiaries provide telecommunications services in thirteen states california texas illinois michigan ohio missouri connecticut indiana wisconsin oklahoma kansas arkansas and nevada 13state area wireline local exchange services offered in the 13state area are provided through regulated subsidiaries which operate within authorized regions inregion subject to regulation by each state in which they operate and by the federal communications commission fcc additional information relating to regulation is contained under the heading “government regulation” below and in the 2002 sbc annual report to shareowners under the heading “operating environment and trends of the business” and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

interlata longdistance 

we offer landline interlata traditional longdistance services to customers in selected areas outside our wireline subsidiaries’ operating areas further we offer interlata wireline longdistance services to customers in texas kansas oklahoma arkansas missouri california and connecticut in december 2002 the public utilities commission of nevada approved our nevada wireline subsidiary’s application to enter the interlata longdistance market in nevada and we filed for approval from the fcc on january 14 2003 in january 2003 the michigan public service commission approved our michigan wireline subsidiary’s application to enter the interlata longdistance market in michigan and we filed for approval from the fcc on january 16 2003 the fcc must issue its decision within 90 days of our filings if it deems our filings complete finally we continue to seek longdistance approval in our other remaining inregion states and have filed applications with state commissions in illinois indiana ohio and wisconsin 

broadband initiative 

in october 1999 we announced plans to upgrade our network to make broadband services available to approximately 80 of our us wireline customers over the four years through 2003 project pronto due to the weakening us economy and an adverse regulatory environment in october 2001 we announced a scaleback in our broadband deployment plans specifically burdensome fcc and state commission regulations regarding our dsl network have added significantly to our costs and delayed our ability to earn a profit on dsl service our cable modem competitors are not subject to these regulations this adverse regulatory environment was the primary reason we decided to slow the buildout of our broadband network we expect to spend significantly less on capital expenditures due to this scaleback despite this scaleback our dsl lines continue to grow and were approximately 2199000 at december 31 2002 compared to 1333000 at the end of 2001 and we expect dsl to achieve profitability in early 2004 our addressable broadband market included 66 of our consumer and small business locations at december 31 2002 

the fcc began its review of the rules for the provision of domestic broadband services by incumbent local carriers or their affiliates in december 2001 the fcc is reviewing broadband services offered over cable satellite and wireless platforms in addition to traditional wireline offerings in february 2002 the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking tentatively concluding that wireline broadband access services are information services rather than telecommunications services which would result in less regulation the fcc also is considering eliminating the requirement that wireline telephone companies provide the transmission component of broadband internet access services as standalone telecommunications services and whether it should adopt an alternative broadband access requirement for internet service providers cable operators have no obligation to provide thirdparty internet service providers access to their broadband networks at this time although the fcc has initiated a proceeding to consider the issue 

in december 2002 the fcc ruled that advanced services such as dsl provided through one of our advanced services subsidiaries are not subject to tariff regulations and cost study requirements however we are still required to retain cost data and offer our retail advanced services for resale at a discount this ruling should allow us to respond more quickly to offerings by unregulated competitors the fcc is expected to complete its broadband review in mid2003 and the effect of the review on our results of operations and financial position cannot be determined at this time in a separate proceeding the fcc addressed other broadband issues see “fcc triennial review” in “recent developments” below 

wireless 

cingular our wireless joint venture with bellsouth began operations in october 2000 cingular serves approximately 22 million wireless cellular and pcs subscribers and is the secondlargest provider of mobile wireless voice and data communications services in the united states based on the number of wireless subscribers cingular has access to licenses to provide cellular or pcs wireless communications services covering an aggregate population of potential subscribers referred to as “pops” of approximately 231 million or approximately 81 of the us population including 45 of the 50 largest us metropolitan areas 

cingular’s priorities for 2003 include promotion of the cingular brand to expand its customer base profitably continued realization of revenue and cost synergies offered by its formation increasing the capacity speed and functionality of its network through the continued rollout of wireless data services by overlaying global system for mobile communications gsm voice which is the standard digital cellular phone technology used in europe and other countries around the world and general packet radio service gprs highspeed data technology over its existing networks development and promotion of advanced wireless data applications over multiple communications devices and continued expansion of its existing footprint and network capacity by obtaining access to additional spectrum primarily through spectrum exchanges purchases mergers or acquisitions 

business operations operating segments 

our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services and are managed accordingly as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap our operating segment results follow our internal management reporting we evaluate performance based on income before income taxes adjusted for special items we have five reportable segments that reflect the current management of our business 1 wireline 2 wireless 3 directory 4 international and 5 other 

additional information about our segments including financial information and special items is included under the heading “segment results” on pages 9 through 17 and in note 4 of the 2002 sbc annual report to shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

wireline 

wireline is our largest operating segment providing approximately 74 of 2002 revenues from all our segments our wireline segment operates as both a retail and wholesale seller of communication services we provide landline telecommunications services including local network access data longdistance services internet services and customer premises and private branch exchange pbx equipment our landline telecommunications subsidiaries serve approximately 314 million retail consumer 195 million retail business 57 million wholesale and 05 million other access lines for a total of 571 million access lines in our 13state area 

services and products 

we divide our wireline services into four productbased categories – voice data longdistance and other 

voice  voice includes traditional local service provided to retail customers and wholesale access to our network and individual network elements provided to competitors voice also includes vertical services described below fees to maintain wire located inside customer premises pay telephones and other miscellaneous voice products 

vertical services are enhanced telephone services available to retail customers such as caller id call waiting and voice mail customers that subscribe to these services can have the number andor name of callers displayed on their phone be signaled that additional calls are incoming and send and receive voice messages these services are not regulated by the fcc and are generally more profitable than basic local phone service 

data  data includes traditional products such as switched and dedicated transport internet access and network integration and data equipment sales 

switched transport services transmit data using switching equipment to transfer the data between multiple lines before reaching its destination dedicated transport services use a single direct line to transmit data between destinations integrated services digital network isdn dedicated frame relay dsl digital services and synchronous optical network sonet are examples of dedicated transport services isdn transmits voice video and data over a single line in support of a wide range of applications including internet access frame relay is a routing technology that breaks a data signal into individual pieces of data to travel at high speeds and then recombines the data prior to arriving at its destination dsl is a digital modem technology that converts existing twistedpair telephone lines into access paths for multimedia and highspeed data communications to the internet or private networks dsl allows customers to simultaneously make a phone call and access information via the internet or an office local area network digital services use dedicated digital circuits to transmit digital data at various high rates of speed sonet provides customer access to our backbone network at various high speeds 

network integration services include installation of business data systems local area networking and other data networking offerings internet access services include a wide range of products for residences and businesses varying by market internet services offered include basic dialup access service dedicated access web hosting email and highspeed access services 

prodigy acquisition 

during 2000 we formed a relationship with prodigy communications corporation prodigy that combined our residential and small business internet operations in the fourth quarter of 2001 we acquired prodigy additional financial information on the prodigy acquisition is contained in note 2 of the 2002 sbc annual report to shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

yahoo alliance 

in november 2001 we formed a strategic alliance with yahoo to provide cobranded broadband and dialup service to residential customers nationwide sbc and yahoo expanded the alliance in april 2002 to include cobranded broadband and dialup services designed for small businesses during the second quarter of 2002 the companies launched sbc yahoo dial  a national dialup internet service for residential users during the third quarter the companies launched sbc yahoo dsl for residential customers in sbc’s 13state region sbc and yahoo plan to launch cobranded services for small businesses in 2003 

cisco agreement 

in december 2002 we formed a strategic marketing and sales agreement with cisco systems inc cisco to provide business services that will combine cisco’s equipment and our transport and integration services we also intend to use select cisco technology in our network infrastructure to deliver new services customers will be able to costeffectively outsource these business services and sbc service centers will serve as a single point of contact 

longdistance voice  longdistance voice consists of all interlata traditional longdistance and intralata local toll wireline revenues including calling card and 1800 services federal regulation prohibits us from providing interlata wireline longdistance services in six of our 13 inregion states we provide interlata wireline longdistance to our customers in texas kansas oklahoma arkansas missouri california and connecticut in addition since 1996 we have offered interlata wireline longdistance services to customers in selected areas outside our 13state region 

other  customer premises equipment and other equipment sales range from singleline and cordless telephones to sophisticated digital pbx systems pbx is a private telephone switching system typically used by businesses and usually located on a customer’s premises which provides intrapremise telephone services as well as access to our network 

wireless 

our wireless segment provides domestic wireless telecommunications services including local longdistance and roaming services wireless services and products offered also include certain enhanced services paging services and wireless equipment due to the contribution of substantially all of our domestic wireless operations to cingular discussed below reported operating revenues and expenses do not include revenues or expenses from cingular instead we reflect our 60 share of its net income as equity in net income of affiliates consequently on a reported basis our wireless segment had no operating revenues 

while our reported operating revenues do not include cingular’s results we do include 60 of cingular’s revenues and expenses which equals our economic ownership percentage when we analyze our operating segment results on that segment basis the wireless segment provided approximately 17 of 2002 revenues from all our segments 

cingular wireless joint venture 

in april 2000 we formed a joint venture with bellsouth to provide domestic wireless services nationally in october 2000 most of our and bellsouth’s wireless operations were contributed to cingular which then began operations economic ownership in cingular is held 60 by us and 40 by bellsouth we have equal voting rights and representation on the board of directors that controls cingular because we share control equally we use the equity method of accounting to account for our interest 

cingular faces substantial competition in all aspects of its business as competition continues to increase in the wireless communications industry under current fcc rules six or more pcs licensees two cellular licensees and one or more enhanced specialized mobile radio licensees may operate in each of cingular’s markets on average cingular has four to five other wireless competitors in each of its markets and competes for customers based principally on price service offerings call quality coverage area and customer service 

cingular’s competitors are principally five national verizon wireless att wireless sprint pcs nextel communications and tmobile and a larger number of regional providers of cellular pcs and other wireless communications services cingular also competes with resellers and wireline service providers moreover cingular may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services while some of these technologies and services are now operational others are being developed or may be developed in the future 

additional information on cingular is contained in the 2002 sbc annual report to shareowners under the heading “expected growth areas  wireless” beginning on page 19 and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2 

directory 

our directory segment includes advertising yellow and white pages directories and electronic publishing the directory segment provided approximately 9 of 2002 revenues from all our segments our directory subsidiaries operate primarily in our 13state region 

international 

our international segment includes all of our investments with primarily international operations we have direct or indirect interests in businesses located in more than 25 countries and as of december 31 2002 have international investments with a carrying value of approximately 7 billion including approximately 700 million for our interest in cegetel which we sold in january 2003 for approximately 23 billion and approximately 300 million in marketable equity securities of bce incbce our international investments include local and longdistance telephone services wireless communications voice messaging data services video services internet access telecommunications equipment and directory publishing we report earnings from this segment as equity in net income of affiliates rather than as operating revenue because this segment consists almost exclusively of equity investments rather than direct operations revenues from our international segment are less than 1 of 2002 revenues from all our segments 

we describe below our foreign equity investments and significant transactions relating to these investments financial information about this segment is included in note 6 of the 2002 sbc annual report to shareowners and is incorporated herein by reference pursuant to general instruction g2

recent developments 

fcc triennial review on february 20 2003 the fcc in its triennial review proceeding issued a press release describing general rules it approved concerning the obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers such as our wireline subsidiaries to make available network elements on an unbundled and subsidized basis these rules will replace the fcc’s previous unbundling rules which have been vacated by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia dc court of appeals the fcc did not release a text of its decision prior to the filing of this form 10k and public information about the fcc’s ruling is somewhat limited additional information about the order and its implications for sbc will be known once the text of the decision is released set forth below is a summary of what we now know about the decision 

the triennial review decision rather than establishing a uniform national structure for unbundled network elements unes as mandated by the dc court of appeals in may 2002 largely defers decisions on unes to the states including rules for belowcost unbundled network elementplatform unep the fcc is also revising rules regarding combinations of unbundled loop and dedicated transport elements “impairment” when used below has been defined by the fcc to mean an economic or operational barriers to providing service this term should not be confused with the gaap term “impairment” used in a financial context in certain sections of our annual report 

unep unep is a combination of all of the network elements necessary to provide complete local service to a customer to the extent that any one of those network elements is not required the unep itself cannot be required from a practical perspective the network element most relevant to the unep is “switching” ie the routing of telephone calls or data in its decision the fcc declined to reach any definitive conclusions with regard to the switching element instead leaving to each state to determine the extent if any to which unbundled switching must be provided the fcc did however establish certain presumptions in this regard specifically it presumed that competitors are not “impaired” in their ability to serve larger business customers those using a high capacity loop facility without access to unbundled switching it presumed that competitors are “impaired” in their ability to serve other customers the decision purportedly will set forth specific criteria that each state commission may apply to determine on a “granular” basis whether impairment actually exists in a particular market the state commissions will have three months to overcome the presumption of a lack of impairment for larger business customers they are given nine months to complete the “granular” analysis for other customers if the analysis concludes that impairment does not exist there will be a threeyear transition period off belowcost unep but the fcc did not offer any further details about that transition dedicated transport the fcc redefines dedicated transport to include only those transmission facilities connecting incumbents’ switches or central offices thus eliminating unbundling of entrance facilities connections between the incumbent and competitor networks the fcc concludes that competitive local exchange carriers are considered impaired if they do not have access to dark fiber unused fiber that must be equipped with electronics before it can transmit a communications signal and ds3 and ds1 capacity transport except where alternative wholesale facilities are available state commissions are to perform routespecific “granular” analysis to determine if such alternative wholesale facilities exist for each of these services dark fiber and ds3 transport are also each subject to review by the state commissions to identify whether competing carriers are able to provide their own facilities if state analysis determines that there is no impairment incumbents will not be required to provide belowcost data transport services data transport services also referred to as “special access” services are a component of our wireline revenues enhanced extended links eels incumbent local exchange carriers such as our wireline subsidiaries are currently required to provide combinations of unbundled loop and transport elements ie eels to carriers that are using such combinations to provide a significant amount of local service the triennial review decision apparently revises the test for determining when the “significant local service” test has been met while the details of the new test have not been released we do know that the decision eliminates the existing restriction on “commingling” unes with access services the ability to order new combinations means that competitors in some cases can order unbundled loop and transport combinations without having first ordered them as special access services and then converting them to unes broadband the triennial review decision as described in the fcc’s press release eliminates unbundling of certain telecommunications technology that is primarily used for transmitting data and highspeed internet access across telephone lines for example it eliminates unbundling of the packetswitching capabilities a highly efficient method of transmitting data of incumbents’ local loops and eliminates unbundling of certain fibertothehome ftth loops ftth loops are fiberoptic loops that connect directly from carriers’ networks to customers’ premises traditional telephone lines are copper fiberoptic lines are made of glass and can carry more information over far longer distances than copper under the new fcc rules packetswitching and ftth loops are not considered unes therefore our wireline subsidiaries will not be required to sell them to competitors at belowcost une prices however incumbents must continue to provide unbundled access to copperloop and subloop lines and in areas where unregulated fiberoptic lines are installed in place of copperloop lines incumbents will be required to provide “narrowband service” to be clarified in the decision text unbundled access over the fiberoptic lines additionally incumbents may face constraints on retiring copperloop or subloop lines without prior state regulatory approval although our evaluation of this requirement depends on the scope and implementation standards included in the text of the fcc’s decision continued operation of copper lines that we would otherwise have retired may increase our future expenses and require us to reduce our future capital expenditure budget under the fcc’s line sharing order incumbents such as our wireline subsidiaries were required to share on an unbundled basis the highfrequency portion of the local telephone lines with competitors so that competitors could offer dsl services on a national basis as set forth in the fcc’s press release under the triennial review decision this highfrequency portion of the telephone line is no longer considered a une during a threeyear period competitive carriers will be required to pay an increasing amount for the services and transition existing customers to new arrangements une pricing rules the decision apparently clarifies two components of the fcc unepricing rules that govern the rates incumbents such as our wireline subsidiaries charge competitors for interconnection and leasing portions of the incumbents’ telephone networks first it recommends that the cost of capital used in calculating une prices should reflect the risks associated with a competitive market and second it states that that the use of accelerated depreciation may present a more accurate measure of calculating economic depreciation it appears that much of this portion of the decision consists of suggestions rather than mandates and it is not clear the extent to which the states will adhere to these guidelines therefore the effects of this portion of the decision on our financial position and results of operations are uncertain at this time further notice of proposed rulemaking fnpr the triennial review decision opens a fnpr to seek comment on whether the fcc should modify its “pickandchoose” rule that permits requesting competitive carriers to opt into individual portions of interconnection agreements without accepting all the terms and conditions of the agreements due to the lack of detailed information about the new rules in the fcc’s press release we cannot analyze or quantify the effects of this decision until we review the text of the decision however the new unbundling rules will most likely create an even more uncertain and more complex regulatory environment for our wireline subsidiaries possibly resulting in further reductions in capital expenditures and employment levels as the new rules give each state commission the authority to determine which network elements are to be unbundled and to set unep rules the rules will likely vary by state as well as be subject to implementation and federal appeal on a statebystate basis rather than uniform implementation and review at the federal level furthermore several of the new rules including the fcc’s finding of presumed impairment for switching or unep appear legally suspect the dc court of appeals in vacating the fcc’s une remand order mandated that the fcc apply a meaningful impairment standard when evaluating unes however in the triennial review decision the fcc has provided rules that force incumbents to provide core facilities ie switching and unep to competitors for at least another four years without any finding that competitors would be impaired without such facilities although some relief appears to have been provided by the broadband provisions of the fcc’s triennial review decision the decision may create increased uncertainty and we expect that the decision may have an overall unfavorable effect on our results of operations and financial position we will provide further information as it becomes available in our 2003 forms 10q the triennial review decision is expected to be effective 30 days after official publication and likely will be appealed by various parties

in october 2000 in an effort to promote competition the mexican government passed new telecommunications rules for telmex the rules established interconnection pricing guidelines and also barred telmex from charging less for a service than it charges to other carriers telmex obtained an injunction in mexican court against these rules and hearings remain pending in december 2000 telmex and certain competitors reached an agreement that provided among other things that competitors pay approximately 140 million to telmex for pastdue amounts related to interconnection rates and approximately 550 million for local network costs incurred by telmex in 1997 the agreement also established an interconnection rate of 125 cents per minute for 2001 compared with approximately 334 cents in 2000 in addition as part of the agreement telmex will continue negotiations with competitors regarding a new costbased international settlement model and will review the proportional return mechanism
