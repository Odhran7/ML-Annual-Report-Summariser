distribution and sales 

distribution and sales occur primarily through direct sales offices manufacturers’ representatives resellers and distributors 

governmental regulations 

we face extensive government regulation around the world relating to the development manufacture marketing sale and distribution of our products software and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations to which we are subject but these are not the only regulations to which our businesses must comply for a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to please refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

privacy and data security 

we are subject to privacy and data security laws around the world that may impose operational burdens on our businesses in 2018 the general data protection regulation became effective in the european union and united kingdom and imposed restrictions on how companies use and process personal information in the united states several states have adopted legislation that imposes similar but not identical restrictions on companies conducting business or serving customers in those states for example in january 2020 the california consumer privacy act became effective and required companies to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allowed consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provided a private right of action for data breaches virginia and colorado have passed similar legislation that will become effective in 2023 as will newly enacted changes to california’s privacy laws canada quebec and china have also significantly updated their privacy laws the compliance and other burdens on our businesses imposed by these privacy laws and regulations may be substantial as we work to comply with differing legal and implementation requirements across multiple jurisdictions 

healthcare regulations 

the manufacture sale lease and service of medical diagnostic and surgical devices intended for commercial use are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the fda in the us and by a variety of regulatory agencies in other countries for some of our businesses under the federal food drug and cosmetic act known as the fdc act manufacturers of medical products and devices must comply with certain regulations governing the design testing manufacturing packaging servicing and 

marketing of medical products fda product approvals may be withdrawn or suspended if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing we are also subject to a variety of federal state and foreign laws which broadly relate to our interactions with healthcare practitioners and other participants in the healthcare system including among others antikickback law and laws regulating the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released andor collected such as the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health act or hitech act and the gdpr 

anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and anticorruption laws and similar laws in foreign countries such as the uk antibribery act any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create substantial liability for us subject our officers and directors to personal liability and cause a loss of reputation in the market increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability in addition becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly 

export controls and trade policies 

we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide in particular our sales activities must comply with restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the us export administration regulations us international traffic in arms regulations itar and sanctions administered by the office of foreign asset controls of the us treasury department ofac our businesses may also be impacted by additional domestic or foreign trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices including trade restrictions tariffs and sanctions 

environmental regulations 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and related claims we are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

customers 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net revenues for 2021 for any of our segments or for our company as a whole 

competition 

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the size of the niche market we serve we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

intellectual property 

in addition to trade secrets including unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property like software source code we own or license the rights under numerous patents trademarks trade dress and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with including employees distributors representatives independent contractors and customers to protect our intellectual property we believe none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single item of intellectual property including a trade secret patent trademark trade dress or copyright 

human capital management 

roper is a diversified technology company that utilizes a decentralized operating model across our many businesses which serve a diverse set of end markets subject to oversight and guidance from roper executive management each business operates as an individual unit with its managers empowered to make day to day operating decisions including decisions with respect to human capital management as a result apart from guidance with respect to i compliance with regulatory requirements or corporate policies and ii the implementation of compensation and benefit programs provided by corporate management managers at individual businesses are the primary decision makers with respect to human capital management and development though our individual businesses are primarily responsible for these decisions because of the importance of human capital to our enterprise we provide guidance and share best practices on key aspects of selection development engagement and diversity of talent within our workforce 

as of december 31 2021 we employed approximately 19300 people worldwide on a consolidated basis of which approximately 12300 were employed in the united states and approximately 7000 were outside of the united states approximately 2200 of these employees are employed by zetec which closed in the first quarter of 2022 and transcore which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 management believes that the companys employee relations are favorable 

a very small portion of the company’s us employees are unionized outside the us we have some employees particularly in europe that are represented by an employee representative organization such as a union works council or employee association 

roper has identified and implemented other human capital priorities including providing competitive wages and benefits and promoting a diverse and inclusive work environment the company is committed to increasing diversity and fostering an inclusive work environment that supports our large global workforce and helps us innovate for our customers we continue to focus on building a pipeline for talent to create more opportunities for workplace diversity and to support greater representation within the company 

roper is a founding member of the oneten coalition oneten is an organization that plans to combine the power of over 30 committed large public american companies to upskill hire and promote one million black americans over the next 10 years into familysustaining jobs with opportunities for advancement among the coalition’s founding members roper is uniquely situated to connect black americans with employment opportunities at many of our smaller and growing businesses 

in response to the covid19 pandemic and related mitigation measures we have implemented changes in our business in an effort to protect our employees and customers and to support appropriate health and safety protocols for example we implemented cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office administration spaces and implemented broad workfromhome initiatives while employees in our application software and network software  solutions businesses as well as employees in corporate and administrative functions throughout the company worked remotely throughout much of the pandemic many employees have returned to offices where such can be done in a safe manner employees at our manufacturing and assembly facilities primarily in our measurement  analytical solutions and process solutions businesses have continued to work throughout the pandemic with only minor disruption

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to economic and political conditions 

impacts related to the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 global pandemic on our business including how it has and will impact our customers employees suppliers vendors and business partners the covid19 global pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption which may continue to affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the covid19 global pandemic has caused certain disruptions to our business and operations and could cause material disruptions to our business and operations in the future as a result of among other things quarantines worker absenteeism as a result of illness or other factors social distancing measures and other travel healthrelated business or other restrictions the effects of the pandemic have created and exacerbated challenges with the attraction and retention of talent 

the covid19 global pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact our suppliers and customers as a result of the effects of the covid19 global pandemic our ability to obtain products or services from certain suppliers and to operate at certain locations have been and may continue to be impacted as a result our business financial condition and results of operations have been adversely impacted and could be materially adversely affected if the covid19 global pandemic continues or there are resurgences of covid19 and its variants 

vaccine mandates and testing requirements have been announced in jurisdictions where we operate in addition certain customers have issued vaccine requirements with respect to our employees who provide onsite service at customer facilities our efforts to comply with these mandates including requiring that some or all of our employees be fully vaccinated against covid19 could result in increased labor attrition and disruption as well as difficulty securing future labor needs and could adversely impact our ability to deliver services to our us federal government customers and potentially other customers which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations 

the extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus and its variants including distribution and administration of available vaccines through mandates or otherwise and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change in addition the rapidly changing situation could give rise to additional risks or adverse impacts of which we are not presently aware such as the ability to complete acquisitions the ability to obtain credit through the capital markets andor through our revolving credit facility we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economic and political environment as a whole however the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described below in this “risk factors” section 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

for the year ended december 31 2021 20 of our net revenues and 14 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

• adverse changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions particularly in emerging markets 

• oil price volatility 

• trade protection measures tariffs and import or export requirements 

• subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations 

• partial or total expropriation 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

• differing and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements including any measures implemented to address the impacts of climate change and 

• potentially negative consequences from the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

risks related to our business operations 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2021 we had 79218 in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had approximately 2502 undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds 

• limit our ability to complete future acquisitions 

• limit our ability to pay dividends 

• limit our ability to make capital expenditures 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources and 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 17 and 18 of our total net revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products and services rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues profitability or cash flows 

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business 

divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of preclosing conditions which may not become satisfied the consummation of any divestiture can be difficult timeconsuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified divestitures they may also cause diversion of management time and focus away from operating our business in addition divestitures or other dispositions may have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and disputes may arise with buyers that could be difficult or costly to resolve 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacture and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and cyber insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors in our various businesses our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on material portions of our business 

our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets and any writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2021 goodwill totaled 140945 compared to 115638 of stockholders’ equity and represented 59 of our total assets of 237139 the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating income any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations 

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty cloud platforms such as amazon web services google cloud platform and microsoft azure to host enterprise and customer systems and any disruptions of these services could impact our business operations and our ability to service customers cyberattacks configuration or human error andor other external hazards could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption for example in 2020 vertafore determined that as a result of human error three data files containing texas driver’s license data were inadvertently stored in an unsecured external storage service that appears to have been accessed without authorization as a result vertafore was named as a defendant in a number of putative class actions regarding the incident 

global cybersecurity threats and attacks to networks systems and endpoints can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its businesses its customers andor its thirdparty service providers including but not limited to cloud providers and providers of network management services these may include such things as unauthorized access phishing attacks account takeovers denial of service introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by threat actors moreover as more of our employees work remotely due to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise our employees are increasingly targeted by phishing attacks and endpoints may be more susceptible to threat exposures 

our customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and services and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyberattacks continuous 

monitoring of our networks endpoints and systems and maintenance of backup and recovery capabilities despite these efforts we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect prevent timely and adequately address or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security compromises and such cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage damage to our it systems litigation with third parties theft of intellectual property fines diminution in the value of our investment in research and development and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations any imposition of liability particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers supply chain delays and disruptions changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels for example we expect to continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges including increased material costs component shortages and transportation disruptions and delays all of which could escalate in the future in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to government regulations 

regulation of privacy and data security may adversely affect sales of our products and services and result in increased compliance costs 

there has been and likely will continue to be increased regulation with respect to the collection use and handling of an individual’s personal and financial information regulatory authorities around the world have passed or are considering legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection privacy and data security in the united states virginia and colorado passed new comprehensive privacy legislation and joined california which further enhanced its existing privacy laws in directly regulating the collection use and sharing of personal information these statutes create civil penalties for violations and in the case of california creates a private right of action for data breaches that increases the risk of data breach litigation absent a preemptive federal privacy law as more states pass privacy legislation there is a strong possibility that we will be forced to comply with a patchwork of inconsistent privacy regulations globally personal information collected within the european union and united kingdom remains subject to the 2018 general data protection regulation gdpr which is a uk and european unionwide legal framework that governs data collection use and sharing of an individual’s personal data and creates a range of consumer privacy rights gdpr provides significant penalties for noncompliance up to 4 of global revenue and eu data protection authorities have already issued significant fines similarly in november 2021 china promulgated the personal information protection law pipl which regulates the processing of personal information of individuals within china if a company breaches pipl it can be assessed fines of up 5 of its annual revenue the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws and industry standards in the united states europe china and elsewhere can be uncertain and currently is in flux cloudbased solutions may be subject to further regulation including data localization requirements and other restrictions concerning international transfer of data the operational and cost impact of these cannot be fully known at this time in addition to the possibility of fines application of these existing laws in a manner inconsistent with our data and privacy practices could result in an order requiring that we change our data and privacy practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business also any new law or regulation imposing greater fees or taxes or restriction on the collection use or transfer of information or data internationally or over the internet could result in a decline in the use of our products and services and adversely affect sales and our results of operations finally as we increasingly become a provider of technology solutions our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and security regulations as well as our privacy policies and data handling practices and our inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers this is particularly true for customers in highlyregulated industries such as the healthcare industry and government contractors and could result in regulatory actions fines legal proceedings and negatively impact our brand reputation and our business 

general risk factors 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism incidents of directed cyberattacks public health crisis extreme weather events or other natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict directed cyberattacks political instability public health crisis such as an epidemic or pandemic related to the covid19 or extreme weather events or other natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress in addition the global covid19 pandemic has created heightened risk that third parties may be unable to perform their obligations or suffer financial distress due to the global economic impact of the pandemic and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments to contain the spread of the virus however we are unable predict the impact that covid19 will have on any of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions or their ability to perform their obligations if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team and the resulting management transitions could harm our operating results 

we have experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team in the past and may do so in the future leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions if we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims we are and may in the future become subject to litigation regarding data or privacy incidents as more fully described above in “ we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations” 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets may be impacted and the price we pay to issue debt could increase additionally our credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing

all currency amounts are in millions unless specified 

overview 

we are a diversified technology company we operate businesses that design and develop software both license and saas and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses that offer high valueadded software services engineered products and solutions that we believe are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins we compete in many niche markets and believe we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in most of these markets 

discontinued operations 

during 2021 roper signed definitive agreements to divest its transcore zetec and civco radiotherapy businesses roper has completed the divestitures of zetec and civco radiotherapy in the first quarter of 2022 and fourth quarter of 2021 respectively and expects the transcore transaction to close in the first quarter of 2022 subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals the financial results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented information regarding discontinued operations is included in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of revenue recognition income taxes valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill and indefinitelived impairment analyses estimates are considered to be significant if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to have a material financial impact from periodtoperiod 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible or if the 

tax law changes are unfavorable then we could be required to recognize valuation allowances against deferred tax balances resulting in an increase to income tax expense and the effective tax rate 

during 2021 our effective income tax rate was 227 as compared to the 2020 rate of 215 the increase was due primarily to a nonrecurring item related to a uk tax rate change which had a 217 unfavorable impact in 2021 we expect the effective tax rate for 2022 to be approximately 21 to 22 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required under the qualitative assessment we consider various qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions relevant industry and market trends cost factors overall financial performance other entityspecific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit 

we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the quantitative assessment utilizes an equal weighted income approach discounted cash flows and market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value a noncash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess 

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the projected revenue growth rates future operating margins discount rates terminal values and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances 

recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units 

roper has 34 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to 32453 in 2021 the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units the company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount the company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in any of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units as of october 1 2021 

trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived trade name is less than its carrying amount if necessary we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a thirdparty would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the royalty rates projected revenue growth rates discount rates and terminal values each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of 

impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company determined the use of the sunquest trade name would be discontinued given the strategic action to merge the sunquest business into our clinisys business both of which are reported in our application software reportable segment considering the planned merger and updated market comparisons the royalty rate utilized in the quantitative impairment assessment of the trade name was 05 as compared to a royalty rate of 35 used in the prior year the royalty rate reduction was the significant assumption that resulted in a noncash impairment charge of 944 recognized as a component of “impairment of intangible assets” within the consolidated statements of earnings 

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses andor reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 

the most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships the fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future aftertax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the customer attrition rates projected customer revenue growth rates margins contributory asset charges and discount rates when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical customer attrition patterns 

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 sunquest also recognized a noncash impairment charge of 51 representing the unamortized balance related primarily to a software intangible asset that will be discontinued in 2022 this impairment charge is included as a component of “impairment of intangible assets” within the consolidated statements of earnings

gain on disposal of businesses resulted in a pretax gain of 9207 for the year ended december 31 2019 the company recognized 1196 on the sale of the imaging businesses which closed february 5 2019 and 8011 on the sale of gatan which closed october 29 2019 

during 2020 our effective income tax rate was 215 as compared to our 2019 rate of 203 the increase was due primarily to the following nonrecurring items in 2019 i recognition of a discrete tax benefit of 410 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and ii the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the excess of gatans book basis over tax basis in the shares of 100 in the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains during 2019 

order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements backlog increased 403 to 20618 at december 31 2020 as compared to 14697 at december 31 2019 acquisitions contributed approximately 33 and organic growth was 7 



financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

all currency amounts are in millions unless specified 

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 are as follows a detailed discussion of fiscal 2020 yearoveryear changes can be found in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 



operating activities  the growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher net income net of noncash expenses and the nonrecurrence of 2019 of cash taxes paid on the disposal of gatan in 2020 these increases were partially offset by lower cash provided by working capital as compared to the prior year 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities during 2021 was primarily for business acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from the sale of civco radiotherapy cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily for business acquisitions most notably vertafore and epsi 

financing activities  cash used in financing activities during 2021 was primarily due to net repayments of 11500 on our unsecured credit facility 5000 of repayments for our senior notes and dividend payments cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was primarily from the issuance of 33000 of senior notes and 16200 of net borrowings on the revolver partially offset by 6000 of repayments for senior notes and to a lesser extent dividend payments 

net working capital total current assets excluding cash and current assets held for sale less total current liabilities excluding debt and current liabilities held for sale was negative 8825 at december 31 2021 compared to negative 7044 at december 31 2020 due primarily to increased balances of deferred revenue and income taxes payable partially offset by increased accounts receivable consistent negative net working capital demonstrates roper’s focus on assetlight business models 

total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was 79703 at december 31 2021 408 of total capital compared to 96205 at december 31 2020 479 of total capital our total debt decreased at december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 due primarily to 11500 of revolving debt repayments and the redemption of 5000 of outstanding 280 senior unsecured notes 

on september 2 2020 the company entered into a threeyear unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent wells fargo bank na and bank of america na as syndication agents and mufg bank ltd mizuho bank ltd pnc bank national association truist bank and td bank na as codocumentation agents which replaced its previous 25000 unsecured credit facility dated as of september 23 2016 as amended the facility comprises a threeyear 30000 revolving credit facility which includes availability of up to 1500 for letters of credit the company may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 5000 

the credit agreement requires the company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio as defined in the credit agreement of 065 to 100 or less borrowings under the credit agreement are prepayable at roper’s option at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

at december 31 2021 we had 75000 of senior unsecured notes and 4700 of outstanding revolver borrowings we had 849 of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2021 of which 282 was covered by our lending group thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately 

we may redeem some or all of our senior unsecured notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities 

see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes 

cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2021 totaled 3108 as compared to 2591 at december 31 2020 an increase of 200 the increase was due primarily due to cash generated from foreign operations partially offset by the repatriation of 3293 during the year we intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings 

capital expenditures of 329 283 and 430 were incurred during 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively capitalized software expenditures of 297 177 and 102 were incurred during 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2021 as compared to 2020 and 2019 in the future we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 10 and 15 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

all currency amounts are in millions 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2021 



1 we have excluded the liability for uncertain tax positions and certain other tax liabilities as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

2 represents minimum fixed price purchase commitments that are legally binding across roper 



as of december 31 2021 we had 6597 of outstanding surety bonds of which 6342 are directly associated with our transcore business  certain contracts primarily those involving public sector customers require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations 

  

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our business financial condition and results of operations such acquisitions may be financed by the use of existing credit lines future cash flows from operations future divestitures the proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity securities or any combination of these methods the terms and availability of which will be subject to market and economic conditions generally 

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2022 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions the financial performance of our existing companies and the financial markets generally none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

recently issued accounting standards 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2021 we had 75000 of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 045 to 420 at december 31 2021 the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 26 lower and 07 higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments our credit facility contains a 30000 variablerate revolver with 4700 of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2021 

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 17 of our total revenues in 2021 and 77 of these revenues were recognized by companies with a european functional currency if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2021 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1 

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

privacy and data security 

we are subject to the privacy and data security laws of the united states and internationally a number of states in the united states have passed or introduced bills which if passed impose operational requirements on us companies similar to the requirements reflected in the general data protection regulation “gdpr” in the european union eu for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which came into effect on january 1 2020 requires covered companies that process personal information on california residents to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new private right of action for data breaches the compliance and other burdens imposed by the eus gdpr ccpa and similar privacy laws and regulations may be substantial to our businesses as they are subject to differing interpretations and implementation among jurisdictions 

healthcare regulations 

the manufacture sale lease and service of medical diagnostic and surgical devices intended for commercial use are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the fda in the us and by a variety of regulatory agencies in other countries for some of our businesses under the federal food drug and cosmetic act known as the fdc act manufacturers of medical products and devices must comply with certain regulations governing the design testing manufacturing packaging servicing and marketing of medical products fda product approvals may be withdrawn or suspended if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing we are also subject to a variety of federal state and foreign laws which broadly relate to our interactions with healthcare practitioners and other participants in the healthcare system including among others antikickback law and laws regulating the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released andor collected such as the health insurance portability 

and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa the health information technology for economic and clinical health act or hitech act and the gdpr 

anticorruption and antibribery laws and regulations 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and anticorruption laws and similar laws in foreign countries such as the uk antibribery act any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create substantial liability for us subject our officers and directors to personal liability and cause a loss of reputation in the market increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability in addition becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly 

export controls and trade policies 

we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide in particular our sales activities must comply with restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the us export administration regulations us international traffic in arms regulations itar and sanctions administered by the office of foreign asset controls of the us treasury department ofac our businesses may also be impacted by additional domestic or foreign trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices including trade restrictions tariffs and sanctions

customers 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net revenues for 2020 for any of our segments or for our company as a whole 

competition 

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the size of the niche market we serve we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

intellectual property 

in addition to trade secrets including unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property like software source code we own or license the rights under numerous patents trademarks trade dress and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with including employees distributors representatives independent contractors and customers to protect our intellectual property we believe none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single item of intellectual property including a trade secret patent trademark trade dress or copyright 

human capital management 

roper is a diversified technology company that utilizes a decentralized operating model across our many businesses which serve a diverse set of end markets subject to oversight and guidance from roper executive management each business operates as an individual unit with its managers empowered to make day to day operating decisions including decisions with respect to human capital management as a result apart from guidance with respect to i compliance with regulatory requirements or corporate policies and ii the implementation of compensation and benefit programs provided by corporate 

management managers at individual businesses are the primary decision makers with respect to human capital management and development though our individual businesses are primarily responsible for these decisions because of the importance of the subject to our enterprise we provide guidance and share best practices on key aspects of selection development engagement and diversity of talent within our workforce 

as of december 31 2020 we employed approximately 18400 people worldwide on a consolidated basis of which approximately 12200 were employed in the united states and approximately 6200 were outside of the united states management believes that the companys employee relations are favorable 

a very small portion of the company’s us employees are unionized outside the us we have some employees particularly in europe that are represented by an employee representative organization such as a union works council or employee association 

roper has identified and implemented other human capital priorities including providing competitive wages and benefits and promoting a diverse and inclusive work environment the company is committed to increasing diversity and fostering an inclusive work environment that supports our large global workforce and helps us innovate for our customers we continue to focus on building a pipeline for talent to create more opportunities for workplace diversity and to support greater representation within the company

in response to the covid19 pandemic and related mitigation measures in march 2020 we implemented changes in our business in an effort to protect our employees and customers and to support appropriate health and safety protocols for example we implemented cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office administration spaces and implemented broad workfromhome initiatives additionally employees in our application software and network software  solutions businesses as well as employees in corporate and administrative functions throughout the company have effectively worked remotely since midmarch 2020 though some employees are gradually returning to offices where such can be done in a safe manner employees at our manufacturing and assembly facilities primarily in our measurement  analytical solutions and process solutions businesses have continued to work throughout the pandemic with only minor disruption

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to economic and political conditions 

the extent to which the coronavirus covid19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict 

the novel strain of the coronavirus identified in late 2019 has spread across the globe and has resulted in governmental and other regulatory authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus and its variants such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations as well as the work force operations and financial prospects of our customers suppliers and business partners there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures such as restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce or similar limitations for our customers suppliers and business partners the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel developing social distancing plans for our employees expanding the number of our associates who work from 

home and cancelling physical participation in meetings events and tradeshows and we may take further actions as may be required by governmental and other regulatory authorities or as we determine are necessary to protect the safety or best interests of our employees customers suppliers and business partners 

impacts our businesses are experiencing from covid19 include but are not limited to 

• the ability of our businesses to visit current and potential customers in order to solicit new business andor provide necessary onsite installation implementation and training services has been impacted by the pandemic which has in some cases limited our ability to obtain new business and effectively service existing business 

• government restrictions on nonemergency hospital procedures resulted in decreased 1 demand in our businesses that provide medical products used in nonemergency procedures and 2 revenue related to pharmaceutical utilization in postacute healthcare settings 

• the unprecedented slowdown andor shut down of global economy sectors and the related uncertain timeline to reopen and recover particularly in areas experiencing a more severe outbreak of the virus has created a weak demand environment for our businesses serving industrial and energy markets and 

• some of our customers including those in the medical field may seek to delay payments to us while they are addressing the numerous challenges presented by covid19 to date such delays have not impacted the timing of our cash flow in a significant manner 

the extent to which the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus including distribution and administration of available vaccines and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume after the covid19 outbreak subsides we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’s global economic impact including the availability of credit adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of covid19 and its variants as a global pandemic may have on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and as a result the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change in addition the rapidly changing situation could give rise to additional risks or adverse impacts of which we are not presently aware such as the ability to complete acquisitions the ability to obtain credit through the capital markets andor through our revolving credit facility we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the global economic and political environment as a whole however the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described below in this “risk factors” section 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

for the year ended december 31 2020 19 of our net revenues and 15 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

• adverse changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions particularly in emerging markets 

• oil price volatility 

• trade protection measures tariffs and import or export requirements 

• subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that are currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations 

• partial or total expropriation 

• potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor regulations 

• differing protection of intellectual property 

• differing and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and 

• potentially negative consequences from the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

risks related to our business operations 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2020 we had 95665 in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 13510 undrawn availability under our senior unsecured credit facility subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds 

• limit our ability to complete future acquisitions 

• limit our ability to pay dividends 

• limit our ability to make capital expenditures 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources and 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 16 of our total net revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products and services rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired 

businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues profitability or cash flows 

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacture and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors in our various businesses our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on material portions of our business 

our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets and any writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2020 goodwill totaled 143952 compared to 104798 of stockholders’ equity and represented 60 of our total assets of 240248 the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating income any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations 

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis computer viruses cyberattacks other external hazards andor human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption for example vertafore determined that as a result of human error three data files containing texas driver’s license data were inadvertently stored in an unsecured external storage service that appears to have been accessed without authorization as a result vertafore has been named as a defendant in a number of putative class actions regarding the incident 

global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to it systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company its businesses its customers andor its thirdparty service providers including but not limited to cloud providers and providers of network management services these may include such things as unauthorized access phishing attacks account takeovers denial of service computer viruses introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers including incidents similar to the “trojan horse” attack commonly referred to as the solarwinds security breach moreover as more of our employees work remotely due to the covid 19 pandemic or otherwise our networks and systems may be more susceptible to breach or sabotage due to employee misuse or error which may increase the risk of access to our systems by unauthorized parties 

our customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and services and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy measures to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threats including identity and access controls data protection vulnerability assessments product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyberattacks continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems despite these efforts we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect prevent timely and adequately address or mitigate the negative effects of cyberattacks or other security compromises and such cybersecurity incidents depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our own or that of third parties and the disruption of business operations the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage damage to our it systems litigation with third parties theft of intellectual property fines diminution in the value of our investment in research and development and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations any imposition of liability particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to government regulations 

regulation of privacy and data security may adversely affect sales of our products and services and result in increased compliance costs 

there has been and we believe that there will continue to be increased regulation with respect to the collection use and handling of personal financial and other information as regulatory authorities in the united states and around the world have recently passed or are currently considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection privacy and data security this includes the california consumer privacy act or ccpa which came into effect in january 2020 and the gdpr which is a european unionwide legal framework to govern data collection use and sharing and related consumer privacy rights that became effective in may 2018 the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation the gdpr provides significant penalties for noncompliance up to 4 of global revenue european data protection authorities have already imposed fines for gdpr violations up to in some cases hundreds of millions of euros many states in the united states are also considering their own privacy laws that in the absence of a preemptive federal privacy law could impose burdensome and conflicting requirements the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws and industry standards in the united states europe and elsewhere can be uncertain and currently is in flux cloudbased solutions may be subject to further regulation including data localization requirements and other restrictions concerning international transfer of data the operational and cost impact of which cannot be fully known at this time in addition to the possibility of fines application of these existing laws in a manner inconsistent with our data and privacy practices could result in an order requiring that we change our data and privacy practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business also any new law or regulation or interpretation of existing law or regulation imposing greater fees or taxes or restriction on the collection use or transfer of information or data internationally or over the web could result in a decline in the use and adversely affect sales of our products and services and our results of operations finally as we increasingly become a provider of technology solutions our customers and regulators will expect that we can demonstrate compliance with current data privacy and security regulations as well as our privacy policies and the information we make available to our customers and the public about our data handling practices and our inability to do so may adversely impact sales of our solutions and services to certain customers particularly customers in highlyregulated industries such as the healthcare industry and could result in regulatory actions fines legal proceedings and negatively impact our brand reputation and our business 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net revenues these sales accounted for 7 and 10 of our net revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

• unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with us and other jurisdictions’ export requirements 

• restrictions on the export of technology and related products 

• unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with us and other jurisdictions’ export policies to certain countries 

• unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets and 

• a general economic downturn in our foreign markets 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings 

general risk factors 

changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team and the resulting management transitions could harm our operating results 

over the past several years we have experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions if we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism incidents of directed cyber attacks public health crisis or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict directed cyber attacks political instability public health crisis such as an epidemic or pandemic related to the covid19 or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services or who purchase goods and services from us will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress notably the global covid19 pandemic has created heightened risk that third parties may be unable to perform their obligations or suffer financial distress due to the global economic impact of the pandemic and the regulatory measures that have been enacted by governments to contain the spread of the virus however we are unable predict the impact that covid19 will have on any of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions or their ability to perform their obligations if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us in such events we may incur losses or our results of operations financial condition or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 

legal proceedings in which we are or may be a party may adversely affect us 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers or customers intellectual property matters third party liability including product liability claims and employment claims we are and may in the future become subject to litigation regarding data or privacy incidents as more fully described above in “ we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations” 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets may be impacted and the price we pay to issue debt could increase additionally our credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded further an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing

overview 

we are a diversified technology company we operate businesses that design and develop software both license and saas and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both new strategic platforms and additions to existing businesses 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2020 included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition income taxes valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill and indefinitelived impairment analyses estimates are considered to be significant if they meet both of the following criteria 1 the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and 2 changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from periodtoperiod 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given after the customer obtains control over the promised products or services including in certain cases credits for returned products allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances changes to customer creditworthiness and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions based on an analysis of historical credit memos and is treated as a reduction in revenue at december 31 2020 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 253 and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 38 for a total of 291 or 33 of total gross accounts receivable as compared to a total of 203 or 25 of total gross accounts receivable at december 31 2019 this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use 

historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2020 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 404 or 169 of gross inventory cost as compared to 334 or 144 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2019 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost is influenced by specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory 

most of our productbased revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 to 24 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

revenues from our projectbased businesses including toll and traffic systems control systems and installations of large software application projects are generally recognized over time using the input method primarily utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs as the measure of performance the company recognized revenues of 3450 2478 and 2459 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively using this method there was 3639 and 4016 of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease was due primarily to revenue recognized at our transcore business related to the contract for the new york central business district tolling program during 2020 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2020 our effective income tax rate was 215 as compared to the 2019 rate of 206 the increase was due primarily to the following nonrecurring items in 2019 i recognition of a discrete tax benefit of 410 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and ii the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the excess of gatans book basis over tax basis in the shares of 100 in the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains during 2019 we expect the effective tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 21 to 22 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required under the qualitative assessment we consider various qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions relevant industry and market trends cost factors overall financial performance other entityspecific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit 

we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value a noncash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess 

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the projected revenue growth rates future operating margins discount rates terminal values and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances 

recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units 

roper has 36 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to 32287 in 2020 the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units the company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount the company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 35 of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units for the remaining reporting unit the company performed its quantitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of october 1 2020 

trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived trade name is less than its carrying amount if necessary we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a thirdparty would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the royalty rates projected revenue growth rates discount rates and terminal values each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth 

the company performed a quantitative analysis over the fair values of two of its trade names and concluded that the fair value exceeded its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of october 1 2020 of those trade names subjected to our quantitative analysis one associated with our lab software business had a fair value approximately 20 in excess of its carrying value as compared to 2019 when the fair value approximated its carrying value the primary driver of the increase in the fair value from 2019 to 2020 was a decrease in the discount rate primarily due to a reduced riskfree interest rate a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a 28 impairment and a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in a fair value that approximates its carrying value 

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses andor reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2020 

the most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships the fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future aftertax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the customer attrition rates projected customer revenue growth rates margins contributory asset charges and discount rates when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical customer attrition patterns 

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

  

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 were 55271 as compared to 53668 for the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 30 the increase was the result of net acquisitiondivestiture contribution of 39 and a foreign exchange benefit of 01 partially offset by an organic decline of 10 

in our application software segment net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 increased by 2119 or 13 over the year ended december 31 2019 organic revenues increased by 1 and acquisitions accounted for 13 of our growth the growth in organic revenues was primarily due to businesses serving healthcare and government contracting markets gross margin increased to 683 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 670 for the year ended december 31 2019 due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues and revenue mix selling general and administrative “sga” expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december 31 2020 increased to 422 as compared to 415 in the year ended december 31 2019 due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2020 the resulting operating margin was 260 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 255 in the year ended december 31 2019 

our network software  systems segment reported a 2091 or 14 increase in net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 over the year ended december 31 2019 organic revenues increased by 4 and acquisitions accounted for 10 of our growth the growth in organic revenues was led by our higher project activity at our toll and traffic business and subscription growth at our saas businesses gross margin decreased to 671 for the year ended december 31 2020 from 692 for the year ended december 31 2019 due primarily to revenue mix sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 355 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 340 in the year ended december 31 2019 due primarily to higher amortization of acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2019 the resulting operating margin was 316 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 352 in the year ended december 31 2019 

net revenues for our measurement  analytical solutions segment decreased by 1265 or 8 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 organic revenues increased 1 more than offset by a decrease in revenue of 9 attributable to the disposal of gatan and the imaging businesses the growth in organic revenues was due to accelerated adoption of verathon’s videoassisted intubation products that aid in reducing covid transmission to healthcare workers partially offset by declines in our water meter technology business due to restricted access to indoor meters located in the northeast united states and canada and industrial business declines gross margin increased to 592 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 585 in the year ended december 31 2019 due primarily to revenue mix sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively flat at 270 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 271 in the year ended december 31 2019 the resulting operating margin was 322 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 314 in the year ended december 31 2019 

in our process technologies segment net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 1342 or 21 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 all of which was organic the decrease in organic revenues was due to broadbased revenue declines across the segment led by lower demand at our businesses serving upstream oil and gas end markets resulting from lower energy prices and the covid19 pandemic gross margin decreased to 535 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 569 in the year ended december 31 2019 due primarily to lower revenues sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 281 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 223 in the year ended december 31 2019 due primarily to 136 of restructuring charges for structural cost reduction actions taken at certain of our businesses and lower operating leverage on organic revenue declines as a result operating margin was 254 in the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 346 in the year ended december 31 2019 

corporate expenses increased by 201 to 1925 or 35 of revenues in 2020 as compared to 1724 or 32 of revenues in 2019 the dollar increase was due primarily to higher stock compensation expense and professional services 

interest expense net increased 323 or 173 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the increase was due to i higher weighted average debt balances partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates and ii 72 in interest expense for the origination fee on our bridge financing associated with the vertafore acquisition 

other expense net of 29 and 51 for the year ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our nonus based subsidiaries partially offset by royalty income 

gain on disposal of businesses resulted in a pretax gain of 9207 for the year ended december 31 2019 the company recognized 1196 on the sale of the imaging businesses which closed february 5 2019 and 8011 on the sale of gatan which closed october 29 2019 

during 2020 our effective income tax rate was 215 as compared to our 2019 rate of 206 the increase was due primarily to the following nonrecurring items in 2019 i recognition of a discrete tax benefit of 410 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and ii the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the excess of gatans book basis over tax basis in the shares of 100 in the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains during 2019 

order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements backlog increased 27 to 25161 at december 31 2020 as compared to 19854 at december 31 2019 organic growth was 3 and acquisitions contributed 24 



  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

all currency amounts are in millions unless specified 

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 are as follows 



operating activities  the growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 and in 2019 was primarily due to improvement in working capital lower cash taxes paid excluding the tax associated with gain on disposal of businesses and 437 of employer social security payroll taxes deferred during the year ended december 31 2020 that are payable in installments in 2021 and 2022 under the us coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares” act partially offset by higher cash taxes paid of 2019 on the disposal of gatan paid in 2020 as compared to 394 of cash taxes paid on the disposal of the imaging businesses in 2019 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily for business acquisitions most notably vertafore and epsi cash used in investing activities during 2019 was primarily for business acquisitions most notably ipipeline and foundry partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of the gatan business and the imaging businesses 

financing activities  cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was primarily from the issuance of 33000 of senior notes and 16200 of net borrowings on the revolver partially offset by 6000 of repayments for senior notes and to a lesser extent dividend payments cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily from the issuance of 12000 of senior notes partially offset by 8650 of revolving debt repayments and to a lesser extent dividend payments 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was negative 4984 at december 31 2020 compared to negative 5054 at december 31 2019 due primarily to lower income taxes payable and increased accounts receivable partially offset by increased deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities the decrease in income taxes payable is due primarily to the 2019 income tax cash payment associated with the divestiture of gatan the deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscriptionbased services consistent negative net working capital demonstrates roper’s continued evolution and focus on assetlight business models 

total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was 96262 at december 31 2020 479 of total capital compared to 53077 at december 31 2019 359 of total capital our increased total debt at december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 was due primarily to the issuance of 33000 senior unsecured notes and 16200 of revolving debt borrowings partially offset by the redemption of 6000 of outstanding 300 senior unsecured notes the net proceeds were used primarily to fund the purchase price of the acquisition of vertafore 

on september 2 2020 the company entered into a new threeyear unsecured credit facility among roper the financial institutions from time to time party thereto jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent wells fargo bank na and bank of america na as syndication agents and mufg bank ltd mizuho bank ltd pnc bank national association truist bank and td bank na as codocumentation agents which replaced its existing 25000 unsecured credit facility dated as of september 23 2016 as amended the new facility comprises a threeyear 30000 revolving credit facility which includes availability of up to 1500 for letters of credit loans under the facility will be available in dollars and letters of credit will be available in dollars and other currencies to be agreed the company may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 5000 

the credit agreement requires the company to maintain a total debt to total capital ratio as defined in the credit agreement of 065 to 100 or less borrowings under the credit agreement are prepayable at roper’s option at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

at december 31 2020 we had 80000 of senior unsecured notes and 16200 of outstanding revolver borrowings in addition we had 62 of other debt in the form of finance leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our nonus businesses we had 671 of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2020 of which 290 was covered by our lending group thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately 

we may redeem some or all of our senior unsecured notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities 

see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes 

cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2020 totaled 2591 as compared to 2918 at december 31 2019 a decrease of 112 the decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of 3734 during the year partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations we intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings 

capital expenditures of 312 527 and 491 were incurred during 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively capitalized software expenditures of 177 102 and 95 were incurred during 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2020 as compared to 2019 and 2018 in the future we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 10 and 15 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

all currency amounts are in millions 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2020 





1 we have excluded the liability for uncertain tax positions and certain other tax liabilities as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

as of december 31 2020 we had 7169 of outstanding surety bonds certain contracts primarily those involving public sector customers require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations 

  

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements although we maintain an active acquisition program we are committed to reducing debt future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our business financial condition and results of operations such acquisitions may be financed by the use of existing credit lines future cash flows from operations future divestitures the proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity securities or any combination of these methods the terms and availability of which will be subject to market and economic conditions generally 

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2021 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions the financial performance of our existing companies and the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business prospects and the financial markets generally none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

at december 31 2020 and 2019 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recently issued accounting standards 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2020 we had 80000 of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 045 to 420 at december 31 2020 the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 32 lower and 01 higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments our credit facility contains a 30000 variablerate revolver with 16200 of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2020 

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 16 of our total revenues in 2020 and 74 of these revenues were recognized by companies with a european functional currency if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2020 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1 

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

risk factors 

tableend 

risks relating to our business 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2019  we had 53 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 25 billion undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

additionally on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority fca in the uk announced that it would phase out london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop if libor ceases to exist we may need to amend certain agreements and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected in addition the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 16 and 17 of our total net revenues for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net revenues these sales accounted for 10 and 11 of our net revenues for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 



the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2019  19 of our net revenues and 17 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability 

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacture and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive 

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations 

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis computer viruses cyberattacks other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions 

a breach in the security of our software could harm our reputation result in a loss of current and potential customers and subject us to material claims which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our security measures are breached an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data in addition cyberattacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of customers’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countries 

regulatory authorities around the world have adopted and are considering further adoption of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and data privacy in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

any security breaches for which we are or are perceived to be responsible in whole or in part could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations which could harm our reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts any imposition of liability particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could materially harm our operating results and financial condition security breaches also could cause us to lose current and potential customers which could have an adverse effect on our business moreover we might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could in certain instances require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases additionally we could be affected by future regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in some of our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on material portions of our business 

our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets and any writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2019  goodwill totaled 108 billion compared to 95 billion of stockholders’ equity and represented 60 of our total assets of 181 billion  the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating income any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism public health crisis or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability public health crisis such as an epidemic or pandemic related to the coronavirus or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

recent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team and the resulting management transitions could harm our operating results 

over the past several years we have experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions if we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report as well as part ii “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 which provides additional information on comparisons of years 2018 and 2017 relating to any sections which remain unchanged 

  

overview 

we are a diversified technology company we operate businesses that design and develop software both license and saas and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both new strategic platforms and additions to existing businesses 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019 included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition income taxes valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill and indefinitelived impairment analyses these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2019  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 169 and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 34 for a total of 203  or 25 of total gross accounts receivable as compared to a total of 231  or 32 of total gross accounts receivable at december 31 2018  this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2019  inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 334  or 144 of gross inventory cost as compared to 303  or 137 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2018  the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory 

most of our productbased revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 to 24 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  

revenues from our projectbased businesses including toll and traffic systems control systems and installations of large software application projects are generally recognized over time using the input method primarily utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs as the measure of performance the company recognized revenues of 2478  2459 and 2493 for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively using this method there was 4016 and 2416 of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized at december 31 2019  and 2018 respectively the primary driver in the increase was due to our transcore business that was awarded the contract for the new york central business district tolling program 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2019  our effective income tax rate was 206  as compared to the 2018 rate of 212  the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of 410 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and the reversal of the deferred tax liability of 100 originally recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with the excess of gatans book basis over our tax basis in the shares during the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains we expect the effective tax rate for 2020 to be between 21 and 23 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required under the qualitative assessment we consider various qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions relevant industry and market trends cost factors overall financial performance other entityspecific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit 

we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value a noncash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess 

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances 

recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units 

roper has 35 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to 25 billion  in 2019  the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units the company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount the company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 33 of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units for the remaining two reporting units the company performed its quantitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of each of these two reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of october 1 2019  

trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived trade name is less than its carrying amount if necessary we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a thirdparty would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using a riskadjusted rate of capital each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth 

the company performed a quantitative analysis over the fair values of two of its trade names and concluded that the fair value exceeded its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of october 1 2019  of those trade names subjected to our quantitative analysis one associated with our lab software business had a fair value that approximated its carrying value which was 1004 as of october 1 2019 holding other assumptions constant for the specific trade name associated with our lab software business a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a 55 impairment and a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an 97 impairment 

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses andor reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2019  

the most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships the fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future aftertax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical customer attrition patterns 

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

during 2019  our effective income tax rate was 206 as compared to our 2018 rate of 212  the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of 410 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and the reversal of the deferred tax liability of 100 originally recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with the excess of gatans book basis over our tax basis in the shares during the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

all currency amounts are in millions unless specified 

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 are as follows 



operating activities  the growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 and in 2018 was primarily due to increased earnings net of noncash expenses partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2019 most notably cash taxes paid on the gain on sale of the imaging businesses 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities during 2019 was primarily for business acquisitions most notably ipipeline and foundry partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of the gatan business and the imaging businesses cash used in investing activities during 2018 was primarily for business acquisitions most notably powerplan 

financing activities  cash provided byused in financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repaymentsborrowings as well as dividends paid to stockholders cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily from the issuance of 12 billion of senior notes partially offset by 8650 of revolving debt repayments and to a lesser extent dividend payments cash used in financing activities during 2018 was primarily from the paydown of revolving debt borrowings of 4050 partially offset by the net issuance of senior notes of 2000 and dividends paid to shareholders 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was negative 5054 at december 31 2019 compared to negative 2004 at december 31 2018  due primarily to increased income taxes payable deferred revenue and the adoption of asc 842 partially offset by increased accounts receivable the increase in income taxes payable is due primarily to the approximately 2000 of taxes incurred on the gain associated with the divestiture of gatan we expect to pay these taxes in the second quarter of 2020 the deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscriptionbased services 

total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was 53 billion at december 31 2019  359 of total capital compared to 50 billion at december 31 2018  391 of total capital our increased total debt at december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 was due primarily to the issuance of 5000 of 235 senior unsecured notes and 7000 of 295 senior unsecured notes partially offset by the paydown of revolving debt borrowings of 8650 

on september 23 2016 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured credit facility as amended as of december 2 2016 the “2016 facility” with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility dated as of july 27 2012 as amended as of october 28 2015 the “2012 facility” the 2016 facility comprises a five year 25 billion revolving credit facility which includes availability of up to 1500 for letters of credit we may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 5000  

the 2016 facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt enter into certain mergers and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 35 to 1 

the 2016 facility provides that the consolidated total leverage ratio may be increased no more than twice during the term of the 2016 facility to 400 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase or for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 425 to 1 in conjunction with the deltek acquisition in december of 2016 we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 425 to 1 through june 30 2017 and 400 to 1 through december 31 2017 

at december 31 2019  we had 53 billion of senior unsecured notes and 00 of outstanding revolver borrowings in addition we had 77 of other debt in the form of finance leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our nonus businesses we had 740 of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2019  of which 358 was covered by our lending group thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately 

we may redeem some or all of our senior secured notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  

see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes 

cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2019 totaled 2918 as compared to 3390 at december 31 2018  a decrease of 139  the decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of 2906 during the year and cash used in the acquisition of foundry partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations we intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax 

capital expenditures of 527  491 and 488 were incurred during 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively capitalized software expenditures of 102  95 and 108 were incurred during 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2019 as compared to 2018 and 2017 in the future we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 10 and 15 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

all currency amounts are in millions 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2019  





1 we have excluded the liability for uncertain tax positions and certain other tax liabilities as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

as of december 31 2019  we had 7327 of outstanding surety bonds certain contracts primarily those involving public sector customers require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations 

  

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2020 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

at december 31 2019 and 2018  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2019  we had 53 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 235 to 420 at december 31 2019  the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 01 and 15 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments our credit facility contains a 25 billion variablerate revolver with 0 of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2019  

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 16 of our total revenues in 2019 and 70 of these revenues were recognized by companies with a european functional currency if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2019 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1 

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

we believe most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe these conditions equally affect our competitors supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

  

backlog 

our backlog includes only firm unfilled orders expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months backlog was 169 billion  at december 31 2018  and 167 billion  at december 31 2017  

distribution and sales 

distribution and sales occur through direct sales offices manufacturers’ representatives and distributors in addition our medical  scientific imaging segment also sells through value added resellers “vars” and oems 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and related claims we are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

customers 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net revenues for 2018  for any of our segments or for our company as a whole 

competition 

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the size of the niche market we serve we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

patents and trademarks 

in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own or license the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with employees distributors representatives and customers to protect our trade secrets and knowhow we believe none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had 15611 employees with 10294 located in the united states we have 195 employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good

risk factors 

tableend 

risks relating to our business 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2018  we had 49 billion  in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 16 billion  undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 17  of our total net revenues for both the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net revenues these sales accounted for 11  of our net revenues for both the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2018  20  of our net revenues and 17  of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability 

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacture and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive 

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations 

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis computer viruses cyberattacks other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions 

a breach in the security of our software could harm our reputation result in a loss of current and potential customers and subject us to material claims which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our security measures are breached an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data in addition cyberattacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of customers’ data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countries 

regulatory authorities around the world have adopted and are considering further adoption of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united 

states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

any security breaches for which we are or are perceived to be responsible in whole or in part could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations which could harm our reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts any imposition of liability particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could materially harm our operating results and financial condition security breaches also could cause us to lose current and potential customers which could have an adverse effect on our business moreover we might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could in certain instances require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in some of our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business 

our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets and any writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2018  goodwill totaled 93 billion  compared to 77 billion  of stockholders’ equity and represented 61  of our total assets of 152 billion  the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating income any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

recent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team and the resulting management transitions could harm our operating results 

we have recently experienced significant changes to our executive leadership team leadership transitions and changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key leadership positions if we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and changes it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

all currency amounts are in millions unless specified 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 

  

overview 

we are a diversified technology company we operate businesses that design and develop software both license and softwareasaservice and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both new strategic platforms and additions to existing businesses 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018  included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived impairment analyses these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2018  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 173 and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 58 for a total of 231  or 32 of total gross accounts receivable as compared to a total of 127  or 19 of total gross accounts receivable at december 31 2017  this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2018  inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 

303  or 137  of gross inventory cost as compared to 381  or 157  of gross inventory cost at december 31 2017  the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory 

most of our productbased revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 to 24 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

revenues from our projectbased businesses including toll and traffic systems control systems and installations of large software application projects are generally recognized over time using the input method primarily utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs as the measure of performance the company recognized revenues of 2459  2493  and 2413  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively using this method at december 31 2018  2416 of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2018  our effective income tax rate was 212  as compared to the 2017  rate of 61  the increase was due primarily to the recognition of a 2154  net income tax benefit related to the tax act in 2017 partially offset by the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 we expect the effective tax rate for 2019 to be between 21 and 23 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required under the qualitative assessment we consider various qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions relevant industry and market trends cost factors overall financial performance other entityspecific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit 

we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value a noncash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess 

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances 

recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units 

roper has 33  reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero  to 24 billion  in 2018  the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units the company conducted its analysis qualitatively and 

assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount the company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 30  of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units for the remaining three  reporting units the company performed its quantitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of each of these three  reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of october 1 2018  

trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived trade name is less than its carrying amount if necessary we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a thirdparty would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using a riskadjusted rate of capital each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth 

the company performed a quantitative analysis over the fair values of four of its trade names and concluded that the fair value exceeded its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of october 1 2018  of those trade names subjected to our quantitative analysis one associated with our lab software business had a fair value that approximated its carrying value which was 1004 as of october 1 2018 holding other assumptions constant for the specific trade name associated with our lab software business a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a 68 impairment and a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an 117 impairment 

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses andor reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2018  

the most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships the fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future aftertax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets management considers historical customer attrition patterns 

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

corporate expenses increased by 617  to 2035  or 39  of revenues in 2018  as compared to 1418  or 31  of revenues in 2017  the increase was due primarily to i 350 of accelerated vesting associated with the passing of our former executive chairman ii increased equity compensation as a result of increases in our common stock price and iii acquisitionrelated expenses 

interest expense net increased 15  or 08  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  the increase was due to higher weighted average interest rates partially offset by lower weighted average debt balances

our medical  scientific imaging segment reported a 475 or 3 increase in net revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 over the year ended december 31 2016 all of which was attributable to organic growth the growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in our medical products businesses led by ndi and our alternate site healthcare businesses gross margin decreased to 720 for the year ended december 31 2017 from 732 for the year ended december 31 2016 due primarily to an unfavorable sales mix at both our software and medical products businesses sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 375 in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 382 in the year ended december 31 2016 due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales the resulting operating margin was 345 in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 350 in the year ended december 31 2016 

net revenues for our industrial technology segment increased by 771 or 11 for the year ended december 31 2017 from the year ended december 31 2016 all of which was attributable to organic growth the growth in organic revenues was broadbased due primarily to our fluid handling water meter technology and materials testing businesses gross margin was consistent at 506 for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 206 in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 219 in the year ended december 31 2016 due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume the resulting operating margin was 300 in the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 287 in the year ended december 31 2016

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

all currency amounts are in millions unless specified 

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  are as follows 



operating activities  the growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2018  and in 2017  was primarily due to increased earnings net of noncash expenses in addition the growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2017  over 2016  was increased in part by income tax payments in the first quarter of 2016 related to the gain on the sale of the abel pumps business in the fourth quarter of 2015 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities during 2018  was primarily for business acquisitions most notably powerplan and to a much lesser extent capital expenditures cash used in investing activities during 2017  was primarily for business acquisitions and capital expenditures cash used in investing activities during 2016  was primarily for business acquisitions most notably deltek 

financing activities  cash provided byused in financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repaymentsborrowings as well as dividends paid to stockholders cash used in financing activities during 2018 was primarily from the paydown of revolving debt borrowings of 405 partially offset by the net issuance of senior notes of 200 and dividends paid to shareholders cash used in financing activities during 2017 was primarily from the paydown of revolving debt borrowings of 660 and the repayment of 400 of senior notes cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was primarily from the issuance of 12 billion of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions 

cash and cash equivalents decreased as a result of the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes during the year ended december 31 2018  by 138  as compared to an increase during the year ended december 31 2017  of 592  and a decrease during the year ended december 31 2016  of 375  the decrease for the year ended december 31 2018  was due primarily to the weakening   

of functional currencies of our canadian and certain european subsidiaries against the us dollar while the increase for the year ended december 31 2017  was due primarily to the strengthening of functional currencies of our european subsidiaries against the us dollar the decrease for the year ended december 31 2016  was due primarily to the weakening of functional currencies of our european subsidiaries against the us dollar 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was a negative 200  at december 31 2018  compared to negative 140  at december 31 2017  due primarily to increased deferred revenue and accrued compensation partially offset by increased accounts receivable this deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscriptionbased services 

total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was 50 billion  at december 31 2018   391  of total capital compared to 52 billion  at december 31 2017   430  of total capital our decreased total debt at december 31 2018  compared to december 31 2017  was due primarily to the paydown of revolving debt borrowings of 405 the repayment at maturity of 800 of outstanding 205 senior unsecured notes and the redemption of 500 of outstanding 625 senior unsecured notes partially offset by the issuance of 700 of 365 senior unsecured notes and 800 of 420 senior unsecured notes 

on september 23 2016 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured credit facility the “2016 facility” with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility dated as of july 27 2012 as amended as of october 28 2015 the “2012 facility” the 2016 facility comprises a five year 25 billion  revolving credit facility which includes availability of up to 150  for letters of credit we may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 500  

the 2016 facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt enter into certain mergers and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 35 to 1 

on december 2 2016 we amended the 2016 facility to allow the consolidated total leverage ratio be increased no more than twice during the term of the 2016 facility to 40 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase or for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 425 to 1 pursuant to the 2016 facility amendment 425 to 1 in conjunction with the deltek acquisition see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 425 to 1 through june 30 2017 and 400 to 1 through december 31 2017 

at december 31 2018  we had 41 billion  of senior unsecured notes and 865  of outstanding revolver borrowings in addition we had 3  of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our nonus businesses we had 79  of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2018  of which 37  was covered by our lending group thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately 

we may redeem some or all of our senior secured notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  

see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes 

cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2018  totaled 339  as compared to 592  at december 31 2017  a decrease of 427  the decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of 472  during the year partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations the company intends to distribute all historical unremitted earnings up to the amount of foreign cash and cash equivalents as well as all future foreign earnings that can be repatriated without incremental us federal tax cost any remaining outside basis differences relating to the company’s investments in foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding income taxes 

capital expenditures of 491  488  and 373  were incurred during 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively capitalized software expenditures of 95  108  and 28  were incurred during 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively capital expenditures and capitalized 

software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2018 as compared to 2017 the increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due primarily to our 2016 acquisitions in the future we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 10 and 15 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

all currency amounts are in millions 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2018  





1 we have excluded the liability for uncertain tax positions and certain other tax liabilities as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

as of december 31 2018  we had 5826  of outstanding surety bonds certain contracts primarily those involving public sector customers require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations 

  

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2019 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

at december 31 2018  and 2017  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2018  we had 41 billion  of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 28 to 42 at december 31 2018  the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 01 and 07 higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments our credit facility contains a 25 billion  variablerate revolver with 865  of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2018  

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 17  of our total revenues in 2018  and 68 of these revenues were recognized by companies with a european functional currency if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2018  compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1 

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

our energy systems  controls segment principally produces control systems testing equipment valves and sensors for 2017  this segment had net revenues of 551 million  representing 120  of our total net revenues 

control systems   we manufacture control systems and provide related engineering and commissioning services for turbomachinery applications primarily in energy markets 

fluid properties testing equipment   we manufacture and sell test equipment to determine physical and elemental properties such as sulfur and nitrogen content flash point viscosity freeze point and distillation range of liquids and gases primarily for the petroleum industry 

sensors controls and valves   we manufacture sensors and control equipment including pressure sensors temperature sensors measurement instruments and control software for global rubber plastics and process industries we also manufacture and distribute valves sensors switches and control products used on engines compressors turbines and other powered equipment for the oil and gas pipeline power generation marine engine and general industrial markets many of these products are designed for use in hazardous environments 

nondestructive inspection and measurement instrumentation   we manufacture nondestructive inspection and measurement solutions including measurement probes robotics vibration sensors switches and transmitters these solutions are applied principally in nuclear energy markets many of these products are designed for use in hazardous environments 

the energy systems  controls segment companies revenues reflect a combination of standard products and large engineered projects standard products generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order and large engineered projects may have lead times of several months as such backlog may fluctuate depending upon the timing of large project awards 

materials and suppliers 

we believe most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe these conditions equally affect our competitors supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

  

backlog 

our backlog includes only firm unfilled orders expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months backlog was 17 billion  at december 31 2017  and 16 billion  at december 31 2016  

distribution and sales 

distribution and sales occur through direct sales offices manufacturers representatives and distributors in addition our medical  scientific imaging segment also sells through value added resellers vars and oems 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and related claims we are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

customers 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net revenues for 2017  for any of our segments or for our company as a whole 

competition 

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the size of the niche market we serve we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

patents and trademarks 

in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own or license the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with employees distributors representatives and customers to protect our trade secrets and knowhow we believe our operating units are not substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights 

employees

risk factors 

tableend 

risks relating to our business 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2017  we had 52 billion  in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 12 billion  undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 17 and 20 of our total net revenues for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported revenues and earnings 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net revenues these sales accounted for 11  of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  and 12 for the year ended december 31 2016  we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2017  20  of our net revenues and 18  of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability 

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers liability insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could reduce our revenues and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could in certain instances require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in some of our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become 

the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business 

our goodwill and intangible assets are a significant amount of our total assets and any writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2017  goodwill totaled 88 billion  compared to 69 billion  of stockholders equity and represented 62  of our total assets of 143 billion  the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating earnings any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that we maintain our margin profile this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations 

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis computer viruses cyberattacks other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to perform necessary business functions 

a breach in the security of our software could harm our reputation result in a loss of current and potential customers and subject us to material claims which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

if our security measures are breached an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users or customers data in addition cyberattacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of customers data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countries 

regulatory authorities around the world have adopted and are considering further adoptions of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner 

that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

any security breaches for which we are or are perceived to be responsible in whole or in part could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations which could harm our reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts any imposition of liability particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could materially harm our operating results and financial condition security breaches also could cause us to lose current and potential customers which could have an adverse effect on our business moreover we might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 

  

overview 

we are a diversified technology company we operate businesses that design and develop software both license and softwareasaservice and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017  included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percentageofcompletion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived impairment analyses these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2017  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 103 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 24 million for a total of 127 million  or 19 of total gross accounts receivable as compared to a total of 145 million  or 23 of total gross accounts receivable at december 31 2016  this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2017  inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 381 million  or 157  of gross inventory cost as compared to 372 million  or 170  of gross inventory cost at december 31 

2016  the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory 

most of our productbased revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 to 24 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we recognized revenue of 249 million 241 million and 253 million respectively using this method percentageofcompletion is used primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects at december 31 2017  253 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2017  our effective income tax rate was 61  as compared to the 2016  rate of 300  the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a 215 million net income tax benefit related to the tax act as well as increased excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016 we expect the effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 21 and 23 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required under the qualitative assessment we consider various qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions relevant industry and market trends cost factors overall financial performance other entityspecific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit 

we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value a noncash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess 

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances 

recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units 

we have 33 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to 23 billion in 2017  we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units we conducted our analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount we determined that 

impairment of goodwill was not likely in 31 of our reporting units and thus we were not required to perform a quantitative analysis for these reporting units for the remaining two reporting units the company performed its quantitative analysis and concluded that the fair value of each of these two reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of october 1 2017 

business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived trade name is less than its carrying amount if necessary we conduct a quantitative review using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a thirdparty would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using a riskadjusted rate of capital each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth 

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2017  

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

our medical  scientific imaging segment reported a 475 million  or 3  increase in net revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  over the year ended december 31 2016  all of which was attributable to organic growth the growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in our medical products businesses led by ndi and our alternate site healthcare businesses gross margin decreased to 720  for the year ended december 31 2017  from 732  for the year ended december 31 2016  due primarily to an unfavorable sales mix at both our software and medical products businesses sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 375  in the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 382  in the year ended december 31 2016  due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales the resulting operating margin was 345  in the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 350  in the year ended december 31 2016

in our energy systems  controls segment net revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  increased by 411 million  or 8  from the year ended december 31 2016  organic sales increased by 7  and the benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions totaled 1 the growth in organic revenues was due primarily to increased sales in pressure sensors and valves businesses serving energy markets as well as businesses serving industrial end markets gross margin increased to 574  in the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 571  in the year ended december 31 2016  and sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 300  in the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 317  in the year ended december 31 2016  both of which were due to operating leverage on higher sales volume as a result operating margin was 274  in the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 254  in the year ended december 31 2016  

corporate expenses increased by 143 million  to 1418 million  or 31  of revenues in 2017  as compared to 1275 million  or 34  of revenues in 2016  the dollar increase was due primarily to increased incentive compensation and professional services 

interest expense increased 690 million  or 619  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund acquisitions at the end of 2016 

other income net of 50 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  was composed primarily of a 94 million gain on sale of a product line in our energy systems  controls segment offset in part by a 18 million charge on a minority investment and foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies other expense of 15 million for the year ended december 31 2016 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies offset in part by royalty income 

during 2017  our effective income tax rate was 61  as compared to our 2016  rate of 300  the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a 215 million net income tax benefit related to the tax act as well as increased excess tax benefits related to equity compensation in 2017 as compared to 2016

in our energy systems  controls segment net revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased by 78 million or 13 from the year ended december 31 2015 organic revenues decreased by 12 due to decreased sales in oil and gas products including safety systems and valves and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1 gross margin decreased to 571 in the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 581 in the year ended december 31 2015 and sga expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 317 as compared to 305 in the prior year both of which were due to negative leverage on lower sales volume operating margin was 254 in the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 276 in the year ended december 31 2015 

corporate expenses increased by 247 million to 1275 million or 34 of net revenues in 2016 as compared to 1028 million or 29 of net revenues in 2015 the increase was due primarily to increased equity compensation costs as a result of both an increase in the number of shares granted in the current year and increases in our common stock price and increased costs related to acquisitions 

interest expense increased 273 million or 325 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund current year acquisitions as well as higher average interest rates throughout 2016 

other expense of 15 million for the year ended december 31 2016 was composed primarily of foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies offset in part by royalty income other income of 587 million for the year ended december 31 2015 was composed primarily of the 709 million gain from the divestiture of abel pumps see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report offset in part by a 95 million impairment charge on a minority investment 

during 2016 our effective income tax rate was 300 which was 60 basis points lower than the 2015 rate of 306 the decrease was due to the recognition of 153 million in excess tax benefits in the current year in accordance with an asu related to stock compensation adopted in the first quarter of 2016 see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report as well as the nonrecurrence of the 2015 taxable gain on the divestiture of abel pumps which was partially offset by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters in 2015

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  are as follows in millions 



operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2017  and in 2016  was primarily due to increased earnings net of noncash expenses and higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016  was offset in part by income tax payments in the first quarter of 2016 related to the gain on the sale of the abel pumps business in the fourth quarter of 2015 

investing activities  cash used in investing activities during 2017  2016  and 2015  was primarily for business acquisitions cash received from investing activities in 2015 was primarily proceeds from the sale of the abel pumps business 

financing activities  cash used inprovided by financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repaymentsborrowings as well as dividends paid to stockholders cash used in financing activities during 2017 was primarily from the paydown of revolving debt borrowings of 660 million and the repayment of 400 million of senior notes cash provided by financing activities during 2016 was primarily from the issuance of 12 billion of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions 

cash and cash equivalents increased as a result of the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes during the year ended december 31 2017  by 59 million  as compared to decreases during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  of 38 million  and 59 million  respectively the increase for the year ended december 31 2017  was due primarily to the strengthening of functional currencies of our european subsidiaries against the us dollar while the decreases for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  were due primarily to the weakening of functional currencies of our european subsidiaries against the us dollar 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was a negative 140 million  at december 31 2017  compared to negative 25 million  at december 31 2016  due primarily to increased deferred revenues this deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscriptionbased services along with the impact of fair value purchase accounting resulting from 2016 acquisitions 

total debt was 52 billion  at december 31 2017   430  of total capital compared to 62 billion  at december 31 2016   518  of total capital our decreased debt at december 31 2017  compared to december 31 2016  was due primarily to the paydown of revolving debt borrowings of 660 million and the repayment of 400 million of senior notes 

on september 23 2016 we entered into a fiveyear unsecured credit facility the 2016 facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility dated as of july 27 2012 as amended as of october 28 2015 the 2012 facility the 2016 facility comprises a five year 25 billion  revolving credit facility which includes availability of up to 150 million  for letters of credit we may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 500 million  

the 2016 facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt enter into certain mergers and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 35 to 1 

on december 2 2016 we amended the 2016 facility to allow the consolidated total leverage ratio be increased no more than twice during the term of the 2016 facility to 40 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase or for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 425 to 1 pursuant to the 2016 facility amendment 425 to 1 in conjunction with the deltek acquistion see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 425 to 1 through june 30 2017 and 400 to 1 through december 31 2017 

at december 31 2017  we had 39 billion  of senior unsecured notes and 13 billion  of outstanding revolver borrowings in addition we had 31 million  of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our nonus businesses we had 759 million  of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2017  of which 331 million  was covered by our lending group thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately 

we may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  

see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes 

cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2017  totaled 592 million the tax act included a onetime deemed mandatory repatriation tax on all undistributed foreign earnings resulting in a charge of 1107 million  as of december 31 2017  the company will elect to pay the liability over 8  years in addition the introduction of a modified territorial taxation system resulted in a onetime estimated charge of 287 million  due to the company’s change in its indefinite reinvestment assertion on foreign earnings the company now intends to distribute all historical earnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax and has provided for deferred taxes related to the future state and foreign tax cost to repatriate see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding income taxes 

capital expenditures of 488 million  373 million  and 363 million  were incurred during 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively capitalized software expenditures of 108 million  28 million  and 24 million  were incurred during 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increases in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due primarily to our 2016 acquisitions in the future we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 10 and 15 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2017  in thousands 





1 we have excluded the liability for uncertain tax positions and other income tax liabilities resulting from the tax act considered provisional see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

as of december 31 2017  we had 5734 million  of outstanding surety bonds certain contracts primarily those involving public sector customers require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations 

  

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2018 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

at december 31 2017  and 2016  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

tableend 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2017  we had 39 billion  of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 205 to 625 at december 31 2017  the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 005 higher and 385 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments our credit facility contains a 25 billion  variablerate revolver with 127 billion  of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2017  

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner net revenues recognized by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 17 of our total revenues in 2017  and 68 of these revenues were recognized by companies with a european functional currency if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2017  compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 1 

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

nondestructive inspection and measurement instrumentation  we manufacture nondestructive inspection and measurement solutions including measurement probes robotics vibration sensors switches and transmitters these solutions are applied principally in nuclear energy markets many of these products are designed for use in hazardous environments

the energy systems  controls segment companies sales reflect a combination of standard products and large engineered projects standard products generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order and large engineered projects may have lead times of several months as such backlog may fluctuate depending upon the timing of large project awards

materials and suppliers

we believe most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe these conditions equally affect our competitors supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions

 

backlog

our backlog includes only firm unfilled orders expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months backlog was 16 billion at december 31 2016 and 11 billion at december 31 2015

distribution and sales

distribution and sales occur through direct sales offices manufacturers representatives and distributors in addition our medical  scientific imaging segment also sells through value added resellers vars and oems

environmental matters and other governmental regulation

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and related claims we are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities

customers

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales for 2016 for any of our segments or for our company as a whole

competition

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the size of the niche market we serve we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and customer service capabilities

patents and trademarks

in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own or license the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with employees distributors representatives and customers to protect our trade secrets and knowhow we believe our operating units are not substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights

 item 1a risk factors

tableend 

risks relating to our business

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility

as of december 31 2016 we had 62 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 535 million undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 20 of our total net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for 12 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 and 13 for the year ended december 31 2015 we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business

as of and for the year ended december 31 2016 21 of our net sales and 13 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to adequately protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers liability insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results

 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business

our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2016 goodwill totaled 86 billion compared to 58 billion of stockholders equity and represented 60 of our total assets of 143 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating earnings any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis computer viruses cyberattacks other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions

with the types of licensing vehicles we use to deliver our products to market including subscription and ondemand pricing for our software and services the recognition of revenue for the products and services we sell could be delayed from one period to another

as we continue to vary the ways in which we deliver our products to the market including expanded use of subscription term and saas offerings we may be required under existing accounting rules to defer the recognition of revenue from one period to another the deferral of perpetual licenses revenue may result in significant timing differences between the completion of a sale and the actual recognition of the revenue related to that sale as a result the revenue we recognize in a particular period may not be reflective of our actual success in selling our products and solutions in the market

offering our products on a saas basis presents execution risks

we offer a number of our products in a saasbased environment and we expect to expand those offerings in the future as more of our solutions are delivered as saasbased solutions it is uncertain whether our strategies will generate the revenue required to be successful any significant costs we incur may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including ensuring that our saasbased offerings meet the performance reliability and cost expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data if we are unable to execute on this strategy our revenue or financial results may be materially adversely affected

a breach in the security of our software could harm our reputation result in a loss of current and potential customers and subject us to material claims which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition

if our security measures are breached an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users or customers data in addition cyberattacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customers data because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countries

regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

any security breaches for which we are or are perceived to be responsible in whole or in part could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations which could harm our reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts any imposition of liability particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could materially harm our operating results and financial condition security breaches also could cause us to lose current and potential customers which could have an adverse effect on our business moreover we might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to protect further against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report

 

overview

we are a diversified technology company we operate businesses that design and develop software both license and softwareasaservice and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets including healthcare transportation commercial construction food energy water education and academic research

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms

in 2016 we acquired clinisys group ltd clinisys pci medical inc geneinsight inc isqft holdings inc dba constructconnect constructconnect uniconnect lc and project diamond holdings corp dba deltek inc the acquisitions both expanded and complemented our existing technologies

application of critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016 included in this annual report

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percentageofcompletion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2016 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 122 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 23 million for a total of 145 million or 23 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2016 was 21 million higher than at december 31 2015 the allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business the writeoff of uncollectible receivables and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2016 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 372 million or 170 of gross inventory cost as compared to 340 million or 152 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2015 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 to 24 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we recognized revenue of 241 million 253 million and 266 million respectively using this method percentageofcompletion is used primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects at december 31 2016 260 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2016 our effective income tax rate was 300 which was 60 basis points lower than the 2015 rate of 306 the decrease was due to the recognition of 153 million in excess tax benefits in the current year in accordance with an accounting standards update related to stock compensation adopted in the first quarter of 2016 see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the nonrecurrence of the 2015 taxable gain on the divestiture of abel pumps which was partially offset by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters in 2015 we expect the effective tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 30

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value

when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform the twostep quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required under the qualitative assessment we consider various qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions relevant industry and market trends cost factors overall financial performance other entityspecific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit

we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test the first step utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances

we have 33 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to 22 billion in 2016 we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units excluding those acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016 we conducted our analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount we determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 28 of our reporting units and thus we were not required to perform a quantitative analysis for these reporting units for the remaining five reporting units we performed our quantitative analysis and concluded that the fair value of each of these five reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of december 31 2016 recently acquired reporting units generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units

business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if necessary we conduct a quantitative review using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a riskadjusted rate of capital each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2016

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

corporate expenses increased by 247 million to 1275 million or 34 of sales in 2016 as compared to 1028 million or 29 of sales in 2015 the increase was due primarily to increased equity compensation costs as a result of both an increase in the number of shares granted in the current year and increases in our common stock price and increased costs related to acquisitions

interest expense increased 273 million or 325 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances to fund current year acquisitions as well as higher average interest rates throughout 2016

during 2016 our effective income tax rate was 300 which was 60 basis points lower than the 2015 rate of 306 the decrease was due to the recognition of 153 million in excess tax benefits in the current year in accordance with an asu related to stock compensation adopted in the first quarter of 2016 see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the nonrecurrence of the 2015 taxable gain on the divestiture of abel pumps which was partially offset by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters in 2015

at december 31 2016 the functional currencies of most of our nonus su bsidiaries were weaker and the canadian dollar was stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2015 the net result of these changes led to a pretax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 115 m illion in the year ended december 31 2016 approximate ly 52 mil lion of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2016 operating profit decreased by less than 1 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies

financial condition liquidity and capital resources

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 are as follows in millions

 

operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily due to increased earnings net of noncash charges and higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products offset in part by income tax payments in the first quarter of 2016 related to the gain on the sale of the abel pumps business in the fourth quarter of 2015 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions the collection of 49 million of receivables due from the puerto rico highways and transportation authority and higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products

investing activities  cash used in investing activities during 2016 2015 and 2014 was primarily for business acquisitions cash received from investing activities in 2015 was primarily proceeds from the sale of the abel pumps business

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was a negative 25 million at december 31 2016 compared to 126 million at december 31 2015 due primarily to increases in deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products we acquired negative net working capital of 128 million through business acquisitions during 2016 the negative acquired working capital was due primarily to 203 million in deferred revenue balances

total debt was 62 billion at december 31 2016 518 of total capital compared to 33 billion at december 31 2015 383 of total capital our increased debt at december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 was due to debt borrowings for 2016 acquisitions

on december 19 2016 we completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 280 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2021 issued at 99843 of their principal amount and 700 million aggregate principal amount of 380 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2026 issued at 99984 of their principal amount net proceeds of 119 billion were used in the acquisition of deltek see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries

the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 280 and 380 per year respectively payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year beginning june 15 2017

we may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities

on september 23 2016 we entered into a new fiveyear unsecured credit facility the 2016 facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility dated as of july 27 2012 as amended as of october 28 2015 the 2012 facility the 2016 facility comprises a five year 250 billion revolving credit facility which includes availability of up to 1500 million for letters of credit we may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 500 million we recorded as other expense a 09 million noncash debt extinguishment charge in the fourth quarter related to the early termination of the 2012 facility which represented the unamortized fees associated with the 2012 facility

the 2016 facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt enter into certain mergers and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 35 to 1

on december 2 2016 we amended the 2016 facility to allow the consolidated total leverage ratio be increased no more than twice during the term of the 2016 facility to 40 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase or for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 425 to 1 pursuant to the 2016 facility amendment 425 to 1 in conjunction with the deltek acquistion see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 425 to 1 through june 30 2017 and 400 to 1 through december 31 2017

at december 31 2016 we had 43 billion of senior unsecured notes and 193 billion of outstanding revolver borrowings in addition we had 30 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our nonus businesses we had 741 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2016 of which 348 million was covered by our lending group thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015

see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes

cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2016 totaled 557 million repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes we consider this cash to be permanently reinvested we expect existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated by our us operations our unsecured credit facility as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the us for the foreseeable future

capital expenditures of 373 million 363 million and 376 million were incurred during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively in the future we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 10 and 15 of annual net sales

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2016 in thousands

 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2016 we had 521 million of outstanding surety bonds certain contracts primarily those involving public sector customers require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations

 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2017 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

offbalance sheet arrangements

 

at december 31 2016 and 2015 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

tableend 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock

at december 31 2016 we had 43 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 185 to 625 at december 31 2016 the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 09 higher and 29 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments our credit facility contains a 25 billion variablerate revolver with 193 billion of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2016

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated i n euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 20 of our total sales in 2016 an d 61 o f these sales were by companies with a european functional currency if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2016 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 2

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

risks relating to our business

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility

as of december 31 2015 we had 329 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 17 billion undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 20 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 23 for the year ended december 31 2014 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for 13 of our net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business

as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 21 of our net sales and 14 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers liability insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility distribution channel access and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business

our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2015 goodwill totaled 58 billion compared to 53 billion of stockholders equity and represented 57 of our total assets of 102 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating earnings any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis computer viruses cyberattacks other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report

 

overview

we are a diversified technology company we operate businesses that design and develop software both license and softwareasaservice and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets including healthcare transportation food energy water education and academic research

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms

in 2015 we acquired strata decision technologies llc strata softwriters inc data innovations llc on center software llc on center rf ideas inc atlantic health partners llc ahp aderant holdings inc aderant and atlas database software corp atlas the acquisitions both expanded and complemented our existing technologies   we also divested abel pumps and black diamond advanced technologies in the current year

application of critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 included in this annual report

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percentageofcompletion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2015 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 100 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 24 million for a total of 124 million or 25 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2015 was 13 million lower than at december 31 2014 the allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business the writeoff of uncollectible receivables and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2015 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 340 million or 152 of gross inventory cost as compared to 389 million or 167 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2014 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 to 24 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 we recognized revenue of 253 million 266 million and 205 million respectively using this method percentageofcompletion is used primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects at december 31 2015 276 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2015 our effective income tax rate was 306 which was 70 basis points higher than the 2014 rate of 299 the taxable gain on the divestiture of abel pumps led to an increase of 130 basis points and was offset in part by discrete tax benefits from settlements of tax matters we expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2016 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions primarily the us

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value

when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not we are then required to perform the twostep quantitative impairment test otherwise no further analysis is required under the qualitative assessment we consider various qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions relevant industry and market trends cost factors overall financial performance other entityspecific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit

we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test the first step utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances

we have 32 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to 12 billion in 2015 we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units we conducted our analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount we determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 29 of our reporting units and thus we were not required to perform a quantitative analysis for these reporting units for the remaining three reporting units we performed our quantitative analysis and concluded that the fair value of each of these three reporting units was in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of december 31 2015 negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units

business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if necessary we conduct a quantitative review using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a riskadjusted rate of capital each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2015

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

financial condition liquidity and capital resources

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 are as follows in millions

 

operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions and the collection of 49 million of receivables due from the puerto rico highways and transportation authority offset in part by higher deferred revenue balances due to an increased percentage of revenue from software and other subscription based products the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 was primarily due to increased earnings net of intangible amortization related to acquisitions offset in part by tax payments

investing activities  cash used in investing activities during 2015 2014 and 2013 was primarily for business acquisitions cash received from investing activities in 2015 was primarily proceeds from the sale of the abel pumps business

financing activities  cash used in financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily from the issuance of 900 million of senior notes and revolving debt borrowings for acquisitions cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was primarily revolving debt borrowing for acquisitions offset in part by debt payments made using cash from operations

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 126 million at december 31 2015 compared to 285 million at december 31 2014 due primarily to a net reduction in net working capital of 50 million due to the reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and a 49 million decrease in receivables related to the collection of amounts due from the puerto rico highways and transportation authority we acquired negative net working capital of 13 million through business acquisitions during 2015 the negative acquired working capital was due primarily to 69 million in deferred revenue balances

total debt was 33 billion at december 31 2015 383 of total capital compared to 22 billion at december 31 2014 318 of total capital our increased debt at december 31 2015 compared to december 31 2014 was due to debt borrowings for 2015 acquisitions

on december 7 2015 we completed a public offering of 600 million aggregate principal amount of 300 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2020 issued at 99962 of their principal amount and 300 million aggregate principal amount of 385 senior unsecured notes due december 15 2025 issued at 99362 of their principal amount net proceeds of 894 million were used to pay off a portion of the outstanding revolver balance under our 185 billion revolving credit facility the senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank senior in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries

the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 300 and 385 per year respectively payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year beginning june 15 2016

we may redeem some or all of these notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities

at december 31 2015 we had 31 billion of senior unsecured notes 180 million of outstanding revolver borrowings and 4 million of senior subordinated convertible notes in addition we had 4 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our nonus businesses we had 43 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2015 of which 39 million was covered by our lending group thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014

see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding our credit facility senior notes and senior subordinated convertible notes

cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2015 totaled 688 million repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes we consider this cash to be permanently reinvested we expect existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated by our us operations our unsecured credit facility as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the us for the foreseeable future

capital expenditures of 363 million 376 million and 425 million were incurred during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in the future we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 10 and 15 of annual net sales

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2015 in thousands

 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2015 we had 505 million of outstanding surety bonds certain contracts primarily those involving public sector customers require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations

 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2016 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

offbalance sheet arrangements

 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock

at december 31 2015 we had 31 billion of fixed rate borrowings with interest rates ranging from 185 to 625 at december 31 2015 the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 14 higher and 24 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments our credit facility contains a 185 billion variablerate revolver with 180 million of outstanding borrowings at december 31 2015

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated i n euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 20 of our total sales in 2015 an d 61 o f these sales were by companies with a european functional currency if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2015 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 16

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

nondestructive inspection and measurement instrumentation  we manufacture nondestructive inspection and measurement solutions including measurement probes robotics vibration sensors switches and transmitters these solutions are applied principally in nuclear energy markets many of these products are designed for use in hazardous environments

the energy systems and controls segment companies sales reflect a combination of standard products and large engineered projects standard products generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order and large engineered projects may have lead times of several months as such backlog may fluctuate depending upon the timing of large project awards

materials and suppliers

we believe most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe these conditions equally affect our competitors supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions

 

backlog

our policy is to include only firm unfilled orders shippable within twelve months in backlog backlog was 104 billion at december 31 2014 and 105 billion at december 31 2013

distribution and sales

distribution and sales occur through direct sales offices manufacturers representatives and distributors in addition our medical and scientific imaging segment also sells through value added resellers vars and oems

environmental matters and other governmental regulation

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including those governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and related claims we are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities

customers

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales for 2014 for any of our segments or for our company as a whole

competition

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the size of the niche market we serve we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities

patents and trademarks

in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own or license the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with employees distributors representatives and customers to protect our trade secrets and knowhow we believe our operating units are not substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights

 item 1a risk factors tableend 

risks relating to our business

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility

as of december 31 2014 we had 221 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 15 billion undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments under our credit facility not to exceed 350 million in aggregate our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness

 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may harm our business

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 23 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 24 for the year ended december 31 2013 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for 13 and 15 of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business

as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 25 of our net sales and 19 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers liability insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency in july 2014 puerto rico passed the public corporation debt enforcement and recovery act which may impact the future prospects of our customer the puerto rico highways  transportation authority at the present time we believe that existing contracts and payable obligations will be honored

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business

our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2014 goodwill totaled 471 billion compared to 476 billion of stockholders equity and represented 56 of our total assets of 841 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating earnings any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis computer viruses cyberattacks other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report

 

overview

we are a diversified technology company we operate businesses that design and develop software both license and softwareasaservice and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets including healthcare transportation food energy water education and academic research

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both additions to existing businesses and new strategic platforms

in the third quarter of 2014 we acquired the shares of foodlink holdings inc foodlink innovative product achievements llc ipa and strategic healthcare programs holdings llc shp which expand upon our existing supply chain and medical platforms

application of critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014 included in this annual report

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percentageofcompletion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2014 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 108 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 29 million for a total of 137 million or 26 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2014 was 13 million lower than at december 31 2013 the allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business the writeoff of uncollectible receivables and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2014 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 389 million or 167 of gross inventory cost as compared to 435 million or 175 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2013 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 to 24 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we recognized revenue of 266 million 205 million and 146 million respectively using this method percentageofcompletion is used primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application projects at december 31 2014 225 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2014 our effective income tax rate was 299 which was higher than the 2013 rate of 286 due to an increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the nonrecurrence of 6 million in tax benefits recognized in 2013 related in part to the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 atra on january 2 2013 we expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2015 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions primarily the us

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value using a twostep process the first step utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances

we have 29 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to 994 million we concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of december 31 2014 negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units

in 2013 we reported that the fair value of one of our reporting units in the rf technology segment was less than 5 above its carrying value at december 31 2013 using the discounted cash flow methodology but that we believed that the market value of the unit to be significantly in excess of its carrying value based upon observed market data the test performed in december 2014 indicated that the fair value of this unit at december 31 2014 exceeded the carrying value by more than 20

business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted rate of capital each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2014

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

net sales for our industrial technology segment decreased by 16 million or 2 for the year ended december 31 2013 over the year ended december 31 2012 the decrease was due primarily to the loss of a customer at our water metering business and lower sales at our materials testing business gross margin was 511 for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 516 in the year ended december 31 2012 due to negative operating leverage on lower sales volume as well as the inclusion in 2012 of a onetime 55 million reduction to cost of goods sold at one of our businesses sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 225 as compared to 208 in the prior year due primarily to a 91 million pretax charge for warranty expense at one of our subsidiaries hansen technologies to provide its customers with replacements for refrigeration valves that included a vendorsupplied component that did not meet roper quality standards the resulting operating margin was 286 in the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 308 in the year ended december 31 2012

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 increased by 6 million or 1 over the year ended december 31 2012 due primarily to acquisitions organic sales were impacted by lower sales of nondestructive testing systems for nuclear plants and pressure sensors for industrial applications offset by increased demand for control systems for oil and gas applications gross margin was 574 in the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 563 in the year ended december 31 2012 due to product mix sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 292 as compared to 284 in the prior year due to product mix operating margin was 282 in the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 278 in the year ended december 31 2012

corporate expenses increased by 86 million to 861 million or 27 of sales in 2013 as compared to 775 million or 26 of sales in 2012 the increase was due to higher equity compensation primarily as a result of higher stock prices offset in part by a decrease in acquisitionrelated expenses

other expense of 02 million for the year ended december 31 2013 was composed of foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies offset in part by proceeds from a legal settlement other expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was 23 million primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies

during 2013 our effective income tax rate was 286 versus 296 in 2012 the reduction was due to 6 million in discrete tax benefits related to the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 atra as well as a 6 million benefit from the correction of an out of period adjustment of tax balances which were immaterial to any covered period offset in part by increased revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions primarily the us we expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2014 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the nonrecurrence of the 6 million tax benefit recognized in 2013

at december 31 2013 the functional currencies of most of our european subsidiaries were stronger and our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries were weaker against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2012 the net result of these changes led to a pretax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 179 million in the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 95 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2013 operating profit decreased by less than 1 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies

the following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 dollar amounts in thousands

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 are as follows in millions

cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2014 totaled 535 million repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes we consider this cash to be permanently reinvested we expect existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated by our us operations our unsecured credit facility as well as our expected ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the us for the foreseeable future

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the year ended december 31 2014

capital expenditures of 376 million 425 million and 384 million were incurred during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively in the future we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 10 and 15 of annual net sales

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from longterm to shortterm debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon our common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2014 in thousands

 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2014 we had 428 million of outstanding surety bonds certain contracts primarily those involving public sector customers require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of its performance of contractual obligations

 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2014 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

 

offbalance sheet arrangements

 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock

at december 31 2014 we had 22 billion of fixed rate borrowings our 400 million senior notes due 2017 800 million senior notes due 2018 500 million senior notes due 2019 and 500 million senior notes due 2022 have fixed interest rates of 1850 2050 3125 and 6250 respectively and our 8 million senior subordinated convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375 at december 31 2014 the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 08 higher and 28 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments our credit facility contains a 15 billion variablerate revolver with no outstanding borrowings at december 31 2014

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated i n euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish kroner sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 23 of our total sales in 2014 an d 61 o f these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar was stronger against most of our nonus subsidiary currencies throughout most of 2014 as compared to 2013 which resulted in a decrease in sales of less than 10 due to foreign currency exchange if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2014 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 17

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar at december 31 2014 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2013 resulted in a pretax decrease in net assets of 1189 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 505 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

 item 1a   risk factors 

risks relating to our business

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility

as of december 31 2013 we had 246 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 12 billion undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments under our credit facility not to exceed 350 million in aggregate our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish krone sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 24 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 25 for the year ended december 31 2012 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for 15 of our net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business

as of and for the year ended december 31 2013 26 of our net sales and 21 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers liability insurance we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive

 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business

our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2013 goodwill totaled 455 billion compared to 421 billion of stockholders equity and represented 56 of our total assets of 818 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating earnings any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful

we rely on information and technology for many of our business operations which could fail and cause disruption to our business operations

our business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit process and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with clients and vendors a shutdown of or inability to access one or more of our facilities a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis computer viruses cyberattacks other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information corruption of data or operational disruption if sustained or repeated such a business interruption system failure service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report

overview

we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes medical and scientific imaging products and software radio frequency rf products services and application software industrial technology products and energy systems and controls products and solutions we market these products and services to a broad range of markets including rf applications medical water energy research education softwareasaservice saasbased information networks security and other niche markets

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms

on may 1 2013 we purchased the shares of managed health care associates inc mha a leading provider of services and technologies to support the diverse and complex needs of alternate site health care providers who deliver services outside of an acute care hospital setting the acquisition of mha complements and expands our medical software and services platform on october 4 2013 we acquired the shares of advanced sensors ltd advanced sensors which manufactures oilinwater analyzers for the oil and gas industries

application of critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percentageofcompletion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2013 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 114 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 36 million for a total of 150 million or 28 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2013 was 10 million lower than at december 31 2012 the allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business the writeoff of uncollectible receivables and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2013 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 435 million or 175 of gross inventory cost as compared to 420 million or 180 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2012 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized revenue of 2050 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects and installations of large software application products we recognized 1455 million and 1515 million of revenue using this method during the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 respectively at december 31 2013 2221 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2013 our effective income tax rate was 286 which was slightly lower than the 2012 rate of 296 due in part to the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 atra on january 2 2013 which retroactively reinstated and extended certain tax provisions to january 1 2012 as a result our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 included discrete tax benefits totaling 6 million we expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2014 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the nonrecurrence of the 6 million tax benefit taken in 2013

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value using a twostep process the first step utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized

key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances

we have 28 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to 988 million we concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of december 31 2013 however the fair value of one of our reporting units in the rf technology segment was less than 5 above its carrying value at december 31 2013 using the discounted cash flow methodology the decrease from the prior years results was due to lower growth assumptions in the current years testing the weighted average cost of capital utilized in 2013 was consistent with the prior years testing we believe the market value of this unit to be significantly in excess of its carrying value based upon observed market data negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units

business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted rate of capital each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2013 however the fair value of the trade names of one of our reporting units in the rf technology segment could have fallen below the carrying value at december 31 2013 had the assumed sales growth been less than that used in the assessment we do not believe that impairment is probable however it is possible that the trade name could become impaired in the future at which point we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying level of the trade name at the reporting unit

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

year ended december 31 2013 compared to year ended december 31 2012

net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 were 324 billion as compared to sales of 299 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 an increase of 8 the increase was the result of contributions from acquisitions of 7 and organic sales growth of 1

our medical and scientific imaging segment reported a 198 million or 28 increase in net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 over the year ended december 31 2012 acquisitions added 208 million in sales while organic sales decreased 1 due to a 20 million decrease in camera sales which was offset in part by increased sales in our medical businesses of 15 million gross margin increased to 693 in the year ended december 31 2013 from 644 in the year ended december 31 2012 due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 395 in the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 378 in the year ended december 31 2012 due to higher sga expense structures at our medical businesses as well as sga expenses at mha in which the corresponding revenues were not recognizable under gaap see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report operating margin was 297 in the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 266 in the year ended december 31 2012

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 increased by 56 million or 7 over the year ended december 31 2012 the increase was due primarily to growth in our toll and traffic university card systems and security solutions businesses gross margin was 537 in 2013 as compared to 524 in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume sga expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended december 31 2013 were 256 a decrease from 261 in the prior year due to operating leverage on higher sales volume operating profit margin was 280 in 2013 as compared to 263 in 2012

net sales for our industrial technology segment decreased by 16 million or 2 for the year ended december 31 2013 over the year ended december 31 2012 the decrease was due primarily to the loss of a customer at our water metering business and lower sales at our materials testing business gross margin was 511 for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 516 in the year ended december 31 2012 due to negative operating leverage on lower sales volume as well as the inclusion in 2012 of a onetime 55 million reduction to cost of goods sold at one of our businesses sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 225 as compared to 208 in the prior year due primarily to a 91 million pretax charge for warranty expense at one of our subsidiaries hansen technologies to provide its customers with replacements for refrigeration valves that included a vendorsupplied component that did not meet roper quality standards the resulting operating profit margin was 286 in the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 308 in the year ended december 31 2012

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 increased by 6 million or 1 over the year ended december 31 2012 due primarily to acquisitions organic sales were impacted by lower sales of nondestructive testing systems for nuclear plants and pressure sensors for industrial applications offset by increased demand for control systems for oil and gas applications gross margin was 574 in the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 563 in the year ended december 31 2012 due to product mix sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 292 as compared to 284 in the prior year due to product mix operating profit margin was 282 in the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 278 in the year ended december 31 2012

corporate expenses increased by 86 million to 861 million or 27 of sales in 2013 as compared to 775 million or 26 of sales in 2012 the increase was due to higher equity compensation primarily as a result of higher stock prices offset in part by a decrease in acquisitionrelated expenses

interest expense increased 205 million or 304 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 the increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2013

other expense of 02 million for the year ended december 31 2013 was composed of foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies offset in part by proceeds from a legal settlement other expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was 23 million primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies

during 2013 our effective income tax rate was 286 versus 296 in 2012 the reduction was due to 6 million in discrete tax benefits related to the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 atra as well as a 6 million benefit from the correction of an out of period adjustment of tax balances which were immaterial to any covered period offset in part by increased revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions primarily the united states we expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2014 due to a continued increase in revenues and resulting pretax income in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the nonrecurrence of the 6 million tax benefit taken in 2013

at december 31 2013 the functional currencies of most of our european subsidiaries were stronger and our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries were weaker against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2012 the net result of these changes led to a pretax decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 179 million in the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 95 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2013 operating profit decreased by less than 1 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies

the following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 dollar amounts in thousands   

 

the increase in orders was due to internal growth of 4 as well as orders from acquisitions which added 8 our energy systems and controls and rf technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2013 our medical and scientific imaging segment experienced internal growth of 3 as well as orders from recent acquisitions

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased by 3 million over the year ended december 31 2011 organic sales were flat as growth in toll and traffic systems was offset by a large installation project in gas network monitoring during 2011 that has since been completed gross margin was 524 in 2012 as compared to 506 in the prior year due to product mix sga expenses as a percentage of sales in the year ended december 31 2012 were 261 a decrease from 268 in the prior year due to lower spending particularly in selling expense related to toll projects operating profit margin was 263 in 2012 as compared to 238 in 2011

corporate expenses increased by 206 million to 775 million or 26 of sales in 2012 as compared to 569 million or 20 of sales in 2011 the increase was due to 65 million of acquisition expense related to the sunquest acquisition higher equity compensation as a result of higher stock prices and other compensation related costs

interest expense increased 39 million or 61 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2012

other expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was 23 million primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies other income for the year ended december 31 2011 was 81 million which was primarily due to a currency remeasurement gain on an intercompany note

during 2012 our effective income tax rate was 296 versus 294 in 2011 this increase was due to a decrease in rd credits 

at december 31 2012 the functional currencies of our canadian and most of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2011 the net result of these changes led to a pretax increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 245 million in the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 127 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2012 operating profit decreased by 13 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2013 in thousands

 

 

1 we have excluded 269 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm portion of the liability see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2013 we had outstanding surety bonds of 410 million

at december 31 2013 and 2012 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources

we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2014 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding revolving credit borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock

at december 31 2013 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our credit facility contains a 15 billion variablerate revolver with outstanding borrowings of 250 million at december 31 2013 our 400 million senior notes due 2017 800 million senior notes due 2018 500 million senior notes due 2019 and 500 million senior notes due 2022 have fixed interest rates of 1850 2050 3125 and 6250 respectively and our 8 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375 at december 31 2013 the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 15 higher and 16 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments

at december 31 2013 our outstanding variablerate borrowings were 250 million of outstanding revolver borrowings an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 25 million

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish krone sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 24 of our total sales in 2013 and 61 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar was stronger against most of our nonus subsidiary currencies throughout most of 2013 as compared to 2012 which resulted in a decrease in sales of less than 10 due to foreign currency exchange if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2013 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 21

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar at december 31 2013 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2012 resulted in a pretax decrease in net assets of 179 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 95 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

 item 1a   risk factors 

risks relating to our business

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility

as of december 31 2012 we had 202 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 14 billion undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments under our credit facility not to exceed 350 million in aggregate our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish krone sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented 25 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 27 for the year ended december 31 2011 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for 15 of our net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business

as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 27 of our net sales and 22 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers liability insurance our insurance costs increased in prior periods and may increase in the future we believe we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results

 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices to stay competitive

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly a downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business

our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2012 goodwill totaled 387 billion compared to 369 billion of stockholders equity and represented 55 of our total assets of 707 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge if interest rates rise or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating earnings any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report

overview

we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls medical and scientific imaging products and software industrial technology products and rf products services and application software we market these products and services to a broad range of markets including rf applications medical water energy research education softwareasaservice saasbased information networks security and other niche markets

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms

on august 22 2012 we acquired 100 of the shares of sunquest information systems inc sunquest a leading provider of diagnostic and laboratory software solutions to healthcare providers in a 1416 billion allcash transaction we acquired sunquest in order to complement and expand our medical platform

application of critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percentageofcompletion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2012 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 125 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 35 million for a total of 160 million or 30 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2012 was 54 million higher than at december 31 2011 the allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business the writeoff of uncollectible receivables and the addition of reserve balances at acquired businesses

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2012 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 420 million or 180 of gross inventory cost as compared to 352 million or 147 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2011 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized revenue of 1455 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects we recognized 1515 million and 1310 million of revenue using this method during the years ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively at december 31 2012 1904 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2012 our effective income tax rate was 296 which was slightly higher than the 2011 rate of 294 due primarily to a decrease in research and development rd deductions

on january 2 2013 subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2012 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 atra was enacted which retroactively reinstated and extended certain tax provisions including the federal research and development tax credit from january 1 2012 to december 31 2013 as a result the company expects its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit which is estimated to be approximately 3 million the atra also reinstated and extended the exclusion from us federal taxable income of certain interest dividends rents and royalty income of foreign affiliates as well as the tax benefits of the credits associated with that income this provision is retroactively reinstated to january 1 2012 and as a result the company expects its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit which is estimated to be approximately 3 million

 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value using a twostep process the first step of the process utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed in order to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized

key assumptions used in the income and market methodologies are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weightedaverage cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the anticipated future cash flows discount rates and the earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future noncash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances

total goodwill includes 27 reporting units with individual amounts ranging from zero to 992 million we concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value with no impairment indicated as of december 31 2012 however negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business actual results significantly below projections unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units

business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives trade names are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life and are not amortized but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value we conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units using the relieffromroyalty method which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuations specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets this methodology assumes that in lieu of ownership a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted rate of capital each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the reporting unit to which it relates and observed market royalty rates sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions recent sales trends discussions with customers planned timing of new product launches or other variables reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for improved future sales growth

the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the reporting units changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2012 however the fair value of the trade names of one of our reporting units in the rf technology segment could have fallen below the carrying value at december 31 2012 had the assumed sales growth been less than that used in the assessment the reporting unit is a relatively recent acquisition therefore we do not believe that impairment is probable however it is possible that the trade name could become impaired in the future at which point we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying level of the trade names at the reporting unit

we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011

net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 were 299 billion as compared to sales of 280 billion for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 7 the increase was the result of organic sales growth of 4 contributions from acquisitions of 4 and an unfavorable effect from foreign exchange of 1

our medical and scientific imaging segment reported a 932 million or 15 increase in net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 over the year ended december 31 2011 acquisitions added 943 million in sales while organic sales increased 1 due to increased sales in our medical and electron microscopy businesses offset by declines in sales of scientific imaging products the impact from foreign exchange was a negative 1 gross margins increased to 644 in the year ended december 31 2012 from 633 in the year ended december 31 2011 due primarily to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin selling general and administrative expenses sga as a percentage of net sales decreased to 378 in the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 390 in the year ended december 31 2011 due to investments in new products in the medical businesses in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 operating margins were 266 in the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 243 in the year ended december 31 2011

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 579 million or 8 for the year ended december 31 2012 over the year ended december 31 2011 the increase was due to broadbased growth in nearly all businesses in the segment with particular strength in our materials testing business and fluid handling businesses offset in part by a negative 2 impact from foreign exchange gross margins were 516 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 498 in the year ended december 31 2011 due to operating leverage on higher sales volume as well as a 55 million onetime reduction to cost of goods sold at one of our businesses this reduction is due to the cumulative effect of an accounting system error which caused the cost of goods sold to be overstated for several years by quarterly and annually immaterial amounts sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 208 as compared to 215 in the prior year due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume the resulting operating profit margins were 308 in the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 282 in the year ended december 31 2011

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased by 30 million over the year ended december 31 2011 organic sales were flat as growth in toll and traffic systems was offset by a large installation project in gas network monitoring during 2011 that has since been completed gross margins were 524 in 2012 as compared to 506 in the prior year due to product mix sga as a percentage of sales in the year ended december 31 2012 was 261 a decrease from 268 in the prior year due to lower spending particularly in selling expense related to toll projects operating profit margins were 263 in 2012 as compared to 238 in 2011

corporate expenses increased by 206 million to 775 million or 26 of sales in 2012 as compared to 569 million or 20 of sales in 2011 the increase was due to 65 million of acquisition expense related to the sunquest acquisition higher equity compensation as a result of higher stock prices and other compensation related costs

interest expense increased 39 million or 61 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the increase is due primarily to higher average debt balances offset in part by lower average interest rates throughout 2012

other expense for the year ended december 31 2012 was 23 million primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies other income for the year ended december 31 2011 was 81 million which was primarily due to a currency remeasurement gain on an intercompany note

during 2012 our effective income tax rate was 296 versus 294 in 2011 this increase was due to a decrease in rd deductions 

at december 31 2012 the functional currencies of our canadian and most of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2011 the net result of these changes led to a pretax increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 245 million in the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 127 million of this amount related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2012 operating profit decreased by 13 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies

the following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 dollar amounts in thousands  

 

the increase in orders was due to internal growth of 2 as well as orders from acquisitions which added 124 million our industrial technology energy systems and controls and rf technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2012 our medical and scientific imaging segment experienced negative internal growth offset by bookings from recent acquisitions

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from longterm to shortterm debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon our common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date

the company includes in its diluted weightedaverage common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between our average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 3180 plus accretion this is calculated using the treasury stock method

 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2012 in thousands

 

 

1 we have excluded 249 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the longterm portion of the liability see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

2 we have excluded interest on the senior notes due 2013 as they have been effectively converted to variablerate debt due to interest rate swaps see description of certain indebtedness above

at december 31 2012 we had outstanding surety bonds of 402 million

at december 31 2012 and 2011 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2013 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock

at december 31 2012 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our credit facility contains a 15 billion variablerate revolver with outstanding borrowings of 100 million at december 31 2012 our 400 million senior notes due 2017 500 million senior notes due 2019 and 500 million senior notes due 2022 have fixed interest rates of 1850 3125 and 6250 respectively and our 12 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375 our 500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6625 however in october 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling 500 million that expire august 2013 the swaps which are designated as fair value hedges effectively convert the notes to a weightedaverage variablerate obligation with a spread of 4377 plus libor at december 31 2012 the prevailing market rates for our longterm notes were between 03 higher and 45 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments

at december 31 2012 our outstanding variablerate borrowings were the 100 million of outstanding revolver borrowings and the 500 million senior notes due 2013 an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 60 million

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish krone sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 25 of our total sales in 2012 and 60 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar was stronger against most currencies throughout most of 2012 as compared to 2011 which resulted in a decrease in sales of 10 due to foreign currency exchange if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2012 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 25

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar at december 31 2012 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2011 resulted in a pretax increase in net assets of 236 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 127 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

materials and suppliers 

we believe that most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a result could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and related claims we are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

customers 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales for 2011 for any segment or for roper as a whole 

competition 

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2011 we had 109 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 707 million undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments under our credit facility not to exceed 350 million in aggregate our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds and danish krone sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented approximately 27 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 25 for the year ended december 31 2010 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for 15 of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 29 of our net sales and 21 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability 

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to product liability risks in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance our insurance costs increased in prior periods and may continue to increase in the future we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

  

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business 

our goodwill and intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2011 goodwill totaled 287 billion compared to 320 billion of stockholders’ equity and represented 54 of our total assets of 532 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and indefinite economic life intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating earnings any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 

overview 

we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls medical and scientific imaging products and software industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including rf applications medical water energy research education softwareasaservice saasbased information networks security and other niche markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms on june 3 2011 we purchased the assets of ndi holding corp “northern digital”   a provider of 3d measurement technology for medical applications in computerassisted surgery and computerassisted therapy on september 26 2011 we purchased the shares of united controls group inc “ucg” a manufacturer of control systems in the oil and gas industry on december 1 2011 we purchased the shares of trinity integrated systems ltd “trinity” a specialist provider of requirements capture safety lifecycle management and engineering software tools and safety and control system solutions to the oil and gas industrial process and control markets 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percentageofcompletion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2011 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 82 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 24 million for a total of 106 million or 24 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2011 was 03 million higher than at december 31 2010 the allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business as well as the writeoff of uncollectible receivables 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2011 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 352 million or 147 of gross inventory cost as compared to 325 million or 154 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2010 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory 

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized revenue of approximately 1515 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects approximately 1310 million and 1425 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively at december 31 2011 1321 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the us combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2011 our effective income tax rate was 294 which was higher than the 2010 rate of 281 due primarily to a foreign tax credit received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value using a twostep process the first step of the process utilizes both an income approach discounted cash flows and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed in order to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill an impairment loss would be recognized 

key assumptions used in the income and market methodologies are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results strategic plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows the weighted average cost of capital comparable transactions market data and earnings multiples the assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the anticipated future cash flows discount rates and the earnings multiples while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances 

total goodwill includes 26 reporting units with individual amounts ranging from zero to 536 million we concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of december 31 2011 and thus no goodwill impairment was identified 

 

identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment annually using a onestep fair value based approach roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangibles during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is below its carrying value no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2011 

 

roper evaluates whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives or of the remaining life of such assets when certain indicators of impairment are present in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability would be performed if an evaluation is required the estimated future gross undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a writedown to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required

net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 were 278 billion as compared to sales of 239 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 an increase of 172 the increase was the result of organic sales growth of 127 favorable effect from foreign exchange of 14 and 31 from acquisitions 

our medical and scientific imaging segment reported a 619 million or 113 increase in net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 over the year ended december 31 2010 acquisitions added 261 million in sales while organic sales increased 51 due to increased sales in our electron microscopy and medical businesses the impact from foreign exchange was a positive 14 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by 939 million or 186 over the year ended december 31 2010 organic sales increased 159 while acquisitions added 4 million or 08 the increase in organic sales was primarily due to increased demand in industrial process end markets and growth in our diesel engine safety systems the impact from foreign exchange was a positive 20 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 1298 million or 214 for the year ended december 31 2011 over the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was due to broadbased growth in all businesses in the segment with particular strength in our materials testing business and fluid handling businesses as well as a positive 18 impact from foreign exchange 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by 1254 million or 173 over the year ended december 31 2010 organic sales increased 103 due to strength in sales to colleges and universities growth in our water and gas network monitoring products and growth in our toll and traffic solutions foreign exchange added 07 to revenue and acquisitions added 63 

our overall gross profit percentage was 542 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 534 for the year ended december 31 2010 our energy systems and controls and rf technology segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure our medical and scientific imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin our industrial technology segment gross margins decreased slightly due to product mix 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 942 million to 8550 million in 2011 as compared to 7608 million in 2010 while decreasing as a percentage of net sales to 306 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 319 for the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease in percentage of net sales is due to operating leverage on higher sales volume offset in part by increased research and development spending of 19 million as we continued to invest in new product development 

interest expense decreased 29 million or 43 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease is due primarily to lower average debt balances and higher interest income throughout 2011 

other income for the year ended december 31 2011 was 81 million which was primarily due to a currency remeasurement gain on an intercompany note other income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 06 million primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies 

during 2011 our effective income tax rate was 294 versus 281 in 2010 this increase was due primarily to a foreign tax credit received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011 

at december 31 2011 the functional currencies of our canadian and most of our european subsidiaries were weaker against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2010 the net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 110 million in the year ending december 31 2011 approximately 51 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2011 operating profit increased by 14 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 dollar amounts in thousands 

 

 

the increase in orders was due to internal growth of 83 as well as orders from acquisitions which added 78 million our industrial technology energy systems and controls and rf technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2011 our medical and scientific imaging segment experienced moderate internal growth 

the following table summarizes order backlog information at december 31 2011 and 2010 dollar amounts in thousands our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

  

 

 

 

 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 239 billion as compared to sales of 205 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 an increase of 164 the increase was the result of internal sales growth of 78 as well as a full year of sales from our 2009 acquisitions of uts and verathon and five months of sales from itrade net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 179 million of additional sales in 2010 over 2009 

our medical and scientific imaging segment reported a 1939 million or 547 increase in net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 over the year ended december 31 2009 acquisitions added 1479 million in sales while organic sales increased 125 due to broadbased increases in medical imaging and handheld computer markets the impact from foreign exchange was a positive 10 resulting in internal growth of 135 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 increased by 630 million or 143 over the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in sales was due to broadbased recovery in the markets served by the segment which led to increased demand for our instruments valves and sensors sold into these markets 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 713 million or 133 for the year ended december 31 2010 over the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was due to a broad based economic recovery in the industrial end markets strong sales growth in our neptune water meter business and increased sales in our materials testing businesses as customer manufacturing facilities which had experienced slowdowns or temporary shutdowns in 2009 came back on line or increased production 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 increased by 82 million or 11 over the year ended december 31 2009 internal sales decreased 32 due to delays in transportation projects due to temporary reductions in state and local governmental funding partial year results from the acquisition of itrade and fullyear results of uts added 43 

in 2009 in order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results we committed to certain severance and related costcontrol actions the cost of these actions during the year ended december 31 2009 totaled 124 million 41 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining 83 million as sga expense we had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010 or 2011 

our overall gross profit percentage was 534 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 509 for the year ended december 31 2009 our industrial technology and energy systems and controls segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure our medical and scientific imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin our rf technology segment gross margins were relatively unchanged 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1131 million to 7608 million in 2010 as compared to 6477 million in 2009 while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 319 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 316 for the year ended december 31 2009 the full year inclusion of verathon accounted for 72 million of the increase in addition our research and development spending increased 19 million as we continued to invest in new product development 

interest expense increased 80 million or 136 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase is due primarily to higher interest rates in the current year which accounted for approximately 5 million of the increase and a higher average debt balance throughout 2010 

other income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 06 million which was primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses other income for the year ended december 31 2009 was 35 million primarily due to a pretax gain of 41 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business partially offset by a 04 million pretax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies 

during 2010 our effective income tax rate was 281 versus 295 in 2009 this decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the section 199 qualifying production activities deduction 

at december 31 2010 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were weaker and the canadian dollar stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2009 the net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 198 million in the year ending december 31 2010 approximately 155 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2010 operating profit decreased by less than 05 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 dollar amounts in thousands 

 

 

the increase in orders was due to internal growth of 158 as well as orders from acquisitions which added 195 million our industrial technology and energy systems and controls segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2010 as did our medical and scientific imaging segment which also experienced an increase of 159 million due to 2009 acquisitions in our rf technology segment internal orders decreased by 11 which was more than offset by acquisition growth 

the following table summarizes order backlog information at december 31 2010 and 2009 dollar amounts in thousands our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

  

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 are as follows in millions 

 

operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and increased intangible amortization related to recent acquisitions offset partially by higher inventory levels and lower accounts payable balances at year end 

investing activities  cash used by investing activities during 2011 2010 and 2009 was primarily for business acquisitions 

financing activities  cash used by financing activities in all periods was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders cash provided by financing activities during 2010 and 2009 was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations and in 2009 also included 121 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 2931 million at december 31 2011 compared to 2814 million at december 31 2010 we acquired net working capital of 52 million through business acquisitions during 2011 

total debt was 11 billion at december 31 2011 254 of total capital compared to 13 billion at december 31 2010 328 of total capital our decreased debt at december 31 2011 compared to december 31 2010 was due to debt payments made using cash from operations 

our senior unsecured credit facility originally consisted of a two year 350 million term loan and a five year 750 million revolving loan however the term loan portion was repaid in september 2009 and cannot be reborrowed at december 31 2011 our debt consisted of 672 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due 2034 500 million of senior notes due 2013 and 500 million of senior notes due 2019 in addition we had 61 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our nonus businesses we had 496 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2011 of which 435 million was covered by our lending group thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately 

the cash and shortterm investments at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2011 totaled 164 million repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes we consider this cash to be permanently reinvested we expect that cash flows from existing business combined with our available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the us 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 2011 

capital expenditures of 407 million 286 million and 259 million were incurred during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in the future we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 10 and 15 of annual net sales 

  description of certain indebtedness 

senior unsecured credit facility  on july 7 2008 we entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders the credit facility is composed of a five year 750 million revolving credit facility maturing july 7 2013 and as originally issued a 350 million term loan facility originally maturing july 7 2010 the 350 million term loan was repaid early in september 2009 we may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 350 million 

the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt prepay subordinated debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 35 

senior notes due 2019  in september 2009 we completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 625 senior unsecured notes due september 2019 net proceeds of 496 million were used to pay off our 350 million term loan originally due july 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our credit facility we recorded a 04 million noncash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility 

the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 625 per year payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning march 1 2010 

we may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities 

the notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 

senior notes due 2013  on august 6 2008 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes due august 15 2013 these notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6625 per year payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year beginning february 15 2009 the interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes 

the notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 

during 2009 we entered into an aggregate notional amount of 500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which effectively changed our 500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6625 to a variable rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4377 plus the three month london interbank offered rate “libor” due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of an 117 million fair value adjustment at december 31 2011 and 141 million at december 31 2010 

senior subordinated convertible notes  in december 2003 we issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes was payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after which cash interest is not paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable as of january 15 2009 interest is recognized at the effective rate of 375 and represents accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 in accordance with this criterion contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since january 15 2009 

the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 

as originally issued each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12422 shares of our common stock giving effect to the 2for1 stock split effective august 26 2005 and subject to further adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we would have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock on november 19 2004 we began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that we would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes but would change how the conversion value is paid in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and at our option any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december 6 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon our common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005 

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date 

the company includes in its diluted weightedaverage common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between our average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 3180 plus accretion this is calculated using the treasury stock method 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2011 in thousands 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2011 we had outstanding surety bonds of 313 million 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2012 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2011 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our credit facility contains a 750 million variable rate revolver however there were no outstanding revolver borrowings at december 31 2011 our 500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 625 and our 67 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375 our 500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6625 however in october 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling 500 million that expire august 2013 the swaps which are designated as fair value hedges effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4377 plus libor at december 31 2011 the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 25 and 51 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments 

at december 31 2011 our outstanding variablerate borrowing was the 500 million senior notes due 2013 an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 50 million 

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish krone sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 27 of our total sales and 63 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar was weaker against most currencies throughout most of 2011 as compared to 2010 which resulted in an increase in sales of 14 due to foreign currency exchange if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2011 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 27 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar at december 31 2011 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2010 resulted in a decrease in net assets of 110 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 51 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

distribution and sales  distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel manufacturers’ representatives and distributors 

materials and suppliers 

we believe that most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors thus far supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and related claims we are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

customers 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales for 2010 for any segment or for roper as a whole 

competition 

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

patents and trademarks 

in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own or license the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees to protect our trade secrets and knowhow we believe that our operating units are not substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2010 we had 134 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 468 million undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments not to exceed 350 million in aggregate our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance or which is assumed in connection with acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds and danish krone sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented approximately 25 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 23 for the year ended december 31 2009 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings at present we do not hedge against foreign currency risks 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for approximately 15 of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 26 of our net sales and 18 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate terms obtain financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets once acquired operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability 

acquisitions involve risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance our insurance costs increased in prior periods and may continue to increase in the future we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and energy markets accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business 

our intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2010 goodwill totaled 273 billion compared to 275 billion of stockholders’ equity which was 54 of our total assets of 507 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations decline we could incur a noncash charge to operating earnings any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial internal investment there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

many of our products rely on proprietary technology therefore we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions to deteriorate or cause demand for our products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 

overview 

we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls medical and scientific imaging products and software industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including rf applications medical water energy research education food and food services security and other niche markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments on february 22 2010 we purchased the assets of heartscape inc including a technology with the capability to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting heart attacks on july 27 2010 we purchased itradenetwork inc “itrade” a global provider of softwareas–aservice “saas” based trading network and business intelligence solutions primarily to the perishable food market 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2010 included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percentageofcompletion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2010 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 79 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 24 million for a total of 103 million or 26 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2010 was 08 million lower than at december 31 2009 the allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business as well as the write off of uncollectible receivables 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage at december 31 2010 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 325 million or 154 of gross inventory cost as compared to 290 million or 140 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2009 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory 

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized revenue of approximately 1310 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects approximately 1425 million and 1279 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively at december 31 2010 approximately 1577 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2010 our effective income tax rate was 281 which was lower than the 2009 rate of 295 due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the section 199 qualifying production activities deduction 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment using a twostep method on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value total goodwill includes 25 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately 536 million identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment on an annual basis using a onestep fair value based approach we conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2010 

  

  

 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales 

  

 

 

 

 

 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were 239 billion as compared to sales of 205 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 an increase of 164 the increase was the result of internal sales growth of 78 as well as a full year of sales from our 2009 acquisitions of uts and verathon and five months of sales from itrade net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 179 million of additional sales in 2010 over 2009 

our medical and scientific imaging segment reported a 1939 million or 547 increase in net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 over the year ended december 31 2009 acquisitions added 1479 million in sales while organic sales increased 125 due to broadbased increases in medical imaging and handheld computer markets the impact from foreign exchange was a positive 10 resulting in internal growth of 135 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 increased by 630 million or 143 over the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in sales was due to broadbased recovery in the markets served by the segment which led to increased demand for our instruments valves and sensors sold into these markets 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 713 million or 133 for the year ended december 31 2010 over the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was due to a broad based economic recovery in the industrial end markets strong sales growth in our neptune water meter business and increased sales in our materials testing businesses as customer manufacturing facilities which had experienced slowdowns or temporary shutdowns in 2009 came back on line or increased production 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 increased by 82 million or 11 over the year ended december 31 2009 internal sales decreased 32 due to delays in transportation projects due to temporary reductions in state and local governmental funding partial year results from the acquisition of itrade and fullyear results of uts added 43 

in 2009 in order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results we committed to certain severance and related costcontrol actions the cost of these actions during the year ended december 31 2009 totaled 124 million 41 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining 83 million as selling general and administrative “sga” expense as of december 31 2010 120 million in cash payments had been made with the remaining 04 million reported as accrued liabilities which are expected to be paid in 2011 we had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010 

our overall gross profit percentage was 534 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 509 for the year ended december 31 2009 our industrial technology and energy systems and controls segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure medical and scientific imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin our rf technology segment gross margins were relatively unchanged 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1131 million to 7608 million in 2010 as compared to 6477 million in 2009 while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 319 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 316 for the year ended december 31 2009 the full year inclusion of verathon accounted for 72 million of the increase in addition our research and development spending increased 19 million as we continued to invest in new product development 

interest expense increased 80 million or 136 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase is due primarily to higher interest rates in the current year which accounted for approximately 5 million of the increase and a higher average debt balance throughout 2010 

other income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 06 million which was primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses other income for the year ended december 31 2009 was 35 million primarily due to a pretax gain of 41 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business partially offset by a 04 million pretax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies 

during 2010 our effective income tax rate was 281 versus 295 in 2009 this decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the section 199 qualifying production activities deduction 

at december 31 2010 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were weaker and the canadian dollar stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2009 the net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 198 million in the year ending december 31 2010 approximately 155 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2010 operating profit decreased by less than 05 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 dollar amounts in thousands 

 

the increase in orders was due to internal growth of 158 as well as orders from acquisitions which added 195 million our industrial technology and energy systems and controls segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2010 as did our medical and scientific imaging segment which also experienced an increase of 159 million due to 2009 acquisitions in our rf technology segment internal orders decreased by 11 which was more than offset by acquisition growth 

the following table summarizes order backlog information at december 31 2010 and 2009 dollar amounts in thousands our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

  

 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 were 205 billion as compared to sales of 231 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 a decrease of 111 this decrease was the result of the worldwide economic slump experienced throughout 2009 our 2009 results included a full year of sales from our 2008 acquisitions of cbord techpro chalwyn getloaded horizon and technolog these results also included two months from uts and one month from verathon net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 79 million of additional sales in 2009 over 2008 that was offset by a decrease in sales of our other business of 335 million or 15 which includes negative organic growth of 14 and a 1 negative foreign exchange impact 

in order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results we committed to certain severance and related costcontrol actions during the year ended december 31 2009 the cost of these actions totaled 124 million 41 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining 83 million as selling general and administrative “sga” expense as of december 31 2010 120 million in cash payments had been made with the remaining 04 million reported as accrued liabilities which are expected to be paid in 2011 we had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010 the impact of these costs on our business segment results is included below 

our medical and scientific imaging segment reported a 208 million or 55 decrease in net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 over the year ended december 31 2008 organic sales decreased 73 due to lower shipments to research and imaging markets and the impact from foreign exchange was negative 16 these declines were slightly offset by one month of sales from verathon 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased by 1073 million or 196 over the year ended december 31 2008 we experienced negative internal growth of approximately 1085 million or 199 which includes a 22 negative foreign exchange impact the decrease in sales was due to broadbased weakness in the markets serviced by the segment which led to reduced demand for our instruments valves and sensors sold into these markets 

net sales for our industrial technology segment decreased by 1514 million or 220 for the year ended december 31 2009 over the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was due to a generally weak economy fewer projects for automatic meter reading deployment at neptune and the slowdown or temporary shutdowns of many customer manufacturing facilities which impacted our materials testing business 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by 228 million or 33 over the year ended december 31 2008 internal sales decreased 62 due to weakness in security markets and lower hardware and tag sales related to transportation projects partial year results from the acquisition of uts and fullyear results of 2008 acquisitions added 93 

our overall gross profit percentage was 509 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 515 for the year ended december 31 2008 the 41 million in restructuring charges included in cost of goods sold represented 02 as a percentage of net sales in 2009 as our restructuring and other cost containment actions at the business unit level nearly offset the negative operating leverage on decreased sales our industrial technology and energy systems and controls segments both experienced lower gross margins due to the decline in sales as a result of weakness in their end markets medical and scientific imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to favorable product mix lower costs and favorable leverage due to a record fourth quarter sales performance our rf technology segment gross margins were negatively impacted by an unfavorable product mix due to higher service revenue and lower hardware shipments in transportation end markets 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 544 million to 6477 million in 2009 as compared to 7021 million in 2008 while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 316 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 304 for the year ended december 31 2008 the change is primarily due to negative operating leverage on lower sales included in the 2009 expense were restructuring costs of 83 million 

interest expense decreased 23 million or 37 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the inclusion in 2008 of amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes which ceased on january 15 2009 

other income for the year ended december 31 2009 was 29 million which was primarily due to a pretax gain of 41 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business partially offset by a 04 million pretax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies other income for the year ended december 31 2008 was 35 million primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our nonus based companies offset by a 31 million pretax debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility 

during 2009 our effective income tax rate was 295 versus 343 in 2008 this decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives our decision to permanently reinvest prior earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions the release of reserves related to uncertain tax provisions and an approximately 18 million discrete benefit related to the resolution of a tax item in a foreign jurisdiction 

at december 31 2009 the functional currencies of our european and canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2008 the net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 424 million in the year ending december 31 2009 approximately 282 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2009 operating profit decreased by approximately 1 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 dollar amounts in thousands 

 

the decrease in orders is due to overwhelming weaknesses in world markets however order backlog as of december 31 2009 only decreased by 41 as compared to december 31 2008 this was due primarily to a fourth quarter order increase in our medical and scientific imaging and rf technology segments 

the following table summarizes order backlog information at december 31 2009 and 2008 dollar amounts in thousands our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

  

 

  

  

 

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are as follows in millions 

 

operating activities  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year increased compensationrelated accruals related to higher income levels in 2010 and increased intangible amortization related to recent acquisitions 

investing activities  cash used by investing activities during 2010 2009 and 2008 were primarily business acquisitions 

financing activities  cash provided by financing activities during each of these years was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations and in 2009 also included 121 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs cash used by financing activities in all periods was primarily debt repayments 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 2814 million at december 31 2010 compared to 3378 million at december 31 2009 we acquired negative net working capital of 59 million through business acquisitions during 2010 

total debt was 13 billion at december 31 2010 328 of total capital compared to 12 billion at december 31 2009 323 of total capital our increased debt at december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 was due to borrowings for 2010 acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations 

our senior unsecured credit facility originally consisted of a two year 350 million term loan and a five year 750 million revolving loan however the term loan portion was repaid in september 2009 and cannot be reborrowed the weighted average interest rate on the revolver borrowings under the facility at december 31 2010 was 156 at december 31 2010 our debt consisted of 91 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 500 million of senior notes due 2013 500 million of senior notes due 2019 and 230 million outstanding under the revolving loan in addition we had 60 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our nonus businesses the company had 553 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2010 of which 519 million were covered by our lending group thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately we expect that our available borrowing capacity combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 2010 

capital expenditures of 286 million 259 million and 300 million were incurred during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in the future we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 10 and 15 of annual net sales 

 

  description of certain indebtedness 

senior unsecured credit facility  on july 7 2008 the company entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders the credit facility is composed of a five year 750 million revolving credit facility maturing july 7 2013 and as originally issued a 350 million term loan facility originally maturing july 7 2010 the 350 million term loan was repaid early in september 2009 the company may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 350 million 

the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt prepay subordinated debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 35 

senior notes due 2019  in september 2009 we completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 625 senior unsecured notes due september 2019 net proceeds of 496 million were used to pay off our 350 million term loan originally due july 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our credit facility we recorded a 04 million noncash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility 

the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 625 per year payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning march 1 2010 

we may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities 

the notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 

senior notes due 2013  on august 6 2008 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes due august 15 2013 these notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6625 per year payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year beginning february 15 2009 the interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes 

the notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of the company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of the company’s subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries 

during 2009 we entered into an aggregate notional amount of 500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges  which effectively changed our 500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6625 to a variable rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4377 plus the three month london interbank offered rate “libor” due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of a 141 million fair value adjustment at december 31 2010 and 32 million at december 31 2009 

senior subordinated convertible notes  in december 2003 we issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes was payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after which cash interest will not be paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable since january 15 2009 interest is recognized at the effective rate of 375 and represents accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 in accordance with this criterion contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since january 15 2009 

the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 

as originally issued each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12422 shares of our common stock giving effect to the 2for1 stock split effective august 26 2005 and subject to further adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we would have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock on november 19 2004 the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes but would change how the conversion value is paid in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and at the company’s option any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december 6 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon the company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005 

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date 

the company includes in its diluted weightedaverage common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 3180 plus accretion this is calculated using the treasury stock method 

 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2010 in thousands 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2010 we had outstanding surety bonds of 317 million 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2011 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2010 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our credit facility contains a 750 million variable rate revolver at december 31 2010 the weighted average interest rate was 156 on the outstanding revolver balance of 230 million our 500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 625 and our 91 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375 our 500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6625 however in october 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling 500 million that expire august 2013 the swaps which are designated as fair value hedges effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4377 plus libor at december 31 2010 the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 15 and 41 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments 

at december 31 2010 our outstanding variablerate borrowings were 230 million in revolver borrowings and the 500 million senior notes due 2013 an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 73 million 

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish krone sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 25 of our total sales and 64 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar strengthened against most currencies and weakened against the canadian dollar throughout 2010 which resulted in an increase in sales of less than 1 due to foreign currency exchange if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2010 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 32 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during 2010 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2009 resulted in a decrease in net assets of 198 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 155 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

distribution and sales  distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel manufacturers’ representatives and distributors 

materials and suppliers 

we believe that most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors thus far supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we are required continually to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

customers 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of net sales for 2009 for any segment or for roper as a whole 

competition 

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2009 we had 115 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had 661 million undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments not to exceed 350 million in aggregate our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to certain restrictions contained in our credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance or which is assumed in connection with acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our facility could result in an event of default under this facility which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds and danish krone sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented approximately 23 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 24 for the year ended december 31 2008 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings at present we do not hedge against foreign currency risks 

 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for approximately 15 and 16 of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 respectively we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could have a material negative effect on our future sales and earnings 

the effects of the recent global financial crisis and general weakness in the global economy may impact our business 

 

the recent global financial crisis and general weakness in the global economy have resulted in a general tightening in the credit markets lower levels of liquidity and corresponding increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and extreme volatility in credit equity and fixed income markets these macroeconomic developments have had adverse effects on our customers and could have adverse effects on our business including decreased revenue from the sales of products and increased financing costs due to the failure of financial institutions the combination of some or all of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 23 of our net sales and 19 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets once integrated acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance our insurance costs increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 

changes in the supply of or price for raw materials parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

the availability and prices of raw materials parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components as well as any increases in commodity prices particularly copper could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial energy and semiconductor markets accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business 

our intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2009 goodwill totaled 239 billion compared to 242 billion of stockholders’ equity which was 55 of our total assets of 433 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions in the us and abroad to deteriorate or cause worldwide demand for us products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the us or in other areas of the world could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 

overview 

we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging products and software industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including rf applications medical water energy research education security and other niche markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments on october 30 2009 we purchased the assets of united toll systems llc “uts” which provides software and inlane hardware systems for toll and traffic markets on december 3 2009 we purchased verathon inc “verathon” a leading global provider of proprietary medical devices and services 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percent of completion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2009 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 94 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 18 million for a total of 112 million or 28 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2009 is 15 million lower than at december 31 2008 and is unchanged as a percent of sales 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances at december 31 2009 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 290 million or 140 of gross inventory cost as compared to 301 million or 139 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2008 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory 

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized revenue of approximately 1425 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects approximately 1279 million and 1355 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively at december 31 2009 approximately 1481 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2009 our effective income tax rate was 295 which was lower than the 2008 rate of 343 due to certain foreign tax planning initiatives our decision to permanently reinvest prior earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions the release of reserves related to uncertain tax provisions and an approximately 18 million discrete benefit related to the resolution of a tax item in a foreign jurisdiction 

we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives goodwill which is not amortized is tested for impairment using a twostep method on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value total goodwill includes 24 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately 535 million identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized but separately tested for impairment using a onestep fair value based approach we conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2009 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales 

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

 

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 were 205 billion as compared to sales of 231 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 a decrease of 111 this decrease was the result of the worldwide economic slump experienced throughout 2009 our 2009 results included a full year of sales from our 2008 acquisitions of cbord techpro chalwyn getloaded horizon and technolog these results also included two months from uts and one month from verathon net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 79 million of additional sales in 2009 over 2008 that was offset by a decrease in sales of our other business of 335 million or 15 which includes negative organic growth of 14 and a 1 negative foreign exchange impact 

in order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results we committed to certain severance and related costcontrol actions during the year ended december 31 2009 the cost of these actions totaled 124 million 41 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining 83 million as selling general and administrative “sga” expense as of december 31 2009 111 million in cash payments have been made with the remaining 13 million reported as accrued liabilities which are expected to be paid in 2010 we do not expect additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010 although contingency plans are in place should the economy worsen the impact of these costs on our business segment results is included below 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported a 208 million or 55 decrease in net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 over the year ended december 31 2008 organic sales decreased 73 due to lower shipments to research and imaging markets and the impact from foreign exchange was negative 16 these declines were slightly offset by one month of sales from verathon 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased by 1073 million or 196 over the year ended december 31 2008 we experienced negative internal growth of approximately 1085 million or 199 which includes a 22 negative foreign exchange impact the decrease in sales was due to broadbased weakness in the markets serviced by the segment which led to reduced demand for our instruments valves and sensors sold into these markets 

net sales for our industrial technology segment decreased by 1514 million or 220 for the year ended december 31 2009 over the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was due to a generally weak economy fewer projects for automatic meter reading deployment at neptune and the slowdown or temporary shutdowns of many customer manufacturing facilities which impacted our materials testing business 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 increased by 228 million or 33 over the year ended december 31 2008 internal sales decreased 62 due to weakness in security markets and lower hardware and tag sales related to transportation projects partial year results from the acquisition of uts and fullyear results of 2008 acquisitions added 93 

our overall gross profit percentage was 509 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 515 for the year ended december 31 2008 the 41 million in restructuring charges included in cost of goods sold represented 02 as a percentage of net sales in 2009 as our restructuring and other cost containment actions at the business unit level nearly offset the negative operating leverage on decreased sales our industrial technology and energy systems and controls segments both experienced lower gross margins due to the decline in sales as a result of weakness in their end markets scientific and industrial imaging segments gross margins increased primarily due to favorable product mix lower costs and favorable leverage due to a record fourth quarter sales performance our rf technology segment gross margins were negatively impacted by an unfavorable product mix due to higher service revenue and lower hardware shipments in transportation end markets 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 544 million to 6477 million in 2009 as compared to 7021 million in 2008 while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 316 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 304 for the year ended december 31 2008 the change is primarily due to negative operating leverage on lower sales included in the 2009 expense were restructuring costs of 83 million 

interest expense decreased 23 million or 37 for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the inclusion in 2008 of amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes which ceased on january 15 2009 

other income for the year ended december 31 2009 was 29 million which was primarily due to a pretax gain of 41 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business partially offset by a 04 million pretax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies other income for the year ended december 31 2008 was 35 million primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our nonus based companies offset by a 31 million pretax debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility 

during 2009 our effective income tax rate was 295 versus 343 in 2008 this decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives our decision to permanently reinvest prior earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions the release of reserves related to uncertain tax provisions and an approximately 18 million discrete benefit related to the resolution of a tax item in a foreign jurisdiction 

at december 31 2009 the functional currencies of our european and canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2008 the net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 424 million in the year ending december 31 2009 approximately 282 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2009 operating profit decreased by approximately 1 due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 dollar amounts in thousands   

 

the decrease in sales orders is due to overwhelming weaknesses in world markets however sales order backlog as of december 31 2009 only decreased by 41 as compared to december 31 2008 this was due primarily to a fourth quarter order increase in our scientific and industrial imaging and rf technology segments 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2009 and 2008 dollar amounts in thousands our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

  

 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 were 231 billion as compared to sales of 210 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 an increase of 97 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and organic growth our 2008 results included a full year of sales from our 2007 acquisitions of jlt dj instruments roda deaco dynamic instruments and black diamond these results also included ten months of sales from cbord nine months from techpro six months from chalwyn five months from getloaded four months from horizon and three months from technolog net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 133 million of our 2008 net sales increase over 2007 and growth of our other business accounted for 71 million of the increase or 34 which includes a 07 foreign exchange impact 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported a 06 million or 02 decrease in net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 over the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease was attributable to the year over year impact of the removal of the motion camera product line organic growth for 2008 was flat as increased sales in our medical businesses were offset by slowing sales in our industrial camera businesses foreign exchange added 07 to sales 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by 318 million or 62 over the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 18 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2007 acquisitions of dj instruments roda deaco and dynamic instruments as well as partial year results from the 2008 acquisitions of techpro and chalwyn internal growth was approximately 14 million or 28 which includes 07 from foreign exchange internal growth was led by strength in our protective technology and oil and gas pipeline controls businesses 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 432 million or 67 for the year ended december 31 2008 over the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was due to broadbased growth in all businesses in this segment as well as 14 from foreign currency exchange 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by 1300 million or 230 over the year ended december 31 2007 the partial year results from the acquisitions of cbord getloaded horizon and technolog and fullyear results of 2007 acquisitions accounted for approximately 119 million of the increase internal growth increased 19 due to growth in our intelligent traffic systems business offset by anticipated declines in our large middle east project as it transitions from the design and installation phase to operations and maintenance 

our overall gross profit percentage was 515 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 504 for the year ended december 31 2007 due to operating leverage on increased sales our industrial technology energy systems and controls and scientific and industrial imaging segments gross margins were relatively unchanged in 2008 as compared to 2007 our rf technology segment gross margins increased to 508 in 2008 as compared to 468 in 2007 due to the favorable mix within existing businesses and higher gross margins in acquired businesses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased to 304 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 from 295 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase is primarily due to the higher sga structure in our education market businesses within the rf technology segment in addition corporate expenses increased due to higher equity compensation costs and the additional costs to the company due to the increase in roper’s stock price on the grant dates of stock awards 

interest expense increased 20 million or 33 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2008 offset by lower interest rates on our variable debt throughout the year 

the change in other income for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 was primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our nonus based companies as the us dollar strengthened against most currencies in the fourth quarter of 2008 these foreign exchange gains were offset by a 31 million pretax debt restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility 

during 2008 our effective income tax rate was 343 versus 348 in 2007 this decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives 

at december 31 2008 the functional currencies of our european and canadian subsidiaries were weaker against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2007 the net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 867 million in the year ending december 31 2008 approximately 598 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2008 operating profit increased by less than 1 of sales due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 dollar amounts in thousands   

 

the increase in sales orders is due to organic growth of 17 foreign exchange of 07 and the remainder from acquisitions the industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year net orders in the energy systems and controls segment increased due to the 2007 and 2008 acquisitions scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased due to strength in our medical business and camera sales into the security and teleconferencing application markets offset by decreases in industrial cameras sales the rf technology segment experienced strong order growth for projects in the tolling and traffic control businesses 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2008 and 2007 dollar amounts in thousands our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

  

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

selected cash flows for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are as follows in millions 

 

operating activities  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was primarily due to lower earnings over the prior year and decreased liabilities offset partially by improved inventory management and receivables collection 

investing activities  cash used by investing activities during 2009 2008 and 2007 were primarily business acquisitions 

financing activities  cash provided by financing activities during each of these years was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions and in 2009 also included 121 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs cash used by financing activities in all periods was primarily debt repayments 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 3378 million at december 31 2009 compared to 2949 million at december 31 2008 we acquired approximately 458 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2009 

total debt was 12 billion at december 31 2009 323 of total capital compared to 13 billion at december 31 2008 387 of total capital our decreased debt at december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 was due to the use of operating cash flows to repay debt related to 2008 acquisitions as well a decrease in borrowings related to acquisitions in 2009 over the prior year 

our senior unsecured credit facility originally consisted of a two year 350 million term loan and a five year 750 million revolving loan however the term loan portion was repaid in september 2009 and cannot be reborrowed the weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the facility at december 31 2009 was 152 at december 31 2009 our debt consisted of 111 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 500 million of senior notes due 2013 500 million of senior notes due 2019 and 40 million outstanding under the revolving loan in addition we had 64 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our nonus businesses the company had 533 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2009 of which 492 million were covered by our lending group thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately we expect that our available borrowing capacity combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 2009 

capital expenditures of 259 million 300 million and 301 million were incurred during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in the future we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1 and 2 of annual net sales 

  

  

  description of certain indebtedness 

senior unsecured credit facility  on july 7 2008 the company entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders the credit facility is composed of a five year 750 million revolving credit facility maturing july 7 2013 and as originally issued a 350 million term loan facility originally maturing july 7 2010 the 350 million term loan was repaid early in september 2009 the company may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 350 million 

the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt prepay subordinated debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 35 

senior notes due 2019  in september 2009 we completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 625 senior unsecured notes due september 2019 net proceeds of 496 million were used to pay off our 350 million term loan originally due july 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our credit facility we recorded a 04 million noncash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility 

the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 625 per year payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year beginning march 1 2010 

we may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities 

the notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 

senior notes due 2013  on august 6 2008 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes due august 15 2013 these notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6625 per year payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year beginning february 15 2009 the interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes 

the notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of the company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of the company’s subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries 

at december 31 2009 an aggregate notional amount of 500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges effectively changed our 500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6625 to a variable rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4377 plus the three month london interbank offered rate “libor” due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of a 32 million fair value adjustment 

senior subordinated convertible notes  in december 2003 we issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes was payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after that date we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable since january 15 2009 interest is recognized at the effective rate of 375 and represents accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 in accordance with this criterion contingent interest has been accrued for each six month period since january 15 2009 

the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 

as originally issued each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12422 shares of our common stock giving effect to the 2for1 stock split effective august 26 2005 and subject to further adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we would have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock on november 19 2004 the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes but would change how the conversion value is paid in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and at the company’s option any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december 6 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon the company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005 

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date 

the company includes in its diluted weightedaverage common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 3180 plus accretion this is calculated using the treasury stock method 

we separately account for the liability and equity components of our 375 senior subordinated convertible notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2009 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

at december 31 2009 we had outstanding surety bonds of 285 million 

at december 31 2009 and 2008 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2010 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

recently issued accounting standards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2009 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our credit facility contains a 750 million variable rate revolver at december 31 2009 the weighted average interest rate was 152 on the outstanding revolver balance of 40 million our 500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 625 and our 111 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375 our 500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6625 however in october 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling 500 million that expire august 2013 the swaps which are designated as fair value hedges effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4377 plus libor at december 31 2009 the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 06 and 22 lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments 

at december 31 2009 our outstanding variablerate borrowings were 40 million in revolver borrowings and the 500 million senior notes due 2013 an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 54 million 

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds or danish krone sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 23 of our total sales and 68 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar weakened against most currencies throughout 2009 which resulted in a 1 sales decrease due to foreign currency exchange the difference between 2009 operating income for these companies translated into us dollars at exchange rates experienced during 2009 and operating income translated into us dollars at exchange rates experienced during 2008 was 1 if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2009 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 17 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during 2009 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2008 resulted in an increase in net assets of 424 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 282 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

materials and suppliers 

we believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors thus far supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 127 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had approximately 524 million undrawn availability under our senior   unsecured credit facility as well as the ability to request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments not to exceed 350 million in aggregate our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to certain restrictions contained in our senior   unsecured credit facility we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance or which is assumed in connection with acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

our senior   unsecured credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our senior   unsecured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our senior unsecured credit facility could result in an event of default under this facility which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior   unsecured credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds danish krone and japanese yen sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented approximately 24 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 28 for the year ended december 31 2007 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings at present we do not hedge against foreign currency risks 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for approximately 16 and 17 of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could materially negatively affect our future sales and earnings 

the effects of the recent global financial crisis and general weakness in the global economy may impact our business   

 

the recent global financial crisis and general weakness in the global economy have resulted in a general tightening in the credit markets lower levels of liquidity and corresponding increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and extreme volatility in credit equity and fixed income markets these macroeconomic developments have had adverse effects on our customers and could have adverse effects on our business including decreased revenue from the sales of products and increased financing costs due to the failure of financial institutions the combination of some or all of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 19 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our future growth is likely to depend to some degree on our ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets once integrated acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers’ liability insurance our insurance costs increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from large customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 

changes in the supply of or price for parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

we purchase many parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices of parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial energy and semiconductor markets accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business 

our intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2008 goodwill totaled 212 billion compared to 200 billion of stockholders’ equity which was 53 of our total assets of 397 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations decline we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our ability to develop new products and any failure to develop or market new products could adversely affect our business 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions in the us and abroad to deteriorate or cause worldwide demand for us products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the us or in other areas of the world could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 

overview 

we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging products and software industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including rf applications water energy research and medical education security and other niche markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments on february 20 2008 we purchased cbord holdings corp “cbord” a provider of card systems and integrated security solutions to higher education healthcare and other markets on march 20 2008 we acquired techpro inc “techpro” a manufacturer of physical testing instruments for the rubber and plastic industries on june 18 2008 we purchased chalwyn limited “chalwyn” an air shutoff valve provider on july 17 2008 we purchased the assets intellectual property and internet domain names of getloadedcom llc “getloaded” adding new subscribers to our existing freight matching services on august 27 2008 we purchased horizon software holdings inc “horizon” a provider of comprehensive software solutions and related services for the k12 education market on september 10 2008 we purchased technolog holdings limited “technolog” an endtoend solutions provider for network monitoring pressure management automatic meter reading and smart metering solutions 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2008 included in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements 

effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which requires the company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards the company recognizes the expense of all sharebased awards on a straightline basis over the employee’s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the award 

on january 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” this interpretation requires the company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory valuation future warranty obligations revenue recognition percent of completion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns exchanges discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2008 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 112 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 15 million for a total of 127 million or 32 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2008 is 08 million higher than at december 31 2007 and is unchanged as a percent of sales 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances at december 31 2008 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 301 million or 139 of gross inventory cost as compared to 284 million or 140 of gross inventory cost at december 31 2007 the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory 

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized revenue of approximately 1279 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects approximately 1355 million and 948 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 respectively at december 31 2008 approximately 2068 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2008 our effective income tax rate was 343 which was lower than the 2007 rate of 348 due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives 

roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june 30 2001 and establishes a twostep method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value total goodwill includes 25 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately 502 million sfas 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized but separately tested for impairment using a onestep fair value based approach roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2008 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales 

 

 

 

 

 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 were 231 billion as compared to sales of 210 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 an increase of 97 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and internal growth our 2008 results included a full year of sales from our 2007 acquisitions of jlt dj instruments roda deaco dynamic instruments and black diamond these results also included ten months of sales from cbord nine months from techpro six months from chalwyn five months from getloaded four months from horizon and three months from technolog net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 133 million of our 2008 net sales increase over 2007 and growth of our other business accounted for 71 million of the increase or internal growth of 34 including a 1 foreign currency exchange impact 

 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported a 06 million or 02 decrease in net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 over the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease was attributable to the year over year impact of the removal of the redlake motion camera product line internal growth for 2008 was 08 led by increased sales in our medical businesses partially offset by slowing sales in our industrial camera businesses 

 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by 318 million or 62 over the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 18 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2007 acquisitions of dj instruments roda deaco and dynamic instruments as well as partial year results from the 2008 acquisitions of techpro and chalwyn internal growth was approximately 14 million or 28 led by strength in our protective technology and oil and gas pipeline controls businesses 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 432 million or 67 for the year ended december 31 2008 over the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was due to broadbased moderate growth in all businesses in this segment 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 increased by 1300 million or 230 over the year ended december 31 2007 the partial year results from the acquisitions of cbord getloaded horizon and technolog and fullyear results of 2007 acquisitions accounted for approximately 119 million of the increase internal growth increased 19 due to growth in our intelligent traffic systems business offset by anticipated declines in our large middle east project as it transitions from the design and installation phase to operations and maintenance 

our overall gross profit percentage was 515 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 504 for the year ended december 31 2007 due to operating leverage on increased sales our industrial technology energy systems and controls and scientific and industrial imaging segments gross margins were relatively unchanged in 2008 as compared to 2007 our rf technology segment gross margins increased to 508 in 2008 as compared to 468 in 2007 due to the favorable mix within existing businesses and higher gross margins at acquired businesses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased to 304 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2008 from 295 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase is primarily due to the higher sga structure in our education market businesses within the rf technology segment in addition corporate expenses increased due to higher equity compensation costs and the additional costs to the company due to the increase in roper’s stock price on the grant dates of stock awards 

interest expense increased 15 million or 28 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2008 offset by lower interest rates on our variable debt throughout the year 

the change in other income for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 was primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our nonus based companies on us dollar cash receivables and payables balances as the us dollar strengthened against most currencies in the fourth quarter of 2008 these foreign exchange gains were offset by a 31 million pretax debt restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility 

during 2008 our effective income tax rate was 343 versus 348 in 2007 this decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives 

at december 31 2008 the functional currencies of our european and canadian subsidiaries were weaker against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2007 the net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 867 million in the year ending december 31 2008 approximately 598 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2008 operating profit increased by less than 1 of sales due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 dollar amounts in thousands   

 

the increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 23 with the remainder from acquisitions the industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year net orders in the energy systems and controls segment increased due to the 2007 and 2008 acquisitions scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased due to strength in our medical business and camera sales into the security and teleconferencing application markets offset by decreases in industrial cameras sales the rf technology segment experienced strong order growth for projects in the tolling and traffic control businesses 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2008 and 2007 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 

 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2007 were 210 billion as compared to sales of 170 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of 236 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth our 2007 results included a full year of sales from our 2006 acquisitions of sinmed intellitrans lumenera ac controls and dynisco these results also included ten months of sales from jlt and dj instruments nine months from roda deaco six months from dynamic instruments and three months from black diamond all purchased in 2007 net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 158 million of our 2007 net sales increase over 2006 and growth of our other business accounted for 243 million of the increase or internal growth of 145 including a 2 foreign currency exchange impact 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 373 million or 110 for the year ended december 31 2007 over the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was attributable to the fullyear impact of sinmed and lumenera acquired in 2006 and partial year impact of jlt in 2007 which accounted for approximately 23 million of the increase over prior year internal growth was 42 which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from oem customers offset by weakness in our motion camera product line and decreased sales of handheld computers due to supplier issues encountered during the year the supplier issues were resolved in 2007 and did not impact operations in 2008 

 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2007 increased by 1727 million or 503 over the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 127 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2006 acquisitions of ac controls and dynisco as well as partial year results for dj instruments roda deaco and dynamic instruments internal growth was approximately 45 million or 14 primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market as well as improved market penetration in our control valve business 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 944 million or 172 for the year ended december 31 2007 over the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radiofrequency integrated water meter at neptune technologies accounting for 63 of the year over year growth in addition sales in our materials testing businesses were up 19 million over the prior year due to increased unit sales 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2007 increased by 969 million or 207 over the year ended december 31 2006 the fullyear results of intellitrans purchased in april 2006 and four months from the acquisition of black diamond on september 24 2007 accounted for approximately 7 million of the increase internal growth increased 193 due to strong performance in our traffic and tolling business which benefited in 2007 from a large middle east project that continued into 2008 

our overall gross profit percentage was 504 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 506 for the year ended december 31 2006 industrial technology gross margins increased to 482 as compared to 479 in the prior year our energy systems and controls segment gross margins decreased to 536 in 2007 as compared to 542 in 2006 due to the mix change within the segment caused by the inclusion of the lower gross margin dynisco business our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 549 in 2007 as compared to 568 in 2006 due primarily to the additional costs related to the dap touch screen quality issue our rf technology segment gross margins remained constant at 468 in both 2007 and 2006 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 295 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2007 from 308 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses 

interest expense increased 74 million or 165 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2007 related to the november 30 2006 acquisition of dynisco and additional borrowings throughout the year for the 2007 acquisitions offset by payments on these balances throughout the year 

the change in other income for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 was primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies on us dollar cash receivables and payables balances as the us dollar weakened against most currencies in 2007 

during 2007 our effective income tax rate was 348 versus 340 in 2006 this increase was due primarily to the expiration of the extraterritorial income inclusion offset somewhat by an increased benefit from our foreign rate differential 

at december 31 2007 the functional currencies of our european and canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2006 the net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 523 million in the year period ending december 31 2007 approximately 348 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2007 operating profit increased by approximately 1 of sales due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 dollar amounts in thousands 

 

 

the increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 97 with the remainder from acquisitions the industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year net orders in the energy systems and controls segment increased due to the 2006 and 2007 acquisitions which accounted for 387 of the increase in addition there was strong internal growth in our fluid properties testing nondestructive testing and valve and control businesses scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from 2006 and 2007 acquisitions and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market which led to the higher backlog at 2007 in the scientific and industrial imaging segment the rf technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project which began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continued throughout 2007 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2007 and 2006 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities was 4344 million for the year ended december 31 2008 3438 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 2625 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the 2008 increase was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and improved receivables collection cash used by investing activities during 2008 2007 and 2006 were primarily business acquisition costs cash from financing activities during each of these years was largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions financing activities in 2008 included replacing our previous 1355 billion secured credit facility with our current 11 billion unsecured credit facility and the issuance of our 500 million senior notes 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 2949 million at december 31 2008 compared to 3059 million at december 31 2007 we acquired approximately 79 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2008 

total debt was 13 billion at december 31 2008 387 of total capital compared to 11 billion at december 31 2007 372 of total capital our increased debt at december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 was due to the replacement of our previous 1355 billion secured credit facility with our current 11 billion unsecured credit facility and the issuance of our 500 million senior notes 

our 11 billion credit facility consists of a two year 350 million term loan and a five year 750 million revolving loan the weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the facility at december 31 2008 was 190 at december 31 2008 our debt consisted of 230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 500 million in senior notes due 2013 the 350 million term loan due 2010 and 179 million on the revolving loan in addition we had 85 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our nonus businesses the company had 511 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2008 of which 473 million were covered by our lending group thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately we expect that our available borrowing capacity combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 2008 

capital expenditures of 300 million 301 million and 322 million were incurred during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in the future we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be less than 2 of annual sales 

description of certain indebtedness 

senior unsecured credit facility  on july 7 2008 the company entered into a new 11 billion unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders which replaces its 1355 billion amended and restated secured credit facility dated as of december 13 2004 the 11 billion facility is composed of a 350 million term loan facility maturing july 7 2010 and a five year 750 million revolving credit facility maturing july 7 2013 the company may also subject to compliance with specified conditions request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 350 million 

the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 35 

senior notes  on august 6 2008 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes due august 15 2013 the “notes” the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6625 per year payable semiannually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year beginning february 15 2009 the interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes 

we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at 100 of their principal amount plus a makewhole premium based on a spread to us treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes 

the notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness the notes are effectively subordinated to any of the company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the notes are not guaranteed by any of the company’s subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the company’s subsidiaries 

senior subordinated convertible notes  in december 2003 we issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes is payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after that date we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable instead after january 15 2009 interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 375 and will represent accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 

the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 

as originally issued each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12422 shares of our common stock giving effect to the 2for1 stock split effective august 26 2005 and subject to further adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we would have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock on november 19 2004 the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes but would change how the conversion value is paid in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and at the company’s option any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december 6 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2009 january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after january 15 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date 

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon the company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005 

in accordance with eitf 048 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” the company is required to include in its diluted weightedaverage common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 3180 this is calculated using the treasury stock method 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2008 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

we have excluded 26 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions under fin 48 from the tables as the current portion is not material and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

at december 31 2008 the company had outstanding surety bonds of 239 million 

at december 31 2008 and 2007 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2009 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

recently issued accounting standards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2008 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our 11 billion senior credit facility contains 350 million in variable rate term loans and a 750 million variable rate revolver at december 31 2008 the weighted average interest rate was 190 on the variable portion of the term loans and revolver our 500 million senior notes have a fixed interest rate of 6625 and our 230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375 at december 31 2008 the prevailing market rates for long term notes were between 18 and 47 higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments 

at december 31 2008 roper’s outstanding variablerate borrowings under the 11 billion credit facility were 529 million an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 53 million 

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds danish krone or japanese yen sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 24 of our total sales and 71 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar weakened against most currencies during the first three quarters of 2008 and then strengthened significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 which resulted in a 1 sales increase due to foreign currency exchange the difference between 2008 operating income for these companies translated into us dollars during 2008 and operating income translated into us dollars during 2007 was less than 1 if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2008 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately 35 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during 2008 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2007 resulted in a decrease in net assets of 867 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 598 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

we believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors thus far supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation   

our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we are required continually to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

competition   

generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

patents and trademarks   

in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own or license the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees to protect our trade secrets and knowhow while we believe that our operating units are not substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights the product development and market activities of compressor controls neptune technology  transcore and our medical and imaging businesses  in particular have been planned and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent and license strategies 

employees 

as of december 31 2007  we had approximately 7100 total employees with approximately 5200 located in the united states approximately 275 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business   

our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2007  we had approximately  10 6 b illion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had approximately  344 million undrawn availability under our senior secured credit facility our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility and other debt agreements we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance or which is assumed in connection with acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

· 

place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than us 

tableend · 

limit our ability to borrow additional funds 

tableend · 

limit our ability to complete future acquisitions 

tableend · 

limit our ability to pay dividends 

tableend · 

limit our ability to make capital expenditures and 

tableend · 

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

tableend 

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected   in addition our senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility could result in an event of default under this facility which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds  danish krone and japanese yen  sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented approximately 28  of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 29  for the year ended december 31 2006  unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings at present we do not hedge against foreign currency risks 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for approximately 17  and 14  of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2007 and december 31 2006  respectively we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

· 

unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with us and other jurisdictions export requirements 

tableend · 

restrictions on the export of technology and related products 

tableend · 

unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with us and other jurisdictions export policies to certain countries 

tableend · 

unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets and 

tableend · 

a general economic downturn in our foreign markets 

tableend 

the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could materially negatively affect our future sales and earnings   

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2007  approximately 1 8  of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles  were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to continue to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following   

· 

adverse changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions particularly in emerging markets 

tableend · 

trade protection measures and import or export requirements 

tableend · 

trade liberalization measures which could expose our international operations to increased competition 

tableend · 

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations 

tableend · 

partial or total expropriation 

tableend · 

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

tableend · 

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

tableend · 

differing labor regulations 

tableend · 

differing protection of intellectual property 

tableend · 

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

tableend · 

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty in collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions and 

tableend · 

international sentiment towards the us 

tableend 

the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend to some degree on our ability to make acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquired businesses we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally there are no assurances  however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets once integrated acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected   acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities d ifficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers ’ liability insurance our insurance costs increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results   

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses w e derive a significant amount of revenue from larger customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations g overnment entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities with existing customers we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive   

changes in the supply of or price for parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

we purchase many parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices of parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components could affect our business financial condition and results of operations   

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change   we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial  energy and semiconductor markets  accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business   

our intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2007  goodwill totaled  171 billion compared to  17 9 billion of stockholders equity which was 49  o f our total assets of  345 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations become more conservative we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material   

we depend on our abilities to develop new products 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful   

any business disruption due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance  

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions in the us and abroad to deteriorate or cause worldwide demand for us products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the u  s  or in other areas of the world could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 

overview 

we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging products and software industrial technology products and radio frequency rf products and services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including rf applications water energy research and medical security and other niche markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments on february 21 2007  we purchased jlt  a provider of rugged computers and software for mobile computing  on february 28 2007  we purchased dj instruments  a manufacturer and provider of pressure measurement sensors  on march 22 2007  we purchased roda deaco  a developer and manufacturer of air intake cut  off devices  on june 21 2007  we purchased dynamic instruments  a provider of audio recording vibration monitoring and process control equipment for commercial and military markets  on september 24 2007  we purchased black diamond  a provider of rugged mobile computers  the results of dj instruments roda deaco and dynamic instruments are reported in the energy systems and controls segment  jlt in the scientific and industrial imaging segment and black diamond in the rf technology segment  

during the year ended december 31 2007  our results of operations benefited from the fullyear results of the 2006 acquisitions of intellitrans and sinmed in april  ac controls in july  lumenera in august and dynisco i n november as well as t he partial year activities of jlt dj instruments  roda deaco  dynamic instruments and black diamond  

during the year ended december 31 2006 our results of operations benefited from the fullyear results of the 2005 acquisitions of inovonics civco and medtec in february june and november respectively as well as the partial year activities of intellitrans sinmed ac controls lumenera and dynisco 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2007 included elsewhere in this annual report   

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depr eciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue  we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment “sfas 123r”” which requires the company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards the company recognizes the expense of all sharebased awards on a straightline basis over the employee’s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the award 

on january 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” this interpretation requires the company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures   the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our b oard of d irectors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory utilization future warranty obligations revenue recognition percent of completion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting   accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 200 7  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was  103 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was  1 6 million for a total of  119 million or 32  of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables  and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible  the total allowance at december 31 200 7 is  29 million higher than at december 31 200 6 and has in creased slightly as a percent of sales by 04    we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances at december 31 200 7  inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were  284 million or 140  of gross invent ory cost this percentage has in creased from 135  at december 31 200 6  the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory   most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback at december 31 200 7  the reserve for future warranty obligations was  85 million our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 200 7  200 6  and 200 5    revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 200 7  we recognized revenue of approximately  1355 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects approximately  948 million and  900 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended december 31 200 6 and december 31 200 5  respectively at december 31 200 7  approximately  1336 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods   income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 200 7  our effective income tax rate was 34 8  which was higher than the 200 6 rate of 340   

roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives s fas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june 30 2001 and establishes a twostep method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value total goodwill includes 22 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately 451 million sfas 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized but separately tested for impairment using a onestep fair value based approach roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2007 

results of operations 

general 

the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales results from 2005 have been revised to conform to the current segment presentation

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006  

net sales for the year ended december 31 200 7 were  210 b illion as compared to sales of  170 billion for the year ended december 31 200 6  an increase of 236  this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth our 200 7 results included a full year of sales from our 2006 acquisitions of sinmed  intellitrans  lumenera  ac controls and dynisco  these results also included ten months of sales from jlt and dj instruments nine months from roda deaco six months from dynamic instruments and three months from black diamond  all purchased in 2007  net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately  158 million of our 200 7 net sales increase over 200 6 and growth of our o ther business accounted for  243 million of the increase  or internal growth of 1 4 5 including a 2 foreign currency exchange impact 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by  944 million or 172  for the year ended december 31 200 7 over the year ended december 31 200 6  the increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radiofrequency integrated water meter at neptune technologies accounting for 6 3  of the year over year growth in addition sales in our material s testing businesses were up 19 million over the prior year due to increased unit sales    in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 200 7 increased by  1727 million or 503  over the year ended december 31 200 6  approximately  127 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2006 acquisitions of ac controls and dynisco  as well as partial year results for dj instruments roda deaco and dynamic instruments  internal growth was ap proximately  45 million or 1 4  primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses  which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market  as well as improved market penetration in our control valve business  

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of  373 million or 11 0  for the year ended december 31 200 7 over the year ended december 31 200 6  the increase was attributable to the full year impact of sinmed and lumenera acquired in 200 6  and partial year impact of jlt in 200 7  which a ccounted for approximately  23 million of the increase over prior year internal growth was 42  which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from oem customers offset by weakness in our motion camera product line and decreased sales of handheld computers due to supplier issues encountered during the year the supplier issues have been resolved and we do not expect an adverse impact from these supplier issues going into 2008 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 200 7 increased by  969 million or 207  over the year ended december 31 200 6  the full year results of intellitrans  purchased in april 2006 and four months from the acquisition of black diamond on september 24  2007  accounted for approximately 7 million of the increase  internal growth increased 193  due to strong performance in our traffic and tolling business  which benefited in the current year from a large middle east project which will continue into 2008 

our overall gross profit percentage was 50 4  for the year ended december 31 200 7  as compared to 50 6  for the year ended december 31 200 6  industrial technology gross margins in creased to 482  as compared to 479  in the prior year  our energy systems and controls segment gross margins decreased to 536 in 2007 as compared to 54 2  in 2006  due to the mix change within the segment caused by the inclusion of the lower gross margin dynisco business our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 549  in 200 7 as compared to 568  in 200 6 due primarily to the additional costs related to the dap touch screen quality issue  our rf technology segment gross margins remained constant at 46 8  in both 2007 and 2006  

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased to 295  of net sales for the year ended december 31 200 7 from 3 0 8  of net sales for the year ended december 31 200 6  the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses  interest expense increased  74 million or 165  for the year ended december 31 200 7 compared to the year ended december 31 200 6  primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2007 related to the november 30 2006 acquisition of dynisco and additional borrowing s throughout the year for the 2007 acquisitions offset by payments on these balances throughout the year 

the change in other income for the year ended december 31 200 7 as compared to the year ended december 31 200 6 was primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our nonus based companies on us dollar cash receivables and payables balances as the us dollar weakened against most currencies in 2007  

during 200 7  our effective income tax rate was 348 versus 3 40  in 2006 this increase was due primarily to the expiration of the extraterritorial income inclusion offset somewhat by an increased benefit from our foreign rate differential 

at december 31 200 7  the functional currencies of our european and canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 200 6  the net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of  523 million in the year period ending december 31 200 7  approximately  348 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 200 7  operating profit increased by approximately 1 of sales due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 200 7 and 200 6 dollar amounts in thousands   

 the increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 9 7 with the remainder from acquisitions the industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year net orders in the energy systems and controls segment increased due to the 2006 and 2007 acquisitions which accounted for 387 of the increase in addition there was strong internal growth in our fluid properties testing nondestructive testing and valve and control businesses scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders f rom 2006 and 2007 acquisitions an d also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market  which led to the higher backlog at 2007 in the scientific and industrial imaging segment  the rf technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project which began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continued throughout 2007  

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2007 and 2006 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005   

net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 were 170 billion as compared to sales of 145 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 170 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth our 2006 results included a full year of sales from inovonics civco and medtec acquired during 2005 approximately eight months of sales from sinmed seven months from intellitrans five months from lumenera and ac controls and one month from dynisco net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 101 million of our 2006 net sales increase over 2005 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining 146 million of the increase   net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 539 million or 109 for the year ended december 31 2006 over the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radiofrequency integrated water meter at neptune technologies accounting for 68 of the year over year growth in addition sales in our materials testing businesses were up 11 million dollars over the prior year due to increased unit sales   in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by 325 million or 104 over the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 19 million or 6 of the increase was due to the 2006 acquisitions of ac controls and dynisco internal growth was approximately 14 million or 44 primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses which benefited from the strong global oil and gas market offset by weak sales at zetec in the first half of 2006   our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 890 million or 356 for the year ended december 31 2006 over the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was attributable to the fullyear impact of civco and medtec acquired in 2005 and partial year impact of sinmed and lumenera in 2006 which accounted for approximately 65 million of the increase over prior year internal growth was 97 approximately 50 of which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from oem customers sales of new products in the digital camera businesses accounted for the remainder of the growth   in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by 716 million or 180 over the year ended december 31 2005 the fullyear results of inovonics purchased in february 2005 and eight months from the intellitrans acquisition on april 26 2006 accounted for approximately 17 million of the increase internal growth increased 138 due to strong performance in the freight matching business and our traffic and tolling business   our overall gross profit percentage was 506 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 500 for the year ended december 31 2005 industrial technology gross margins increased to 479 as compared to 474 in the prior year our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were unchanged at 542 in both 2006 and 2005 however there was a 11 million purchase accounting inventory stepup charge incurred in 2006 our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 568 in 2006 as compared to 556 in 2005 there were purchase accounting inventory stepup charges of 13 million in 2006 and 21 million in 2005 excluding these charges our gross margins would have increased in 2006 due to a larger percentage of segment sales in our higher margin medical businesses our rf technology segment gross margins were 468 in 2006 as compared to 464 in 2005   selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased to 308 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 from 318 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease was due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses   interest expense increased 14 million or 32 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the dynisco acquisition on november 30 2006 the average debt balances and associated interest expense for the remaining 2006 acquisitions were relatively unchanged from the average debt balances and associated interest expense related to 2005 acquisitions   the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2005 created a 39 million noncash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which were required to be classified as shortterm debt based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the company’s stock   the change in other income for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 was primarily due to the 2005 08 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of 07 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our imaging segment businesses that did not recur in 2006   

during 2006 our effective income tax rate was 340 in 2005 our effective income tax rate was 306 which included a 66 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the internal revenue code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings as described above our tax rate in 2007 increase d to 349  as the company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the us subject to additional state income tax  

at december 31 2006 the functional currencies of our european and canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2005 the net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 236 million in the year period ending december 31 2006 approximately 207 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2006 operating profit increased by 1 of sales due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 dollar amounts in thousands 

 the increase in sales orders was due to internal growth of 127 with the remainder from acquisitions the industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for neptune water meter and rf products which was also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of sinmed and lumenera and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market which led to the higher backlog at 2006 in the scientific and industrial imaging segment the rf technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project awarded in the fourth quarter of 2006 leading to the increased backlog in this segment 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2006 and 2005 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities was  343 8 million for the year ended december 31 2007  2625 million for the year ended december 31 200 6 and  2813 million for the year ended december 31 200 5  the 2007 increase was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets related to our acquisitions cash used by investing activities during 200 7  200 6  and 200 5 were primarily business acquisition costs cash from financing activities during each of these years was largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions financing activities in 2007 included a 300 million increase to our current 1055 billion credit agreement by exercise of an accordion feature of the agreement  increasing the total to 1355 billion   net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was  3059 million at december 31 200 7 compared to  2703 million at december 31 200 6  we acquired approximately  75 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 200 7    total debt was  1 1 b illion at december 31 200 7  372  of total capital compared to  10 b illion at december 31 200 6  408  of total capital our increased debt at december 31 200 7 compared to december 31 200 6 was due to borrowings related to the exercise of the accordion feature of the credit facility to increase the companys liquidity   our 1 3 55 billion credit facility consists of a  9 55 million term loan and a 400 million revolving loan both with five year maturities in 2005 the company entered into a fixed rate swap agreement ending on march 13 2008 which fixes the interest rate on 250 million of our term notes the weighted average interest rate on the variable portion of our term loan at december 31 200 7 was 575  at december 31 200 7  our debt consisted of 230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 and a balance of  8237 million on the term loan in addition we had  48 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our nonus businesses the company had  563 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 200 7  thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately  we expect that our available borrowing capacity combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions    we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 200 7    capital expenditures of  301 million  322 million and  248 million were incurred during 200 7  200 6 and 200 5  respectively i n 200 8  we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be comparable to 200 7  

description of certain indebtedness 

senior secured credit facility 

i n december 2004 we entered into a 1055 billion senior secured credit facility which consist ed of a fiveyear 655 million term loan and a fiveyear 400 million revolving loan the credit agreement contained a 300 million term loan accordion which was exercised in december 2007 thereby increasing the term loan balance to 955 million and the credit facility to 1355 billion our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and in certain cases reduce the commitments under the revolving loan upon the receipt of certain proceeds including from certain asset sales the incurrence of certain debt and up to 75 of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test we are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans 

the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt prepay subordinated debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio   

senior subordinated convertible notes 

in december 2003 we issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes is payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after that date we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable instead after january 15 2009 interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 375 and will represent accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness as originally issued each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12422 shares of our common stock  giving effect to the 2for1 stock split effective august 26 2005 and subject to further adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we would have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock on november 19 2004 the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the n otes but would change how the conversion value is paid in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the n otes converted and at the company’s option any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december 6 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2009 january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after january 15 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date   

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon the company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005   

in accordance with eitf 048 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” the company is required to include in its diluted weightedaverage common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 3180 this is calculated using the treasury stock method 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies 

the following table s quantif y our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 200 7 dollars in thousands    

 includes in 2008 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability however the company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next 12 months 

 we have excluded 23 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions under fin 48 from the tables as the current portion is not material and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability see note 8 to the financial statements   

at december 31 2007  the company had outstanding surety bonds of  2016 million   

at december 31 2007 and 2006  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule  however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2008 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

recently issued accounting standards   

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp 1572 “partial deferral of the effective date of statement 157” fsp 1572 fsp 1572 delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations   in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest in the acquiree the provisions of sfas 141r are effective for business combinations occurring on or after january 1 2009   in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” sfas no 160 sfas no 160 establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company sometimes called “minority interests” be clearly identified presented and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity but separate from the parent’s equity all changes in the parent’s ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in deconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value sfas no 160 is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 however presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 160 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock   at december 31 200 7  we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our 1 3 55 billion senior credit facility contains  9 55 million in variable rate term loans and a 400 million variable rate revolver to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases in 2005 the company entered into a 250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring on march 13 2008  at december 31 200 7  the weighted average interest rate was 575 on the variable portion of the term loans and 454 on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap our 230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375  at december 31 200 7  the prevailing market rates were between 13  and 21  higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments   at december 31 200 7  roper’s outstanding variablerate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the 1 3 55 billion credit facility were  5737 million an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by  57 million    

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds danish krone or japanese yen sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 2 8  of our total sales and 68  of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar weakened against most currencies during 200 7  which resulted in a 2 sales increase due to foreign currency exchange t he difference between 200 7 operating results for these companies translated into us dollars during 200 7 and these operating results translated into us dollars during 200 6 was approximately 1  if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 200 7 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately  6 1 million 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during 200 7 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 200 6 resulted in a n in crease in net assets of  523 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings  348 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on o u r results of operations  the stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

 item 1 business   our business 

roper industries inc “roper” or the “company” was incorporated on december 17 1981 under the laws of the state of delaware we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging products and software industrial technology products and radio frequency rf products and services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including rf applications water energy researchmedical and general industry 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses that offer high valueadded services engineered products and solutions and are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins we compete in many niche markets and believe that we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in the majority of these markets 

in 2006 roper consolidated the number of our reporting segments from five to four reflecting the continued implementation of our marketfocus strategy roper’s four segments are industrial technology energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging and rf technology 

we continued our growth in 2006 from internal growth and the fullyear contributions from the 2005 acquisitions of inovonics corporation “inovonics” civco holding inc “civco” and medtec inc “medtec” in february june and november respectively we acquired sinmed holding international bv “sinmed” on april 5 2006 intellitrans llc “intellitrans” on april 26 2006 lumenera corporation “lumenera” on july 25 2006 ac analytical controls holding bv “ac controls” on august 8 2006 and dynisco parent inc “dynisco” on november 30 2006 all of which were purchased for cash and financed through borrowings under our credit agreement and cash generated from operations

customers   no customer was responsible for as much as 10 of this segment’s net sales for 2006 

materials and suppliers we believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors thus far supply shortages have not had a significant adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we are required continually to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

competition generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

patents and trademarks in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees to protect our trade secrets and knowhow while we believe that none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights the product development and market activities of compressor controls neptune technology transcore and our medical and imaging businesses in particular have been planned and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent strategies while we have not significantly licensed patents trademarks trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from third parties in the past we may do so in the future 

employees as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 6900 total employees of whom approximately 5000 were located in the united states approximately 290 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 




 item 1a risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 10 billion in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had approximately 144 million undrawn availability under our senior secured credit facility our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility and other debt agreements we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance or which is assumed in connection with acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than us limit our ability to borrow additional funds limit our ability to complete future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

in addition our senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility could result in an event of default under this facility which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds danish krone and japanese yen sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented approximately 29 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 25 for the year ended december 31 2005 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings at present we do not hedge against foreign currency risks 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for approximately 14 and 16 of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with us and other jurisdictions export requirements restrictions on the export of technology and related products unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with us and other jurisdictions export policies to certain countries unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could materially negatively affect our future sales and earnings 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2006 approximately 17 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to continue to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

adverse changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions particularly in emerging markets trade protection measures and import or export requirements trade liberalization measures which could expose our international operations to increased competition subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations partial or total expropriation potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property unexpected changes in regulatory requirements longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty in collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions and international sentiment towards the us the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend to some degree on our ability to make acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquired businesses we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets once integrated acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers’ liability insurance our insurance costs increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

in some of our businesses we derive a significant amount of revenue from larger customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities in many situations government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities with existing customers we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 

changes in the supply of or price for parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

we purchase many parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices of parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and semiconductor markets accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business 

our intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2006 goodwill totaled approximately 165 billion compared to approximately 149 billion of stockholders’ equity which was approximately 55 of our total assets of approximately 300 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations become more conservative we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our abilities to develop new products 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions in the us and abroad to deteriorate or cause worldwide demand for us products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the us or in other areas of the world could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 

overview we are a diversified growth company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging products and software industrial technology products and radio frequency rf products and services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including rf applications water energy researchmedical and general industry 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments on april 5 2006 we purchased sinmed a maker of medical positioning equipment on april 26 2006 we purchased intellitrans a provider of asset tracking technology on july 25 2006 we purchased lumenera a developer and manufacturer of high performance digital cameras for industrial scientific and security markets on august 8 2006 we purchased ac controls a provider of chromatographic analyzers for the petrochemical industry on november 30 2006 we purchased dynisco a provider of highly engineered sensors and software used in testing measurement and control applications the results of sinmed and lumenera are reported in the scientific and industrial imaging segment intellitrans in the rf technology segment and ac controls and dynisco in the energy systems and controls segment 

during the year ended december 31 2006 our results of operations benefited from the fullyear results of the 2005 acquisitions of inovonics civco and medtec in february june and november respectively as well as the partial year activities of intellitrans sinmed ac controls lumenera and dynisco 

during the year ended december 31 2005 our results of operations benefited from the transcore acquisition made on december 13 2004 the power generation business of rd tech purchased on june 7 2004 and the partial year activities of inovonics civco and medtec 

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 included elsewhere in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets and recognizing revenue we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment “sfas 123r”” which requires the company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards the company recognizes the expense of all sharebased awards on a straightline basis over the employee’s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the award 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory utilization future warranty obligations revenue recognition percent of completion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2006 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 78 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 12 million for a total of 90 million or 27 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible the total allowance at december 31 2006 is 04 million higher than at december 31 2005 but has decreased as percent of sales by 05 as we continue to reduce our credit risk 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances at december 31 2006 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 264 million or 135 of gross firstin firstout inventory cost this percentage has decreased from 154 in the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 we expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time as we physically dispose of obsolete inventory and improve our inventory purchasing processes 

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback at december 31 2006 the reserve for future warranty obligations was 76 million our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 2006 we recognized revenue of approximately 948 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects approximately 900 million and 168 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively at december 31 2006 approximately 139 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2006 our effective income tax rate was 340 which was higher than the 2005 rate of 306 which included a onetime 66 million reduction of tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the internal revenue code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings we expect our tax rate in 2007 to increase to approximately 350 to 355 as the company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the us subject to additional state income tax 

roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives statement of financial accounting standard no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june 30 2001 and establishes a twostep method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value roper conducts this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year no impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2006 sfas 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized but separately tested for impairment using a onestep fair value based approach total goodwill includes 22 different reporting units with individual amounts ranging from less than 1 million to approximately 447 million 

results of operations general the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales prior period presentations have been revised to conform to the new segments 

    year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 were 170 billion as compared to sales of 145 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 170 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth our 2006 results included a full year of sales from inovonics civco and medtec acquired during 2005 approximately eight months of sales from sinmed seven months from intellitrans five months from lumenera and ac controls and one month from dynisco net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 101 million of our 2006 net sales increase over 2005 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining 146 million of the increase 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 539 million or 109 for the year ended december 31 2006 over the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radiofrequency integrated water meter at neptune technologies accounting for 68 of the year over year growth in addition sales in our materials testing businesses were up 11 million dollars over the prior year due to increased unit sales 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by 325 million or 104 over the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 19 million or 6 of the increase was due to the 2006 acquisitions of ac controls and dynisco internal growth was approximately 14 million or 44 primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market offset by weak sales at zetec in the first half of 2006 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 890 million or 356 for the year ended december 31 2006 over the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was attributable to the fullyear impact of civco and medtec acquired in 2005 and partial year impact of sinmed and lumenera in 2006 which accounted for approximately 65 million of the increase over prior year internal growth was 97 approximately 50 of which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from oem customers sales of new products in the digital camera businesses accounted for the remainder of the growth 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by 716 million or 180 over the year ended december 31 2005 the fullyear results of inovonics purchased in february 2005 and eight months from the intellitrans acquisition on april 26 2006 accounted for approximately 17 million of the increase internal growth increased 138 due to strong performance in the freight matching business and our traffic and tolling business 

our overall gross profit percentage was 506 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 500 for the year ended december 31 2005 industrial technology gross margins increased to 479 as compared to 474 in the prior year our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were unchanged at 542 in both 2006 and 2005 however there was a 11 million purchase accounting inventory stepup charge incurred in 2006 our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 568 in 2006 as compared to 556 in 2005 there were purchase accounting inventory stepup charges of 13 million in 2006 and 21 million in 2005 excluding these charges our gross margins would have increased in 2006 due to a larger percentage of segment sales in our higher margin medical businesses our rf technology segment gross margins were 468 in 2006 as compared to 464 in 2005 

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased to 308 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 from 318 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses 

interest expense increased 14 million or 32 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the dynisco acquisition on november 30 2006 the average debt balances and associated interest expense for the remaining 2006 acquisitions were relatively unchanged from the average debt balances and associated interest expense related to 2005 acquisitions 

the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2005 created a 39 million noncash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which were required to be classified as shortterm debt based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the company’s stock 

the change in other income for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 was primarily due to the 2005 08 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of 07 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our imaging segment businesses that did not recur in 2006 

during 2006 our effective income tax rate was 340 in 2005 our effective income tax rate was 306 which included a 66 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the internal revenue code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings we expect our tax rate in 2007 to increase to approximately 350 to 355 as the company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the us subject to additional state income tax  

at december 31 2006 the functional currencies of our european and canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2005 the net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 236 million in the year period ending december 31 2006 approximately 207 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2006 operating profit increased by 1 of sales due to fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 dollar amounts in thousands 

 the increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 127 with the remainder from acquisitions the industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for neptune water meter and rf products which is also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of sinmed and lumenera and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market which led to the higher backlog at 2006 in the scientific and industrial imaging segment the rf technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project awarded in the fourth quarter of 2006 leading to the increased backlog in this segment 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2006 and 2005 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 were 145 billion as compared to sales of 9698 million for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 499 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth our 2005 results included a full year of sales from the power generation business of rd tech and from transcore both acquired during 2004 approximately ten months of sales from the inovonics acquisition six months from civco and one month from medtec net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 413 million of our 2005 net sales increase over 2004 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining 71 million of the increase 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 380 million or 83 for the year ended december 31 2005 over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions including strong sales growth in radio frequency technology in our water meter markets representing approximately 10 million increased sales of standard products in our water and waste water pumps of approximately 5 million and increased sales of approximately 4 million in sulfur testing instruments as this testing moved from lab to process applications with our customers 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 increased by 324 million or 116 over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily due to increased internal growth in all business units in this segment along with the fullyear impact of the power generation business of rd tech acquired in 2004 of approximately 94 million 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 321 million or 148 for the year ended december 31 2005 over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was attributable to the partialyear impact of civco and medtec acquired in 2005 which accounted for approximately 22 million of the increase over prior year the remainder of the increase resulted primarily from new products and more focused selling activities driving market penetration in our physical and life sciences camera markets 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 increased by 3814 million over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was attributable to the fullyear results of transcore purchased december 13 2004 and the ten month results of inovonics 

our overall gross profit percentage was 500 for the year ended december 31 2005 which remained the same as 500 for the year ended december 31 2004 industrial technology gross margins increased to 474 as compared to 463 in the prior year primarily due to the nonrecurrence of inventory stepup costs at neptune in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately 15 million our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were 542 in 2005 as compared to 522 in 2004 this was due to several factors none of which are easily quantifiable including a product rationalization effort in our nondestructive testing business better large project scope acceptance discipline and better engineering staff utilization in our oil and gas business our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 556 in 2005 as compared to 557 in 2004 this decrease is due totally to inventory stepup costs of approximately 21 million at civco and medtec incurred in 2005 without these charges there was a modest improvement in this segment’s gross margins for the year our rf technology segment gross margins were 464 in 2005 as compared to 404 for the 18 day period that transcore was owned in 2004 prior year gross margins were depressed due to the low sales volume in the holiday period of our ownership in the prior year 

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased to 318 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 from 324 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses 

interest expense increased 145 million or 504 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the transcore acquisition in december 2004 and borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the inovonics civco and medtec acquisitions in 2005 

the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2005 was a 39 million noncash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which are required to be classified as shortterm debt based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the company’s stock the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2004 was a 82 million noncash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs due to the amendment of our credit facility concurrent with the acquisition of transcore 

the change in other income for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 was primarily due to a 08 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of 07 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our imaging segment businesses 

during 2005 our effective income tax rate was 306 which included a 66 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the internal revenue code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings in 2004 our effective income tax rate was 298 which included a 09 million additional rd credit we expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase as the company does not expect a recurrence of the 2005 reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings 

at december 31 2005 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were weaker and the functional currencies of our canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2004 the net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 279 million in the year period ending december 31 2005 approximately 218 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2005 operating profit was not affected by fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 dollar amounts in thousands 

 industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for neptune water meter and rf products which is also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of civco and medtec and also from stronger orders for industrial cameras and handheld computers which leads to the higher backlog at 2005 in the scientific and industrial imaging segment 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2005 and 2004 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 financial condition liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was 2625 million for the year ended december 31 2006 2813 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and 1648 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 2006 decrease was expected due to higher tax payments in 2006 as net operating losses from previous acquisitions were depleted and we were required to reclassify cash flows from the tax windfall benefits related to stock awards from operating cash flows to financing cash flows these benefits were 108 million and 42 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively cash used by investing activities during 2006 2005 and 2004 were primarily business acquisition costs cash from financing activities during each of these years was largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions and a common stock issuance in 2004 financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous 625 million credit agreement with our current 1055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity lower borrowing costs and improve other terms and conditions 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 2703 million at december 31 2006 compared to 2128 million at december 31 2005 we acquired approximately 211 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2006 

total debt was 10 billion at december 31 2006 408 of total capital compared to 8943 million at december 31 2005 417 of total capital our increased debt at december 31 2006 compared to december 31 2005 was due to borrowings related to our acquisition of dynisco on november 30 2006 

our 1055 billion credit facility consists of a 655 million term loan and a 400 million revolving loan both with five year maturities in 2005 the company entered into a fixed rate swap agreement ending march 2008 which fixes the interest rate on 250 million of our term notes the interest rate on the variable portion of our term loan at december 31 2006 was 611 at december 31 2006 our debt consisted of 230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 a balance of 5888 million on the term loan and a balance of 2020 million on the revolving loan in addition we had 60 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our nonus businesses the company had 542 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2006 thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately we expect that our available borrowing capacity combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 2006 

capital expenditures of 322 million 248 million and 121 million were incurred during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in capital expenditures in 2006 was due to the consolidation of several of our businesses in the energy systems and controls segment including new facilities in houston texas and snoqualmie washington we also had increased expenditures related to cost saving initiatives at our neptune facility we expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be approximately comparable as a percentage of sales to 2006 

description of certain indebtedness senior secured credit facility 

concurrently with the closing of the transcore acquisition and the common stock offering in december 2004 we entered into a 1055 billion senior secured credit facility this credit facility consists of a fiveyear 655 million term loan and a fiveyear 400 million revolving loan 

our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and in certain cases reduce the commitments under the revolving loan upon the receipt of certain proceeds including from certain asset sales the incurrence of certain debt and up to 75 of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test we are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans 

the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt prepay subordinated debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio 

senior subordinated convertible notes 

in december 2003 we issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes is payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after that date we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable instead after january 15 2009 interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 375 and will represent accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 

the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 

as originally issued each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12422 shares of our common stock giving effect to the 2for1 stock split effective august 26 2005 and subject to further adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we would have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock on november 19 2004 the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes but would change how the conversion value is paid in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and at the company’s option any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december 6 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2009 january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after january 15 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date 

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon the company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005 

in accordance with eitf 048 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” the company is required to include in its diluted weightedaverage common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 3180 this is calculated using the treasury stock method 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies the following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 includes in 2007 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability however the company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next 12 months 

 at december 31 2006 the company had outstanding surety bonds of 1375 million 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2007 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

recently issued accounting standards in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum standards for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under the requirements of fin 48 the company must review all of its uncertain tax positions and make a determination as to whether its position is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by regulatory authorities if a position meets the morelikelythannot criterion then the related tax benefit is measured based on the cumulative probability analysis of the amount that is morelikelythannot to be realized upon ultimate settlement fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the company will adopt the provisions of fin 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007 the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on january 1 2007 while our analysis of the impact of this interpretation is not yet complete we do not anticipate it will have a material impact on our retained earnings at the time of adoption 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations

in september 2006 the sec issued sab 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” this standard addresses quantifying the financial statement effect of misstatements specifically how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements this standard is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 the adoption of sab 108 did not impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” aug air1 “accounting for planned major maintenance activities” fsp aug air1 fsp aug air1 amends the guidance on the accounting for planned major maintenance activities specifically it precludes the use of the previously acceptable “accrue in advance” method fsp aug air1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we will adopt the provisions of fsp aug air1 beginning in the first quarter of 2007 and do not expect fsp aug air1 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

information about forward looking statements this annual report includes and incorporates by reference “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws in addition we or our executive officers on our behalf may from time to time make forwardlooking statements in reports and other documents we file with the sec or in connection with oral statements made to the press potential investors or others all statements that are not historical facts are “forwardlooking statements” the words “estimate” “project” “intend” “expect” “believe” “anticipate” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position business financing plans business strategy business prospects revenues working capital liquidity capital needs interest costs and income in each case relating to our company as a whole as well as statements regarding acquisitions potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions 

forwardlooking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forwardlooking statements these statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions which in turn are based on currently available information examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions important assumptions relating to the forwardlooking statements include among others assumptions regarding demand for our products the cost timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions raw materials costs expected pricing levels the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures expected outcomes of pending litigation competitive conditions general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions joint ventures and alliances these assumptions could prove inaccurate although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable our expectations may prove to be incorrect important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forwardlooking statements include 

difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates difficulties associated with exports risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs risk of rising interest rates product liability and insurance risks increased warranty exposure future competition the cyclical nature of some of our markets reduction of business with large customers risks associated with government contracts changes in the supply of or price for parts and components environmental compliance costs and liabilities risks and costs associated with asbestosrelated litigation potential writeoffs of our substantial intangible assets our ability to successfully develop new products failure to protect our technology trade tariffs that may be applied due to the us governments delay in complying with certain wto directives terrorist attacks future health crises and the factors discussed in item 1a to this annual report under the heading risk factors we believe these forwardlooking statements are reasonable however you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements which are based on current expectations further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2006 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our 1055 billion senior credit facility contains 655 million variable rate term notes and a 400 million variable rate revolver to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases in 2005 the company entered into a 250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring march 13 2008 at december 31 2006 the interest rate on the variable portion of the term loans was 611 and 454 on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding revolver balance was 633 at december 31 2006 our 230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 375 at december 31 2006 the prevailing market rates were between 16 and 24 higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments 

at december 31 2006 roper’s outstanding variablerate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the 1055 billion credit facility were 5408 million an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 54 million 

several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds danish krone or japanese yen sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 29 of our total sales and 66 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar weakened against most currencies during 2006 with the exception of the japanese yen which weakened slightly against the us dollar however the average rates for 2006 and 2005 are very similar therefore the difference between 2006 operating results for these companies translated into us dollars during 2006 and these operating results translated into us dollars during 2005 was only 1 if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2006 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately 42 million 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during 2006 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2005 resulted in an increase in net assets of 236 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 207 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations the stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

customers no customer was responsible for as much as 10 of this segment’s net sales for 2005 

materials and suppliers we believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors thus far supply shortages have not had a significant adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we are required continually to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

competition generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

patents and trademarks in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees to protect our trade secrets and knowhow while we believe that none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights the product development and market activities of compressor controls neptune technology transcore and our imaging businesses in particular have been planned and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent strategies while we have not significantly licensed patents trademarks trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from third parties in the past we may do so in the future 

employees as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 6000 total employees of whom approximately 4450 were located in the united states approximately 210 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 




 item 1a risk factors risks relating to our business our indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 894 million in total consolidated indebtedness in addition we had approximately 315 million undrawn availability under our senior secured credit facility our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity subject to certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility and other debt agreements we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including indebtedness incurred to finance or which is assumed in connection with acquisitions 

our level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and business strategy for example our indebtedness could 

limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the industries in which we compete place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than us limit our ability to borrow additional funds limit our ability to complete future acquisitions limit our ability to pay dividends limit our ability to make capital expenditures and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by factors beyond our control in addition there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness if we are unable to service our indebtedness our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

in addition our senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our senior secured credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios tests or other restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility could result in an event of default under this facility which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facility and the expiration of any grace periods the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if this were to occur our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness 

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business 

several of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds danish krone and japanese yen sales by our operating companies whose functional currency is not the us dollar represented approximately 25 of our total net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 31 for the year ended december 31 2004 unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings at present we do not hedge against foreign currency risks 

we export a significant portion of our products difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business 

sales to customers outside the us by our businesses located in the us account for a significant portion of our net sales these sales accounted for approximately 16 and 19 of our net sales for the years ended december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively we are subject to risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign markets such risks include without limitation the following 

unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with us and other jurisdictions export requirements restrictions on the export of technology and related products unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with us and other jurisdictions export policies to certain countries unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets and a general economic downturn in our foreign markets the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our products and therefore could materially negatively affect our future sales and earnings 

economic political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business 

as of december 31 2005 approximately 16 of our longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles were attributable to operations outside the us we expect our international operations to continue to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future our international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the us including without limitation the following 

adverse changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions particularly in emerging markets trade protection measures and import or export requirements trade liberalization measures which could expose our international operations to increased competition subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations partial or total expropriation potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor regulations differing protection of intellectual property unexpected changes in regulatory requirements longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty in collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions and international sentiment towards the us the occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business 

our growth strategy includes acquisitions we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully 

our historical growth has depended and our future growth is likely to continue to depend to some degree on our ability to make acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquired businesses we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally there are no assurances however that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates negotiate appropriate acquisition terms obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms complete proposed acquisitions successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets once integrated acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction there are no assurances that we will properly ascertain all such risks in addition prior acquisitions have resulted and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities we cannot assure you that difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

product liability insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results 

our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacturing and distribution of our products in addition certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous environments we currently have product liability insurance however we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses we also maintain other insurance policies including directors and officers’ liability insurance our insurance costs increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future we believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies with respect to all product liability and other claims based upon our past experience and available facts however a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a significant increase in our insurance costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers 

we derive a significant amount of revenue from larger customers the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows additionally many of our customers are government entities government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency 

we face intense competition if we do not compete effectively our business may suffer 

we face intense competition from numerous competitors our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities with existing customers we may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors in addition new competitors may emerge and product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines to remain competitive we must develop new products respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely manner we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive 

changes in the supply of or price for parts and components used in our products could affect our business 

we purchase many parts and components from suppliers the availability and prices of parts and components are subject to curtailment or change due to among other things suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers interruptions in production by suppliers changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels some highperformance components for digital imaging products may be in short supply andor suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications in addition some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers any change in the supply of or price for these parts and components could affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition 

our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change 

we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we have experienced and expect to continue to experience costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of the industries in which we operate are cyclical and accordingly our business is subject to changes in the economy 

some of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles certain businesses are subject to industry cycles including but not limited to the industrial and semiconductor markets accordingly any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter the business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously consequently the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business 

our intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets and a writeoff of our intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization 

our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets primarily goodwill at december 31 2005 goodwill totaled approximately 135 billion compared to approximately 125 billion of stockholders’ equity which was approximately 54 of our total assets of approximately 252 billion the goodwill results from our acquisitions representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired we assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations become more conservative we could incur under current applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material 

we depend on our abilities to develop new products 

the future success of our business will depend in part on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins this product development may require substantial investment by us there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development performance or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new products failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our margins which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

because many of our products rely on proprietary technology we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our business despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful 

any business disruptions due to political instability armed hostilities incidents of terrorism or natural disasters couldadversely impact our financial performance 

if terrorist activity armed conflict political instability or natural disasters occur in the us or other locations such events may negatively impact our operations cause general economic conditions in the us and abroad to deteriorate or cause worldwide demand for us products to decline a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the us or in other areas of the world could reduce the demand for our products and therefore negatively affect our future sales and profits any of these events could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 

overview we are a diversified industrial company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging products and software industrial technology products instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and satellitebased communication technologies and related services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency rf applications water energy research and medical and other niche markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments on february 25 2005 we purchased inovonics a provider of 900 mhz radio frequency products primarily for security submetering and remote temperature monitoring applications on june 17 2005 we purchased civco a provider of diagnostic and therapeutic disposable products used in conjunction with ultrasound imaging for minimally invasive medical procedures primarily in urology radiology and cardiology on november 30 2005 we purchased medtec which designs develops and distributes enabling technologies essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment for cancer care medtec products include patient positioning devices imageguided therapy software and related products and accessories 

during the year ended december 31 2005 our results of operations benefited from the transcore acquisition made on december 13 2004 the power generation business of rd tech purchased on june 7 2004 and the partial year activities of inovonics civco and medtec 

in conjunction with the acquisition of transcore a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio frequency identification rfid satellitebased communication mobile asset tracking security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services we replaced our existing 625 million credit agreement completed a public offering of 5000000 shares of our common stock and entered into an amended and restated 1055 billion credit agreement an underwriters’ overallotment of 115000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on december 28 2004 

during the year ended december 31 2004 our results of operations benefited from the neptune technology group holdings inc “ntgh” acquisition made on december 29 2003 and the partial year activities of the power generation business of rd tech purchased on june 7 2004 

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 included elsewhere in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory utilization future warranty obligations revenue recognition percent of completion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2005 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 73 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was 13 million for a total of 86 million or 32 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables the timing of writeoffs of accounts deemed uncollectible and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the december 31 2004 level 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances at december 31 2005 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 243 million or 154 of gross firstin firstout inventory cost this percentage has decreased from 161 in the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 we expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time as we physically dispose of obsolete inventory 

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback at december 31 2005 the reserve for future warranty obligations was 66 million our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the years ended december 31 2005 december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the year ended december 31 2005 we recognized revenue of approximately 900 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term toll and traffic and energy projects approximately 168 million and 314 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively at december 31 2005 approximately 1000 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods we expected the significant increase in revenue related to the use of percentageofcompletion accounting in 2005 as transcore has several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method and we expect this higher level to continue in the future 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2005 our effective income tax rate was 306 which included a 66 million reduction of tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the internal revenue code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings in 2004 our effective income tax rate was 298 which included a 09 million additional rd credit we expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase to approximately 338 as the company does not expect a recurrence of 2005‘s reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings 

roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized amortization of intangible assets if applicable occurs over their estimated useful lives statement of financial accounting standard no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june 30 2001 and establishes a twostep method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value roper conducts this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year no impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2005 sfas 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized but separately tested for impairment using a onestep fair value based approach total goodwill includes 24 different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than 1 million to approximately 416 million 

results of operations general the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales 

     year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 were 145 billion as compared to sales of 9698 million for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 499 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth our 2005 results included a full year of sales from the power generation business of rd tech and from transcore both acquired during 2004 approximately ten months of sales from the inovonics acquisition six months from civco and one month from medtec net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 413 million of our 2005 net sales increase over 2004 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining 71 million of the increase 

in our instrumentation segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 increased by 192 million or 90 over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions increased sales of approximately 4 million in sulfur testing instruments as this testing moved from lab to process applications with our customers and increased sales of our nondestructive testing technology into new channels representing approximately 2 million 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 334 million or 84 for the year ended december 31 2005 over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions including strong sales growth in radio frequency technology in our water meter markets representing approximately 10 million and increased sales of standard products in our water and waste water pumps of approximately 5 million 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 increased by 184 million or 118 over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily due to the fullyear impact of the power generation business of rd tech acquired in 2004 of approximately 94 million 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 316 million or 168 for the year ended december 31 2005 over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was attributable to the partialyear impact of civco and medtec acquired in 2005 which accounted for approximately 22 million of the increase over prior year the remainder of the increase resulted primarily from new products and more focused selling activities driving market penetration in our physical and life sciences camera markets 

in our rf technology segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 increased by 3814 million over the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was attributable to the fullyear results of transcore purchased december 13 2004 and the ten month results of inovonics 

our overall gross profit percentage was 500 for the year ended december 31 2005 which remained the same as 500 for the year ended december 31 2004 the instrumentation segment gross margins increased to 585 as compared to 578 in the prior year the margins improved due to sales mix and leverage from increased sales industrial technology gross margins increased to 441 as compared to 426 in the prior year primarily due to the nonrecurrence of inventory stepup costs at neptune in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately 15 million our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were 547 in 2005 as compared to 523 in 2004 this was due to several factors none of which are easily quantifiable including a product rationalization effort in our nondestructive testing business better large project scope acceptance discipline and better engineering staff utilization in our oil and gas business our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 553 in 2005 as compared to 557 in 2004 this decrease is due totally to inventory stepup costs of approximately 21 million at civco and medtec incurred in 2005 without these charges there was a modest improvement in this segment’s gross margins for the year our rf technology segment gross margins were 464 in 2005 as compared to 404 for the 18 day period that transcore was owned in 2004 prior year gross margins were depressed due to the low sales volume in the holiday period of our ownership in the prior year 

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased to 318 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 from 324 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses 

interest expense increased 145 million or 504 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the transcore acquisition in december 2004 and borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the inovonics civco and medtec acquisitions in 2005 

the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2005 was a 39 million noncash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which are required to be classified as shortterm debt based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the company’s stock the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2004 was a 82 million noncash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs due to the amendment of our credit facility concurrent with the acquisition of transcore 

the change in other income for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 was primarily due to a 08 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of 07 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our imaging segment businesses 

during 2005 our effective income tax rate was 306 which included a 66 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the internal revenue code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings in 2004 our effective income tax rate was 298 which included a 09 million additional rd credit we expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase to approximately 338 as the company does not expect a recurrence of the 2005 reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings 

at december 31 2005 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were weaker and the functional currencies of our canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2004 the net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 279 million in the year period ending december 31 2005 approximately 218 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows for the entire year of 2005 operating profit was not affected by fluctuations in nonus currencies 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 dollar amounts in thousands 

 industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for neptune water meter and rf products which is also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of civco and medtec and also from stronger orders for industrial cameras and handheld computers which leads to the higher backlog at 2005 in the scientific and industrial imaging segment 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2005 and 2004 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 net sales for the year ended december 31 2004 were 9698 million as compared to sales of 6574 million for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 475 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth our 2004 results included a full year of sales from the ntgh acquisition six months of sales from the power generation business of rd tech and two weeks of sales from the transcore acquisition net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately 252 million of our 2004 net sales increase over 2003 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining 60 million of the increase 

in our instrumentation segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2004 increased by 324 million or 179 over the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was attributable to improved distribution new product introductions favorable market conditions and changes in exchange rates 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 2263 million or 1329 for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 over the twelve months ended december 31 2003 the increase primarily resulted from the ntgh acquisition accounting for approximately 206 million of the increase and also included stronger sales into industrial energy and commercial refrigeration end markets 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 increased by 173 million or 124 over the twelve months ended december 31 2003 the increase was due to the partialyear impact of the power generation business of rd tech acquired in 2004 of approximately 10 million as well as higher system and product sales of energy applications substantially offset by lower sales to gazprom 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 212 million or 127 for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 over the twelve months ended december 31 2003 approximately 20 million of the increase was attributable to the fullyear impact of ntgh acquired in 2003 

our rf technology segment was established in the fourth quarter of 2004 with the acquisition of transcore on december 13 2004 and includes two weeks of sales in 2004 

our overall gross profit percentage was 500 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 527 for the year ended december 31 2003 instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to 578 as compared to 583 in the prior year the margins were impacted by increased sales of third party sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin but good operating profit margins as expected industrial technology gross margins decreased to 426 as compared to 456 in the prior year because ntgh gross margins are lower than the segment average our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were 523 in 2004 as compared to 528 in 2003 this was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business offset by an increase in margins in our nondestructive testing business our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 557 in 2004 as compared to 536 in 2003 this increase is due to improved margins in our highperformance digital imaging cameras and electron microscopes much of which was achieved through the restructuring efforts undertaken in 2003 

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased to 324 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2004 from 362 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year this was offset with increased expenses related to compliance with the sarbanesoxley act 

interest expense increased 125 million or 761 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the ntgh acquisition in december 2003 

income taxes were 298 of pretax earnings in 2004 compared to 275 for 2003 our 2003 rate was low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing our 2004 rate also included an additional 09 million credit related to a rd study completed during the year 

at december 31 2004 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2003 this strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 273 million in the twelve month period ending december 31 2004 approximately 195 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows 2004 operating earnings benefited 19 from stronger nonus currencies foreign exchange differences related to our other nonus subsidiaries were immaterial to 2004 financial performance 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 dollar amounts in thousands 

 instrumentation segment net orders improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment in addition approximately 51 of the increase was due to the stronger european and asian currencies against the dollar industrial technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for neptune which were not included in the prior year energy systems and controls net orders rose due to strength in the nondestructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of rd tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year in addition there was continued strength in nongazprom oil and gas sectors offset by significantly lower gazprom orders scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2004 and 2003 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 the increase in backlog is due primarily to the inclusion of the transcore backlog of firm orders which can be shipped within twelve months 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was 2813 million for the year ended december 31 2005 1648 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 713 million for the year ended december 31 2003 2003 results include a 244 million writeoff of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the company the 2005 increase reflects stronger earnings from operations due to the inclusion of transcore inovonics civco  medtec in 2005 strong growth from our other operations and lower cash tax payments due primarily to the utilization of certain us net operating losses for tax purposes cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 were primarily business acquisition costs cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions and common stock issuances in 2004 and 2003 financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous 625 million credit agreement with our current 1055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity lower borrowing costs and improve other terms and conditions 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 2128 million at december 31 2005 compared to 2097 million at december 31 2004 we acquired approximately 217 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2005 

total debt was 8943 million at december 31 2005 417 of total capital compared to 8919 million at december 31 2004 444 of total capital our increased debt at december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 was due to borrowings related to our 2005 acquisitions 

our 1055 billion credit facility consists of a 655 million term loan and a 400 million revolving loan both with five year maturities at december 31 2005 our debt consisted of 230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 a balance of 6168 million on the term loan and a balance of 401 million on the revolving loan the company had 445 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2005 thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately we expect that our available borrowing capacity combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions we also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our nonus businesses in total these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 2005 

capital expenditures of 248 million 121 million and 104 million were incurred during 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in capital expenditures in 2005 was primarily due to the higher capital expenditure requirements of transcore acquired in december 2004 we expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be approximately comparable as a percentage of sales to 2005 

description of certain indebtedness senior secured credit facility 

concurrently with the closing of the transcore acquisition and the common stock offering in december 2004 we entered into a 1055 billion senior secured credit facility this credit facility consists of a fiveyear 655 million term loan and a fiveyear 400 million revolving loan 

our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and in certain cases reduce the commitments under the revolving loan upon the receipt of certain proceeds including from certain asset sales the incurrence of certain debt and up to 75 of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test we are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans 

the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt prepay subordinated debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio 

senior subordinated convertible notes 

in december 2003 we issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes is payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after that date we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable instead after january 15 2009 interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 375 and will represent accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 

the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 

as originally issued each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12422 shares of our common stock giving effect to the 2for1 stock split effective august 26 2005 and subject to further adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we would have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock on november 19 2004 the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes but would change how the conversion value is paid in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and at the company’s option any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december 6 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2009 january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after january 15 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date 

as of september 30 2005 the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on october 1 2005 based upon the company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive tradingday period ending on september 30 2005 

in accordance with eitf 048 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” the company is required to include in its diluted weightedaverage common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 3180 this is calculated using the treasury stock method 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies the following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2005 dollars in thousands 

 includes in 2006 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability however the company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next 12 months 

 at december 31 2005 the company had outstanding surety bonds of 1189 million 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2006 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

recently issued accounting standards in november 2004 the fasb issued fas 151 “inventory costsan amendment of arb no 43” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and material waste the standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current period charges fas 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fas 123r “sharebased payment” revised 2004 “sfas 123r” which was originally effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005 the effective date of this standard has been delayed until annual reporting periods beginning after december 31 2005 which was the company’s calendar year 2006 beginning on january 1 2006 sfas 123r applies to any unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date and to all new awards granted or modified after the effective date the remaining unrecognized portion of the original fair value of the unvested awards will be recognized in the income statement at their fair value that the company estimated for purposes of preparing its sfas 123 pro forma disclosures the company adopted sfas 123r on january 1 2006 and applied the modified prospective transition method this method requires the company to expense the remaining unrecognized portion of awards outstanding at the effective date and to expense any awards granted or modified after the effective date but does not require restatement of prior periods in accordance with fasb staff position fas 123r3 transition election to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards the company anticipates applying the shortcut method for determining its additional paidin capital pool however the company continues to evaluate such implementation as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r as of january 1 2006 the company estimates it will record expense of approximately 35 million in fiscal 2006 relating to its stockbased awards 

the fasb issued fsp 1091 and 1092 related to the american jobs creation act of 2004 fsp 1091 provides guidance related to the accounting for special tax deductions on “qualified production activities income” fsp 1092 provides companies with additional time to complete assessment of repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain repatriated foreign earnings as provided in the american jobs creation act of 2004 the fsps were effective upon issuance on december 21 2004 the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the company repatriated approximately 82 million of foreign sourced earnings during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately 66 million and is reflected in the company’s effective tax rate in the fourth quarter 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” “fin 47” to clarify the requirement to record liabilities stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event fin 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “sfas 154” “accounting changes and error corrections” sfas 154 requires that when a company changes its accounting policies it must apply the change retrospectively to all prior periods presented unless impracticable instead of a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of the change sfas 154 may also apply when the fasb issues new rules requiring changes in accounting however if the new rule allows cumulative effect treatment it would take precedence over sfas 154 this statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections beginning in the company’s calendar year 2006 which began on january 1 2006 

in june 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position 1431 accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations “fsp 1431” which provides guidance on the accounting for certain obligations associated with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the “directive” adopted by the european union “eu” under the directive the waste management obligation for historical equipment products put on the market on or prior to august 13 2005 remains with the commercial user until the customer replaces the equipment fsp 1431 is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after june 8 2005 or the date of the directive’s adoption into law by the applicable eu member countries in which the manufacturers have significant operations the company adopted fsp 1431 in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and its adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition for fiscal 2005 

information about forward looking statements this annual report includes and incorporates by reference “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws in addition we or our executive officers on our behalf may from time to time make forwardlooking statements in reports and other documents we file with the sec or in connection with oral statements made to the press potential investors or others all statements that are not historical facts are “forwardlooking statements” the words “estimate” “project” “intend” “expect” “believe” “anticipate” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position business financing plans business strategy business prospects revenues working capital liquidity capital needs interest costs and income in each case relating to our company as a whole as well as statements regarding acquisitions potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions 

forwardlooking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forwardlooking statements these statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions which in turn are based on currently available information examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions important assumptions relating to the forwardlooking statements include among others assumptions regarding demand for our products the cost timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions raw materials costs expected pricing levels the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures expected outcomes of pending litigation competitive conditions general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions joint ventures and alliances these assumptions could prove inaccurate although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable our expectations may prove to be incorrect important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forwardlooking statements include 

difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates difficulties associated with exports risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs risk of rising interest rates product liability and insurance risks increased warranty exposure future competition the cyclical nature of some of our markets reduction of business with large customers risks associated with government contracts changes in the supply of or price for parts and components environmental compliance costs and liabilities risks and costs associated with asbestosrelated litigation potential writeoffs of our substantial intangible assets our ability to successfully develop new products failure to protect our technology trade tariffs that may be applied due to the us governments delay in complying with certain wto directives terrorist attacks future health crises and the factors discussed in item 1a to this annual report under the heading risk factors we believe these forwardlooking statements are reasonable however you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements which are based on current expectations further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2005 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our 1055 billion senior credit facility contains 655 million variable rate term notes and a 400 million variable rate revolver to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases in 2005 the company entered into a 250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring march 13 2008 our 230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate at december 31 2005 the prevailing market rates were between 075 and 175 higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments 

at december 31 2005 roper’s outstanding variablerate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the 1055 billion credit facility were 4069 million an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 41 million 

several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros canadian dollars british pounds danish krone or japanese yen sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 25 of our total sales and 66 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar strengthened against european and asian currencies during 2005 and weakened against the canadian dollar the difference between 2005 operating results for these companies translated into us dollars during 2005 and these operating results translated into us dollars during 2005 was not material if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2005 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately 25 million 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during 2005 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2004 resulted in a decrease in net assets of 279 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 218 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements the stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

materials and suppliers we believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors thus far supply shortages have not had a significant adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we are required continually to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

competition generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation technology price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

patents and trademarks in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees to protect our trade secrets and knowhow while we believe that none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights the product development and market activities of compressor controls gatan neptune technology and roper scientific in particular have been planned and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent strategies our recent transcore acquisition has developed a portfolio of rfid and satellitebased communication products supported by over 100 patents while we have not significantly licensed patents trademarks trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from third parties in the past we may do so in the future 

employees as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 5600 total employees of whom approximately 4150 were located in the united states fewer than 50 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with employees to be good 










 item 2 properties roper’s corporate offices consisting of 13800 square feet of leased space are located near atlanta georgia we have established manufacturing sales and service locations around the world to support our operations the following table sets forth our principal properties as of december 31 2004 

 we consider each of the above facilities to be in good operating condition and adequate for its present use and believe that it has sufficient plant capacity to meet its current and anticipated operating requirements 




 item 3 legal proceedings we are defendants in various lawsuits involving product liability employment practices and other matters none of which we believe will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations the majority of such claims are subject to insurance coverage 

we andor one of our subsidiaries are named as defendants along with many other companies in asbestosrelated personal injury or wrongful death actions the allegations in these actions are vague general and speculative and the actions are in their early stages given the state of these claims it is not possible to determine the potential liability if any 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of securityholders there were no matters submitted to a vote of our securityholders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 

part ii 


 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities our common stock trades on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the symbol “rop” the table below sets forth the range of high and low sales prices for our common stock as reported by the nyse as well as cash dividends declared during each of our fiscal 2004 and 2003 quarters 

 based on information available to us and our transfer agent we believe that as of march 4 2005 there were 190 record holders of our common stock 

dividends roper has declared a cash dividend in each quarter since our february 1992 initial public offering and we have also annually increased our dividend rate since our initial public offering in november 2004 our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend paid january 31 2005 to 010625 per share from 009625 per share an increase of 10 however the timing declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our profitability financial condition capital needs future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 

recent sales of unregistered securities none 


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report in august 2003 we changed our fiscal yearend from october 31 to december 31 effective as of january 1 2003 with the two months ended december 31 2002 being the transition period 

overview we are a diversified industrial company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging products and software industrial technology products instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and satellitebased communication technologies and related services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency rf applications water and wastewater oil and gas research power generation general industry and 15 other niche markets 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both boltons and new strategic platforms we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments on june 7 2004 we purchased the power generation business of rd tech which was combined with our existing zetec business in the area of nondestructive evaluation on december 13 2004 we acquired transcore a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio frequency identification rfid satellitebased communication mobile asset tracking security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services in connection with this acquisition we replaced our existing 625 million credit agreement completed a public offering of 5000000 shares of our common stock and entered into an amended and restated 1055 billion credit agreement an underwriters’ overallotment of 115000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on december 28 2004 

during the year ended december 31 2004 our results of operations benefited from the ntgh acquisition made on december 29 2003 and the partial year activities of the power generation business of rd tech purchased on june 7 2004 

during the transition period ended december 31 2002 we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure this structure includes four marketfocused groups intended to capture valuecreating opportunities around common customers market orientation sales channels technologies and common cost opportunities 

following the segment realignment we started a number of restructuring activities that were completed in the first quarter of 2004 during 2003 we completed the integration of our acton research and integrated design business units the integration of ai qualitek into the uson business unit the integration of production operations of our redlake business unit into other imaging segment facilities and the relocation of struers manufacturing engineering and administrative support into a new facility in 2003 we also opened new production facilities in mexico and china during 2004 we moved the us production operations of the amot controls business unit to other facilities and completed a restructuring of the compressor controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of oao gazprom business all of these actions were planned to lower costs and enhance profit margins 

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 included elsewhere in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements except for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as discussed below 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory utilization future warranty obligations revenue recognition percent of completion income taxes and goodwill and indefinitelived asset analyses these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2004 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sales returns and sales credits was 78 million or 31 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the december 31 2003 level 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances at december 31 2004 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 256 million or 161 of gross firstin firstout inventory cost this percentage has decreased from 180 in the fiscal year ended december 31 2003 we expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time 

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback at december 31 2004 the reserve for future warranty obligations was 64 million our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended december 31 2004 december 31 2003 and october 31 2002 

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the twelve month period ended december 31 2004 we recognized revenue of approximately 168 million using this method primarily for major turnkey longer term energy projects no material amount of revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended december 31 2002 approximately 314 million and 24 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the twelve months ended december 31 2003 and october 31 2002 respectively at december 31 2004 approximately 583 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods we expect a significant increase in revenue related to the use of percentageofcompletion accounting in 2005 as transcore has several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during 2004 our effective income tax rate was 298 which included a 09 million additional rd credit as compared to 275 for 2003 our 2003 rate was abnormally low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings we expect our tax rate in 2005 to increase to approximately 325 due primarily to transcore’s higher effective rate 

we adopted sfas no 142 effective november 1 2001 – the beginning of our fiscal year ended october 31 2002 the evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets under sfas 142 requires valuations of each applicable underlying business these valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets these estimates will likely change over time some of our businesses operate in somewhat cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality the transitional business valuation reviews required by sfas 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units redlake petrotech and dynamco this goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended october 31 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately 26 million sfas 142 requires goodwill to be evaluated annually if this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations our annual reviews undertaken during 2004 and 2003 did not indicate that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions 

prior to adopting sfas 142 goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years with the adoption of this standard goodwill is not amortized it is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above we are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment 

results of operations general the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales 

  year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 net sales for the year ended december 31 2004 were 9698 million as compared to sales of 6574 million for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 475 this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth our 2004 results included a full year of sales from the ntgh acquisition six months of sales from the power generation business of rd tech and two weeks of sales from the transcore acquisition 

in our instrumentation segment net sales for the year ended december 31 2004 increased by 324 million or 179 over the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was attributable to improved distribution new product introductions favorable market conditions and changes in exchange rates 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 2263 million or 1329 for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 over the twelve months ended december 31 2003 the increase primarily resulted from the ntgh acquisition and also included stronger sales into industrial energy and commercial refrigeration end markets 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 increased by 173 million or 124 over the twelve months ended december 31 2003 the increase was due to the partialyear impact of the power generation business of rd tech acquired in 2004 as well as higher system and product sales of energy applications substantially offset by lower sales to gazprom 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 212 million or 127 for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 over the twelve months ended december 31 2003 the increase was attributable to the fullyear impact of ntgh acquired in 2003 

our rf technology segment was established in the fourth quarter of 2004 with the acquisition of transcore on december 13 2004 and includes two weeks of sales in 2004 

our overall gross profit percentage was 500 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to 527 for the year ended december 31 2003 instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to 578 as compared to 583 in the prior year the margins were impacted by increased sales of third party sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin but good operating profit margins as expected industrial technology gross margins decreased to 426 as compared to 456 in the prior year because ntgh gross margins are lower than the segment average our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were 523 in 2004 as compared to 528 in 2003 this was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business offset by an increase in margins in our nondestructive testing business our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 557 in 2004 as compared to 536 in 2003 this increase is due to improved margins in our highperformance digital imaging cameras and electron microscopes much of which was achieved through the restructuring efforts undertaken in 2003 

selling general and administrative sga expenses decreased to 324 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2004 from 362 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year this was offset with increased expenses related to compliance with the sarbanesoxley act 

interest expense increased 125 million or 761 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the ntgh acquisition in december 2003 

income taxes were 298 of pretax earnings in 2004 compared to 275 for 2003 our 2003 rate was low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing our 2004 rate also included an additional 09 million credit related to a rd study completed during the year we expect our tax rate in 2005 to increase to approximately 325 due primarily to transcore’s higher effective rate 

at december 31 2004 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2003 this strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 273 million in the twelve month period ending december 31 2004 approximately 195 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows 2004 operating earnings benefited 19 from stronger nonus currencies foreign exchange differences related to our other nonus subsidiaries were immaterial to 2004 financial performance 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 dollar amounts in thousands 

 instrumentation segment net orders improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment in addition approximately 51 of the increase was due to the stronger european and asian currencies against the dollar industrial technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for neptune which were not included in the prior year energy systems and controls net orders rose due to strength in the nondestructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of rd tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year in addition there was continued strength in nongazprom oil and gas sectors offset by significantly lower gazprom orders scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2004 and 2003 dollar amounts in thousands roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 

 the increase in backlog is due primarily to the inclusion of the transcore backlog of firm orders which can be shipped within twelve months 

year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended october 31 2002 net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 were 6574 million as compared to sales of 6175 million for the twelve months ended october 31 2002 an increase of 65 a significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal 2002 acquisitions zetec ai qualitek and qimaging we had a significant decrease in sales to gazprom 337 million or 597 decline from the prior period as a result of the change in their procurement processes this significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and consumables imaging sales into electron microscopy markets waterwastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales 

in our instrumentation segment net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 increased by 58 million or 33 over the twelve months ended october 31 2002 the increase was attributable to the fullyear impact of ai qualitek acquired in fiscal 2002 and strong results from our europeanbased struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 62 million or 38 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 over the twelve months ended october 31 2002 the increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger municipal waterwastewater projects 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 increased by 123 million or 97 over the twelve months ended october 31 2002 the increase was due to the fullyear impact of zetec acquired in fiscal 2002 offset by the expected lower sales levels to gazprom we also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 156 million or 103 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 over the twelve months ended october 31 2002 the increase was attributable to both the fullyear impact of qimaging acquired in fiscal 2002 and the increased sales for electron microscopy products 

our overall gross profit percentage was 527 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 as compared to 541 for the twelve months ended october 31 2002 instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat period over period at 583 as compared to 586 industrial technology gross margins decreased to 456 due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls business that was addressed by moving production to lower cost environments our energy systems and controls segment reported margins of 528 in fiscal 2003 as compared to 598 in fiscal 2002 a decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of zetec whose gross margins are lower than the segment average additionally there were lower margins from the significantly lower levels of gazprom sales in this segment in the current period our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 536 in fiscal 2003 as compared to 523 in fiscal 2002 as we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product 

selling general and administrative sga expenses increased to 362 of net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 from 352 of net sales for the twelve months ended october 31 2002 primarily from 59 million of restructuring expenses 09 of net sales incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity move certain operations to lowercost locations and reduce fixed costs 

interest expense decreased 21 million or 115 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 compared to the twelve months ended october 31 2002 as a result of lower debt levels in the current period the company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels prior to the ntgh transaction 

income taxes were 275 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to 31 in fiscal 2002 the primary factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings 

at december 31 2003 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both october 31 2002 and december 31 2002 this strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 68 million in the two month period ending december 31 2002 and of 363 million in the twelve month period ending december 31 2003 approximately 336 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows fiscal 2003 operating results also benefited from the stronger nonus currencies the net benefits were approximately 2 of operating earnings foreign exchange differences related to our other nonus subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2003 financial performance 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2003 and october 31 2002 dollar amounts in thousands 

 instrumentation segment net orders improved due to the full year bookings of ai qualitek continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment industrial technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft fiscal 2002 energy systems and controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of zetec orders and strength in nongazprom oil and gas sectors offset by significantly lower gazprom orders scientific and industrial imaging net orders benefited from the full year of qimaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products sales increased in the period and weaker research market demand for highend digital cameras 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2003 and october 31 2002 dollar amounts in thousands 

 the increase in backlog was primarily due to the inclusion of the ntgh entities at december 31 2003 the decline in the instrumentation backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications business 

two months ended december 31 2002 compared to two months ended december 31 2001 net sales for the two month period ended december 31 2002 were 839 million as compared to 869 million in the two month period ended december 31 2001 this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the scientific and industrial imaging segment partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions 

in our instrumentation segment net sales decreased by 72 as compared to the prioryear period primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for our logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semiconductor market elsewhere softness in oil  gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the ai qualitek acquisition gross margins moved from 617 in the prior year period to 577 in the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our logitech unit and semiconductor businesses sga expenses as a percentage of sales were 24 higher at 418 due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures overall the segment reported operating profit margins of 159 as compared to 223 in the prioryear period 

in our industrial technology segment net sales were comparable to the same period in 2001 gross margins decreased to 439 in the period from 450 in the prioryear however sga expenses as a percentage of sales were 11 lower at 295 offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain constant at 144 the lower sga expense level is primarily the result of headcount reductions 

net sales in our energy systems  controls segment increased by 195 during the two months ended december 31 2002 as sales contributed by zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to gazprom gross margins decreased from 407 to 387 as a result of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season this adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales from 480 in the prioryear period to 599 in the current year period as a result operating losses increased from 73 in the prioryear period to 212 management does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future 

our scientific  industrial imaging segment net sales decreased by 120 due primarily to the absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the contributions from the qimaging and definitive imaging acquisitions gross margins decreased from 513 in 2002 to 506 due to the increased manufacturing costs in the period for tem imaging equipment sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 450 in the period from 356 in the prioryear period as a result of additional costs associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated with foreign sales subsidiaries overall the segment reported operating profits margins of 56 as compared to 157 with the bulk of the decline attributable to the repositioning of our motion imaging business 

corporate expenses decreased by 10 million and reduced as a percentage of sales from 29 to 19 due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs 

interest expense held constant at 29 million for the two month period ended december 31 2002 compared to the two month period ended december 31 2001 as lower effective interest rates offset increased borrowing levels 

other income was 02 million in the two month period ended december 31 2002 as compared to 07 million in the equivalent prioryear period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains 

income taxes were 300 of pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to 350 in the equivalent prioryear period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available foreign income tax credits 

at december 31 2002 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at october 31 2002 and december 31 2001 this strengthening resulted in a gain of 68 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended december 31 2002 approximately 54 million of the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of the us dollar primarily against the euro the difference between the operating results for these companies for the two month period ending december 31 2002 translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two month period and these operating results translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in 2001 was not material if the impact of selling european sourced product in the us is also considered the impact of currency movements was negligible 

net orders booked for continuing operations were 953 million for the period 8 higher than the same period of 2001 net order intake of 880 million this increase was due to the additional net orders booked of 106 million from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our industrial technology segment overall our order backlog at december 31 2002 increased by 66 million as compared to december 31 2001 this increase was due to new acquisitions having 69 million in backlog at december 31 2002 partially offset by softness in the industrial technology segment 

 financial condition liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was 1648 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 713 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 and 868 million for the twelve months ended october 31 2002 2003 results include a 244 million writeoff of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the company the increase in 2004 over 2003 reflected stronger earnings from operations due to the inclusion of ntgh in 2004 strong internal growth the nonrecurrence of debt extinguishment cash cost and low cash tax payments due to the utilization of certain domestic net operating losses for tax purposes cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 were primarily business acquisition costs cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous 625 million credit agreement with our current 1055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity lower borrowing costs and improve other terms and conditions 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 2097 million at december 31 2004 compared to 1704 million at december 31 2003 we acquired approximately 532 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2004 

total debt was 8919 million at december 31 2004 444 of total capital compared to 6511 million at december 31 2003 498 of total capital our increased debt at december 31 2004 compared to december 31 2003 was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current year to fund the transcore acquisition and replace the previous credit facility 

our 1055 billion credit facility consists of a 655 million term loan and a 400 million revolving loan both with five year maturities at december 31 2004 our debt consisted of 230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 and the 655 million term loan the company had 473 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2004 45 million of the letters of credit were issued via the revolving loan thereby reducing its remaining capacity to 355 million we expect that our available borrowing capacity combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions we also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our nonus businesses in total these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 2004 

capital expenditures of 121 million 104 million and 77 million were incurred during 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we expect capital expenditures in 2005 to be slightly higher due to the higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired transcore business 

description of certain indebtedness senior secured credit facility 

concurrently with the closing of the transcore acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in december 2004 we entered into a 1055 billion senior secured credit facility this credit facility consists of a fiveyear 655 million term loan and a fiveyear 400 million revolving loan 

our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and in certain cases reduce the commitments under the revolving loan upon the receipt of certain proceeds including from certain asset sales the incurrence of certain debt and up to 75 of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test we are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt prepay subordinated debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio 

senior subordinated convertible notes 

in december 2003 we issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes is payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after that date we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable instead after january 15 2009 interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 375 and will represent accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 

the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 

as originally issued each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 6211 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we will have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock on november 19 2004 the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes but would change how the conversion value is paid in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and at the company’s option any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december 6 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2009 january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after january 15 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies the following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2004 dollars in thousands 

  at december 31 2004 and 2003 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2005 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

recently issued accounting standards in january 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1061 “fsp 1061” “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” which provides temporary guidance concerning the recently enacted medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” requires presently enacted changes in laws that will take effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring current period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit obligation the implementation of fsp 1061 had no material impact on the company

the eitf reached final consensus on eitf 048 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” which would require convertible debt with a market price contingency to be included in diluted eps calculations the consensus should be applied to reporting periods ending after december 15 2004 during december 2004 management completed a consent solicitation to modify the conversion provisions on the company’s convertible notes with the effect that they will not be required to be included in diluted eps calculations pursuant to eitf 048

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2004 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings our 1055 billion senior credit facility contains 655 million variable rate term notes and a 400 million variable rate revolver to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases the company entered into fixed rate swap agreements including a 100 million agreement expiring january 6 2006 and subsequent to year end a 250 million agreement expiring march 13 2008 our 230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate at december 31 2004 there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments 

at december 31 2004 roper’s outstanding variablerate borrowings under the 1055 billion credit facility were 555 million an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 56 million before accounting for the 250 million fixed rate swap agreement which we entered into subsequent to year end 

several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros british pounds danish krone or japanese yen sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 36 of our total sales and 77 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar weakened against these european currencies during 2004 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies the difference between 2004 operating results for these companies translated into us dollars during 2004 and these operating results translated into us dollars during 2003 was not material if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout 2004 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately 29 million 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during 2004 compared to currency exchange rates at december 31 2003 resulted in an increase in net assets of 273 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 195 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

  backlog our scientific and industrial imaging segment companies typically have lead times of up to several months on many of their product sales although standard products are often shipped within two weeks of receipt of order blanket purchase orders are placed by certain oems and endusers with continuing requirements for fulfillment over specified periods of time the segment’s backlog of firm unfilled orders including blanket purchase orders totaled 425 million at december 31 2003 as compared to 470 million at december 31 2002 within the december 2003 backlog 55 million is attributable to handheld computer and software backlog associated with the ntgh acquisition 

  distribution and sales distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel manufacturers’ representatives value added resellers or vars oems and distributors 

  customers no customer was responsible for as much as 10 of this segment’s net sales for 2003 one of the scientific and industrial imaging segment’s operating units has sales to a few customers that represent a significant portion of that operating unit’s sales and the relative importance of such a concentrated customer base for this operating unit is expected to continue 

materials and suppliers we believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world however some of our components and subassemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors thus far supply shortages have not had a significant adverse effect on roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions in the past dap technologies has incurred lost orders or shipment delays due to the inability of its vars to design and install applicationspecific software on a timely basis 

environmental matters and other governmental regulation our operations and properties and those recently acquired from ntgh are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace safety we use generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury we are required continually to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change we have experienced and expect to continue to experience modest costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws and regulations in connection with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some of which we may not be aware of or may not be quantifiable at the time of acquisition in addition new laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities 

competition generally our products and solutions face significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors although we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product quality performance innovation price applications expertise distribution channel access and customer service capabilities 

patents and trademarks in addition to trade secrets unpatented knowhow and other intellectual property rights we own the rights under a number of patents trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses we also employ various methods including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees to protect our trade secrets and knowhow while we believe that none of our operating units is substantially dependent on any single patent trademark copyright or other item of intellectual property or group of patents trademarks or copyrights the product development and market activities of compressor controls gatan neptune technology and roper scientific in particular have been planned and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent strategies while we have not significantly licensed patents trademarks trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from third parties in the past we may do so in the future 

employees as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 3700 total employees of whom approximately 2440 were located in the united states fewer than 80 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with employees to be good 










 item 2 properties in early january 2003 we relocated our corporate office from bogart georgia where we leased approximately 10000 square feet of office space to the atlanta area where we lease approximately 13800 square feet of office space we have established sales and service locations around the world to support our operations the following table sets forth our principal properties as of december 31 2003 

 we consider each of the above facilities to be in good operating condition and adequate for its present use and believe that it has sufficient plant capacity to meet its current and anticipated operating requirements 




 item 3 legal proceedings we are defendants in various lawsuits involving product liability employment practices and other matters none of which we believe will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations the majority of such claims are subject to insurance coverage 

we andor one of our subsidiaries are named as defendants along with many other companies in asbestosrelated personal injury or wrongful death actions the allegations in these actions are vague general and speculative and the actions are in their early stages given the state of these claims it is not possible to determine the potential liability if any 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of securityholders no matter was submitted to a vote of our securityholders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 

part ii 


 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities roper’s common stock trades on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the symbol “rop” the table below sets forth the range of high and low sales prices for our common stock as reported by the nyse as well as cash dividends declared during each of our fiscal 2003 and 2002 quarters 

 based on information available to us and our transfer agent we believe that as of march 1 2004 there were 194 record holders of our common stock 

dividends roper has declared a cash dividend in each fiscal quarter since our february 1992 initial public offering and we have also annually increased our dividend rate since our initial public offering in november 2003 our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 to 009625 per share an increase of 10 from the prior rate however the timing declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our profitability financial condition capital needs future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore there can be no assurance as to the amount if any of cash dividends that will be declared in the future 

recent sales of unregistered securities none 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with “selected financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report in august 2003 we changed our fiscal yearend from october 31 to december 31 effective as of january 1 2003 with the two months ended december 31 2002 being the transition period 

we filed an amendment to our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended october 31 2002 on november 3 2003 to restate our consolidated financial statements as of october 31 2001 and 2002 and for the three years ended october 31 2002 to reflect the discontinued operations of our petrotech operation and the realignment of our operations into four new segments 

overview we are a diversified industrial company that designs manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls scientific and industrial imaging products and software industrial technology products and instrumentation products and services we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including water and wastewater oil and gas research power generation medical semiconductor refrigeration automotive and general industry 

we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses our acquisitions have represented both financial boltons and new strategic platforms we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments on december 29 2003 we acquired ntgh comprising neptune technology a leader in the meter management market dap technologies a leading fully rugged computer provider and db microware providing various software products for utility markets as these businesses were closed for the yearend holiday period following the acquisition there are no operating results attributable to these operations in our fiscal 2003 results however the assets and liabilities of the operations are consolidated in our balance sheet as of december 31 2003 in connection with this acquisition we retired our existing debt completed a public offering of 4200000 shares of our common stock entered into a new 625 million credit agreement and issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes an underwriters’ overallotment of 630000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed in january 2004 

during the fiscal year ended december 31 2003 our results of operations benefited from five acquisitions made during the last six months of the fiscal year 2002 

1 zetec reported in our energy systems and controls segment 2 ai qualitek reported in our instrumentation segment 3 qimaging reported in our scientific and industrial imaging segment 4 duncan technologies reported in our scientific and industrial imaging segment 5 definitive imaging reported in our scientific and industrial imaging segment 

our largest customer is oao gazprom gazprom has been a customer over the past eleven years through a number of its procurement affiliates in late 2002 gazprom assigned a new procurement affiliate to negotiate with us and during the second calendar quarter of 2003 we secured a new supply agreement orders received under this agreement have been received on a delayed basis and at lower levels than initially indicated by the procurement affiliate and consequently have resulted in lower activity levels than in comparative prior year periods new orders received under this agreement during the year ended december 31 2003 totaled 252 million or 39 of total new orders net sales to gazprom were 228 million during the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 565 million during the year ended october 31 2002 

during the transition period ended december 31 2002 we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure this structure has realigned our operations into four marketfocused groups to capture valuecreating opportunities around common customers market orientation sales channels and common cost opportunities having recruited and reassigned new managers to lead these realigned groups in the first quarter we commenced cascading leadership through these segments with the hiring of several key managers from established growth companies to provide enhanced functional and business expertise 

following the segment realignment we started a number of restructuring activities we have completed the integration of our acton research and integrated design business units the integration of ai qualitek into the uson business unit and the integration of production operations of our redlake business unit into other imaging segment facilities in addition we have opened a new production facility in mexico as a result of which we closed the us production operations of the dynamco business unit and commenced the movement of manufacturing of certain other industrial technology product lines into this facility we opened a new production facility in china to better serve customers in that growing market during the third quarter we completed our relocation of struers manufacturing engineering and administrative support activities into a new facility final actions to be completed in the first half of 2004 include the move of the us production operations of the amot controls business unit to other facilities and a restructuring of the compressor controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of gazprom business all of these actions are planned to lower costs and enhance margins 

in february 2003 we launched a new motion imaging product line in our scientific and industrial imaging segment extensive development of this product line commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 and was completed during february 2003 during the development period our customers deferred ordering our existing products in anticipation of significant benefits from our new technology cameras and systems 

the weakening of the us dollar during fiscal 2003 particularly against the euro the danish krone and the british pound had a mixed impact on our reported results without the currency changes reported net sales and net orders would have been reduced by 262 million and 256 million respectively as compared to the prior calendar year however the potentially favorable effects on profits from these currency translation efforts were substantially offset by the impact of selling products in the us that we produced in countries with now increased eurodenominated costs 

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2003 included elsewhere in this annual report 

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost depreciating longlived assets recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements except for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as discussed below 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects are accounted for prospectively 

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility inventory utilization future warranty obligations revenue recognition percent of completion income taxes and goodwill analysis these issues except for income taxes which are not allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting 

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits at december 31 2003 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sales returns and sales credits was 45 million or 3 of total gross accounts receivable this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and has remained constant as a percent of sales as compared to the october 31 2002 levels and the transition period ended december 31 2002 

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances at december 31 2003 inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 236 million or 18 of gross firstin firstout inventory cost this percentage has remained constant with both the fiscal year ended october 31 2002 and the transition period ended december 31 2002 

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product evolution and customer feedback at december 31 2003 the accrual for future warranty obligations was 50 million or 06 of annualized fourth quarter fiscal 2003 sales this calculation is based upon both roper’s and ntgh’s annualized fourth quarter 2003 sales the warranty reserve for the ntgh entities is at a similar level to the existing roper entities our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended december 31 2003 october 31 2002 and october 31 2001 

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project during the twelve month period ended december 31 2003 we recognized revenue of approximately 314 million using this method due primarily to two of our businesses carrying out major energy and waterwastewater projects of a turnkey longer term nature no material amount of revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended december 31 2002 approximately 24 million and 23 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the twelve months ended october 31 2002 and 2001 respectively at december 31 2003 approximately 126 million of revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be recognized contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner during fiscal 2003 our effective income tax rate was reduced to 275 as compared to 30 for the two month period ended december 31 2002 and 31 for the twelve month period ended october 31 2002 the primary reasons for the decline for the current fiscal year are the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings we are not expecting to incur in 2004 the onetime costs that created this abnormally low tax rate 

we adopted sfas no 142 effective november 1 2001  the beginning of our fiscal year ended october 31 2002 the evaluation of goodwill under sfas 142 requires valuations of each applicable underlying business these valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets these estimates will likely change over time some of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality the transitional business valuation reviews required by sfas 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units redlake petrotech and dynamco this goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended october 31 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately 26 million sfas 142 requires goodwill to be evaluated annually if this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations our annual reviews undertaken during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 did not indicate that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions 

prior to adopting sfas 142 goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years with the adoption of this standard goodwill is not amortized it is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above sfas 142 does not permit retroactive application to years prior to adoption therefore earnings beginning in fiscal 2002 tend to be higher than earlier periods as a result of this accounting change except for the effects of any impairment provision on current results note 5 to our consolidated financial statements includes a reconciliation comparing earnings of preadoption periods to earnings of current periods for those periods presented goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of sfas 142 was largest in the instrumentation segment we are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment 

at december 31 2003 roper’s total assets included 7112 million of goodwill goodwill was allocated 2240 million to our instrumentation segment 2828 million to our industrial technology segment 815 million to our energy systems and controls segment and 1229 million to our scientific and industrial imaging segment total goodwill was allocated to 25 different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than 1 million to approximately 202 million 

results of operations general the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales 

 1 includes results of struers and logitech from september 2001 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented 2 includes results of zetec from august 2002 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented 3 restructuring charges were 180000 279000 and 50000 in industrial technology instrumentation and scientific and industrial imaging respectively restructuring charges in fiscal 2003 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in compliance with sfas 146 are included as a reduction of operating profits in the respective segments 

year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended october 31 2002 net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 were 6574 million as compared to sales of 6175 million for the twelve months ended october 31 2002 an increase of 65 a significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal 2002 acquisitions zetec ai qualitek and qimaging we had a significant decrease in sales to gazprom 337 million or 597 decline from the prior period as a result of the change in their procurement processes noted previously this significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and consumables imaging sales into electron microscopy markets waterwastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales 

in our instrumentation segment net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 increased by 58 million or 33 over the twelve months ended october 31 2002 the increase was attributable to the fullyear impact of ai qualitek acquired in fiscal 2002 and strong results from our europeanbased struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets 

net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by 62 million or 38 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 over the twelve months ended october 31 2002 the increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger municipal waterwastewater projects 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 increased by 123 million or 97 over the twelve months ended october 31 2002 the increase was due to the fullyear impact of zetec acquired in fiscal 2002 offset by the expected lower sales levels to gazprom we also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of 156 million or 103 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 over the twelve months ended october 31 2002 the increase was attributable to both the fullyear impact of qimaging acquired in fiscal 2002 and the increased sales for electron microscopy products 

our overall gross profit percentage was 527 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 as compared to 541 for the twelve months ended october 31 2002 instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat period over period at 583 as compared to 586 industrial technology gross margins decreased to 456 due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls business that is being addressed by moving production to lower cost environments our energy systems and controls segment reported margins of 528 in fiscal 2003 as compared to 598 in fiscal 2002 a decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of zetec whose gross margins are lower than the segment average additionally there were lower margins from the significantly lower levels of gazprom sales in this segment in the current period our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were 536 in fiscal 2003 as compared to 523 in fiscal 2002 as we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product 

selling general and administrative sga expenses increased to 362 of net sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 from 352 of net sales for the twelve months ended october 31 2002 primarily from 59 million of restructuring expenses 09 of net sales incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity move certain operations to lowercost locations and reduce fixed costs 

interest expense decreased 21 million or 115 for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 compared to the twelve months ended october 31 2002 as a result of lower debt levels in the current period the company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels prior to the ntgh transaction 

income taxes were 275 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to 31 in fiscal 2002 the primary factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings 

at december 31 2003 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both october 31 2002 and december 31 2002 this strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of 68 million in the two month period ending december 31 2002 and of 363 million in the twelve month period ending december 31 2003 approximately 336 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows fiscal 2003 operating results also benefited from the stronger nonus currencies the net benefits were approximately 2 of operating earnings foreign exchange differences related to our other nonus subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2003 financial performance 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december 31 2003 and october 31 2002 dollar amounts in thousands 

 instrumentation segment net orders improved due to the full year bookings of ai qualitek continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment industrial technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft fiscal 2002 energy systems and controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of zetec orders and strength in nongazprom oil and gas sectors offset by significantly lower gazprom orders scientific and industrial imaging net orders benefited from the full year of qimaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products sales increased in the period and weaker research market demand for highend digital cameras 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december 31 2003 and october 31 2002 dollar amounts in thousands 

 the increase in backlog was primarily due to the inclusion of the ntgh entities at december 31 2003 the decline in the instrumentation segment backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications business 

two months ended december 31 2002 compared to two months ended december 31 2001 net sales for the two month period ended december 31 2002 were 839 million as compared to 869 million in the two month period ended december 31 2001 this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the scientific and industrial imaging segment partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions 

in our instrumentation segment net sales decreased by 72 as compared to the prioryear period primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for our logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semiconductor market elsewhere softness in oil  gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the ai qualitek acquisition gross margins moved from 617 in the prior year period to 577 in the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our logitech unit and semiconductor businesses sga expenses as a percentage of sales were 24 higher at 418 due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures overall the segment reported operating profit margins of 159 as compared to 223 in the prioryear period 

in our industrial technology segment net sales were comparable to the same period in 2001 gross margins decreased to 439 in the period from 450 in the prioryear however sga expenses as a percentage of sales were 11 lower at 295 offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain constant at 144 the lower sga expense level is primarily the result of headcount reductions 

net sales in our energy systems  controls segment increased by 195 during the two months ended december 31 2002 as sales contributed by zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to gazprom gross margins decreased from 407 to 387 as a result of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season this adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in sga expenses as a percentage of sales from 480 in the prioryear period to 599 in the current year period as a result operating losses increased from 73 in the prioryear period to 212 management does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future 

our scientific  industrial imaging segment net sales decreased by 120 due primarily to the absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the contributions from the qimaging and definitive imaging acquisitions gross margins decreased from 513 in 2002 to 506 due to the increased manufacturing costs in the period for tem imaging equipment sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 450 in the period from 356 in the prioryear period as a result of additional costs associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated with foreign sales subsidiaries overall the segment reported operating profits margins of 56 as compared to 157 with the bulk of the decline attributable to the repositioning of our motion imaging business 

corporate expenses decreased by 10 million and reduced as a percentage of sales from 29 to 19 due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs 

interest expense held constant at 29 million for the two month period ended december 31 2002 compared to the two month period ended december 31 2001 as lower effective interest rates offset increased borrowing levels 

other income was 02 million in the two month period ended december 31 2002 as compared to 07 million in the equivalent prioryear period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains 

income taxes were 300 of pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to 350 in the equivalent prioryear period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available foreign income tax credits 

at december 31 2002 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at october 31 2002 and december 31 2001 this strengthening resulted in a gain of 68 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended december 31 2002 approximately 54 million of the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of the us dollar primarily against the euro the difference between the operating results for these companies for the two month period ending december 31 2002 translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two month period and these operating results translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in 2001 was not material if the impact of selling european sourced product in the us is also considered the impact of currency movements was negligible 

net orders booked for continuing operations were 953 million for the period 8 higher than the same period of 2001 net order intake of 880 million this increase was due to the additional net orders booked of 106 million from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our industrial technology segment overall our order backlog at december 31 2002 increased by 66 million as compared to december 31 2001 this increase was due to new acquisitions having 69 million in backlog at december 31 2002 partially offset by softness in the industrial technology segment 

 year ended october 31 2002 compared to year ended october 31 2001 net sales for fiscal 2002 were 6175 million as compared to sales of 5630 million in fiscal 2001 an increase of 97 878 million of the sales increase was attributable to acquisitions during fiscal 2002 zetec qimaging duncan technologies definitive imaging and ai qualitek and the fullyear impact of acquisitions made during fiscal 2001 struers logitech media cybernetics and dynamco excluding this impact net sales declined by 27 to 5297 million primarily attributable to declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and gas exploration and certain industrial markets the impact of these difficult market conditions was somewhat mitigated by a 15 increase in sales to gazprom and an 8 increase in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their products help customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding sulfur content in petroleum products 

in our instrumentation segment fiscal 2002 net sales increased by 501 million or 40 over fiscal 2001 the increase was primarily attributable to a yearonyear sales increase of 646 million from acquisitions ai qualitek acquired in fiscal 2002 and the fullyear impact of our fiscal 2001 acquisitions struers and logitech excluding this impact of acquisitions net sales declined 06 to 1109 million as a result of severely depressed business conditions in semiconductor markets 

net sales for our industrial technology segment declined by 67 million or 39 from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 primarily from weakness in industrial pump and oil  gas exploration markets the fullyear impact of the fiscal 2001 acquisition of dynamco slightly mitigated this decrease 

in our energy systems and controls segment net sales increased by 197 million or 184 with 131 million of the increase being attributable to the fiscal 2002 acquisition of zetec excluding the impact of zetec net sales increased 61 to 1136 million due to gains in sales of oil  gas control system applications including those sold to gazprom 

our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported a decrease in net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 of 86 million or 54 the decrease resulted principally from lower motion product sales due to the pending release of a new generation of products that began shipping during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 fiscal 2002 acquisitions qimaging definitive imaging and duncan technologies and the fullyear increase of a fiscal 2001 acquisition media cybernetics mitigated the decline by 88 million excluding the impact of these acquisitions net sales declined by 111 to 1392 million 

our overall gross profit percentage was 541 in fiscal 2002 and the same as in fiscal 2001 instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat in fiscal 2002 at 586 as compared to 584 in fiscal 2001 industrial technology gross margins decreased to 462 in fiscal 2002 as compared to 468 in fiscal 2001 as a result of adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps businesses our energy systems and controls segment reported margins of 598 in fiscal 2002 as compared to 628 in fiscal 2001 attributable to lower gross margins at zetec as compared to the segment average our scientific and industrial imaging segments gross margins were 523 in fiscal 2002 as compared to 528 in fiscal 2001 as margins declined for motion imaging equipment with the significant reduction in sales 

excluding the effects from the accounting changes related to goodwill and the related amortization charges expensed in fiscal 2001 of 153 million selling general  administrative “sga” expenses increased to 352 of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 335 of net sales in fiscal 2001 this increase is attributable to higher sga expense levels at newly acquired businesses sga expenses for companies included in all of both 2002 and 2001 declined 2 in 2002 despite significantly increased rd and other engineering expenses in our scientific and industrial imaging segment most notably redlake masd there was also an increase in corporate sga due primarily to an increase in medical insurance costs and salaries and related employee relocation costs as a percentage of net sales sga expenses also increased in 2002 compared to 2001 for each of our four business segments by between 1 and 2 

interest expense increased 26 million or 16 for the year ended october 31 2002 compared to the year ended october 31 2001 average borrowing levels were approximately 36 higher during fiscal 2002 compared to the prior year due to acquisitions and effective interest rates were approximately 14 lower during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 

a euro debt foreign exchange loss of 41 million arose from eurodenominated debt that was carried in the us and the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 this debt matured near july 31 2002 and was replaced with us dollar denominated debt 

income taxes were 31 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to 35 in fiscal 2001 two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were the change in accounting for goodwill amortization and our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits associated with european tax structures 

during fiscal 2002 we completed a transition review for goodwill impairment under sfas 142 as of november 1 2001 this review initially compared the fair value of each previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value if an impairment was indicated the amount was then determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount this impairment was reported as a change in accounting principle was a noncash charge and was related to the redlake petrotech and dynamco units 

at october 31 2002 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at october 31 2001 this strengthening resulted in a gain of 137 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal 2002 approximately 11 million of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows fiscal 2002’s operating results also benefited slightly from the stronger nonus currencies the benefits were less than 2 of operating earnings foreign exchange differences related to our other nonus subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2002’s financial information 

the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended october 31 dollar amounts in thousands 

 instrumentation segment net orders improved due largely to 2001 and 2002 acquisitions and higher orders for oil and gas desulfurization applications offset somewhat by lower orders for semiconductor capital equipment markets industrial technology segment net orders declined on weak industrial and oil and gas exploration markets energy systems and controls net orders rose because of higher demand for the company’s turbomachinery control systems as well as the 2002 acquisition of zetec with the yeartoyear comparison adversely affected by a 20 million supplemental order from gazprom in 2001 scientific and industrial imaging net orders fell as the benefit from 2002 and 2001 acquisitions was more than offset by weak semiconductor markets and lower motion imaging product activity 

the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at october 31 dollar amounts in thousands 

 a significant impact on the decreased sales order backlog at october 31 2002 compared to october 31 2001 was the 115 million residual onetime supplemental gazprom order which is included in the prior year backlog for energy systems and controls excluding this order total company backlog increased 6 from 1003 million to 1066 million declines in instrumentation and industrial technology were attributable to weak semiconductor and oil exploration markets respectively 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was 713 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 868 million for the twelve months ended october 31 2002 and 1024 million for the twelve months ended october 31 2001 excluding the one time writeoff of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the company of 244 million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 was 957 million an increase of 89 million over fiscal 2002 this increase reflected stronger earnings from operations and reduced inventories most of the decrease in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributed to the onetime supplemental order for gazprom partially offset by improved cash generation from assets we expect our net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2004 to be higher than the levels experienced in the prior three fiscal years due to the ntgh acquisition completed on december 29 2003 cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 were primarily business acquisition costs cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely the borrowing activities associated with the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other net positive cash flows financing activities in fiscal 2003 also included replacing our existing 275 million credit agreement and 125 million senior notes with our current 625 million credit agreement and 230 million senior subordinated convertible notes 

net working capital current assets excluding cash less total current liabilities excluding debt was 1704 million at december 31 2003 compared to 1267 million at october 31 2002 we acquired approximately 702 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal 2003 total debt was 6511 million at december 31 2003 498 of total capital compared to 3321 million at october 31 2002 47 of total capital our increased debt at december 31 2003 compared to october 31 2002 was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current fiscal year to fund the ntgh acquisition and replace the previous credit agreement and senior notes 

our principal 625 million credit facility with a group of banks and our 230 million senior subordinated convertible notes will provide most of our daily external financing requirements the credit facility consists of a 400 million term loan with a five year maturity and a 225 million revolving loan with a three year maturity our senior subordinated convertible notes are due in 2034 at december 31 2003 our debt consisted of the 230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes a 400 million term loan and 20 million drawn against the revolver the company also had 145 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2003 we expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions additionally on january 6 2004 we received approximately 30 million from the exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment in connection with our public offering of common shares we also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our nonus businesses in total these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december 31 2003 

capital expenditures of 104 million 77 million and 74 million were incurred during fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 to be slightly higher as a percentage of sales due to the current higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired neptune technology business 

in november 2003 roper’s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our outstanding common stock to 009625 per share from 00875 per share an increase of 10 this represents the eleventh consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since roper’s 1992 initial public offering our board of directors has declared a dividend payable on january 31 2004 payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors 

description of certain indebtedness new senior secured credit facility 

concurrently with the closing of the ntgh acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in december 2003 we entered into a new 625 million senior secured credit facility the new credit facility consists of a fiveyear 400 million term loan and a threeyear 225 million revolving loan 

our new credit facility requires us to prepay our term loan and in certain cases reduce our commitments under our revolving loan upon the receipt of certain proceeds including from certain asset sales the incurrence of certain debt and up to 75 of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated senior leverage ratio test we are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans 

the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which among other things limit our ability to incur new debt prepay subordinated debt make certain investments and acquisitions sell assets and grant liens make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures or change our line of business we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio 

senior subordinated convertible notes 

in december 2003 we also issued 230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60498 resulting in an effective yield of 375 per year to maturity interest on the notes is payable semiannually beginning july 15 2004 until january 15 2009 after that date we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable instead after january 15 2009 interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 375 and will represent accrual of original issue discount excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january 15 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120 or more of the sum of the issue price accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any for such note the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 025 

the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 

each 1000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 6211 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment if i the sale price of our common stock reaches or the trading price of the notes falls below specified thresholds ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred upon conversion we will have the right to deliver in lieu of common stock cash or a combination of cash and common stock 

holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january 15 2009 january 15 2014 january 15 2019 january 15 2024 and january 15 2029 at stated prices plus accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 

we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after january 15 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest if any including contingent cash interest if any on such notes to the applicable redemption date 

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies the following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2003 dollars in thousands 

  at december 31 2003 and october 31 2002 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities although we maintain an active acquisition program any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 

we anticipate that our recently acquired companies as well as our other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate however the rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal 2004 and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies and none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 

recently issued accounting standards the company adopted statement of accounting financial standard sfas no 143  “accounting for asset retirement obligations” as of november 1 2002 there was no material impact to the company related to this new statement 

the company adopted fasb interpretation no 45  “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” as of january 1 2003 this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee the company has no new guarantees after december 31 2002 requiring the measurement provisions of this interpretation 

in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46“fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” an entity is subject to the consolidation rules of fin 46 and is referred to as a variable interest entity “vie” if the entity’s equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its operations without additional financial support fin 46 applies immediately to all vies created after january 31 2003 and is effective as of december 31 2003 for any vies deemed to be special purpose entities “spes” created prior to february 1 2003 the fasb issued a revision to fin 46 “fin 46r” in december 2003 fin 46r is effective for the interim period ending march 31 2004 for all new or existing vies the company is not required to adopt fin 46 since it has no spes the company will implement the provisions of fin 46r in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 and is evaluating the effect this interpretation will have on the company’s financial statements 

the fasb issued sfas no 148  “accounting for stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition this statement amends certain disclosure requirements of statement 123 currently roper has chosen not to adopt the accounting provisions of sfas 123 however as permitted by sfas 123 the company continues to apply intrinsic value accounting for its stock option plans under accounting principles board opinion no 25 “apb 25” “accounting for stock issued to employees” 

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” which amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 sfas no 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 with some exceptions for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the adoption of sfas 149 on july 1 2003 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements

in november 2002 the eitf issued a final consensus on eitf issue no 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets eitf issue no 0021 is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 companies may also elect to apply the provisions of eitf issue no 0021 to existing arrangements and record the income statement impact as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the company has adopted eitf issue no 0021 prospectively for contracts beginning after june 30 2003 

in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” which clarifies existing sec guidance regarding revenues for contracts that contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with eitf issue no 0021 the adoption of sab 104 did not have a material effect on the company’s financial position operations or cash flows 

information about forward looking statements this annual report includes and incorporates by reference “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws in addition we or our executive officers on our behalf may from time to time make forwardlooking statements in reports and other documents we file with the sec or in connection with oral statements made to the press potential investors or others all statements that are not historical facts are “forwardlooking statements” the words “estimate” “project” “intend” “expect” “believe” “anticipate” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position business financing plans business strategy business prospects revenues working capital liquidity capital needs interest costs and income in each case relating to our company as a whole as well as statements regarding acquisitions potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions including with respect to the ntgh acquisition 

forwardlooking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forwardlooking statements these statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions which in turn are based on currently available information examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions important assumptions relating to the forwardlooking statements include among others assumptions regarding demand for our products the cost timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions raw materials costs expected pricing levels the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures expected outcomes of pending litigation competitive conditions general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions joint ventures and alliances these assumptions could prove inaccurate although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable our expectations may prove to be incorrect important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forwardlooking statements include 

our ability to integrate the ntgh acquisition businesses into our operations any unforeseen liabilities associated with the ntgh businesses or future acquisitions limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness reductions in our business with gazprom the success of our restructuring activities in reducing costs unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates difficulties associated with exports risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses increased product liability and insurance costs increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs product liability and insurance risks increased warranty exposure future competition the cyclical nature of our markets changes in the supply of or price for parts and components environmental compliance costs and liabilities risks and costs associated with asbestosrelated litigation potential writeoffs of our substantial intangible assets our ability to successfully develop new products failure to protect our technology trade tariffs that may be applied due to the us government’s delay in complying with certain wto directives terrorist attacks future health crises and the factors discussed in exhibit 991 to this annual report under the heading “risk factors” we believe these forwardlooking statements are reasonable however you should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements which are based on current expectations further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 

at december 31 2003 we had a combination of fixedrate borrowings primarily our 230 million senior subordinated convertible notes and relatively variable rate borrowings under the 625 million credit facility our 400 million 5year term note under this credit facility was variable at a spread over libor any borrowings under the 225 million revolver have a fixed rate but the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 13 months subsequent to year end we fixed the interest rate at 4108 on 100 million of the term note for a period of two years at december 31 2003 there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments 

at december 31 2003 roper’s outstanding variablerate borrowings under the 625 million credit facility were 420 million an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase our annualized interest costs by 32 million 

several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros british pounds danish krone or japanese yen sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 27 of our total sales and 77 of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency the us dollar weakened against these european currencies during fiscal 2003 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies the difference between fiscal 2003’s operating results for these companies translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2003 and these operating results translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2002 was not material if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout fiscal 2003 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately 14 million 

the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during fiscal 2003 compared to currency exchange rates at october 31 2002 resulted in an increase in net assets of 430 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 336 million of which was attributed to goodwill goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 

the trading price of roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share the stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable

backlog our analytical instrumentation companies have lead times of up to
several months on many of their product sales although standard products are
often shipped within four weeks of receipt of order blanket purchase orders are
placed by certain oems and endusers with continuing requirements for
fulfillment over specified periods of time the segments backlog of firm
unfilled orders including blanket purchase orders totaled 579 million at
october 31 2002 compared to 626 million at october 31 2001 the decrease was
attributed to successful efforts to reduce delivery times at struers and
logitech along with weaker markets conditions particularly in the automotive
electronics and semiconductor end markets

backlog the majority of this segments business consists of larger engineered
oil and gas development and transmission projects with lead times of three to
nine months as such backlog typically fluctuates significantly dependent upon
the timing of large project awards standard products generally ship within two
weeks of receipt of order while shipment of orders for specialty products
varies according to the complexity of the product and availability of the
required components our companies in this segment enters into blanket purchase
orders for the manufacture of products for certain oems and endusers over
periods of time specified by these customers this segments backlog of firm
unfilled orders including blanket purchase orders totaled 354 million at

purchases of control systems through 2007 however we expect sales to gazprom
in fiscal 2003 to be reduced in amount and as a percentage of this segments
sales compared to fiscal 2002 levels the continuation of this business with
gazprom is subject to numerous risks many of which are beyond our control
including but not limited to increased competition availability of acceptable
financing and customer delays in commissioning and startup of installations

backlog the fluid handling operating units sales also reflect a combination of
standard products and specifically engineered applicationspecific products
standard products are typically shipped within two weeks of receipt of order
applicationspecific products typically ship within sixtotwelve weeks
following receipt of order although larger project orders and blanket purchase
orders for certain oems may extend for longer periods this segments backlog of
firm unfilled orders including blanket purchase orders totaled 198 million
at october 31 2002 compared to 217 million at october 31 2001 the decrease
was attributed primarily to significantly reduced demand for semiconductor
equipment products as that market continued to be depressed throughout fiscal
2002

distribution and sales distribution and sales occur through direct sales
personnel manufacturers representatives and stocking and nonstocking
distributors

customers some of the fluid handling segments operating units have sales to
one or a few customers that represent a significant portion of that operating
units sales and the relative importance of such a concentrated customer base
for these operating units is expected to continue however no customer was
responsible for as much as 10 of this segments net sales during fiscal 2002

materials and suppliers

we believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available
from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world which are adequate for
our needs some highperformance components for digital imaging products can be
in short supply andor suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such
components to our specifications we regularly investigate and identify
alternative sources where possible and we believe that these conditions equally
affect our competitors and thus far it has not had a significant adverse
effect on sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply
interruptions

environmental matters and other governmental regulation

ropers operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and
regulations relating to environmental protection including laws and regulations
governing air emissions water discharges waste management and workplace
safety these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial
fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of costly
pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions
andor decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases we
must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory
requirements in all countries as these requirements change it is our policy to
comply with all applicable regulatory requirements

we use and generate hazardous substances and waste in our operations and as a
result could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the
investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties and to claims alleging
personal injury we have experienced and expects to continue to experience
operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in connection
with our acquisitions we may assume significant environmental liabilities some
of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition in addition new
laws and regulations stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations the
discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new cleanup
requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or
increased liabilities

competition

generally the products and solutions we offer our business segments face
significant competition usually from a limited number of competitors although
we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets no single company is a
leading competitor with us over a significant number of product lines
competitors might be large or small in size often depending on the life cycle
and maturity of the technology employed we compete primarily on product
quality performance innovation price applications expertise and customer
service capabilities

patents and trademarks

we own the rights under a number of patents and trademarks relating to certain
of our products and businesses while it believes that none of our operating
units are substantially dependent on any single or group of patents
trademarks or other items of intellectual property rights the product
development and market activities of compressor controls gatan integrated
designs redlake masd and roper scientific in particular have been planned and
conducted in conjunction with important and continuing patent strategies
compressor controls has been granted a series of us and associated foreign
patents and a significant portion of its fiscal 2002 sales was of equipment that
incorporated innovations that are the subject of several such patents that will
not begin to expire until 2004 integrated designs was granted a us patent in
1994 related to methods and apparatus claims embodied in its integrated dispense
systems that accounted for the majority of its fiscal 2002 sales the us
patent will expire in 2011

practices and other matters none of which we believe would have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
the majority of such claims are subject to insurance coverage since 2001 we
andor one of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants along with many
other companies in asbestosrelated personal injury or wrongful death actions
the allegations in these actions are vague general and speculative and the
actions are in their early stages given the state of these claims it is not
possible to determine the potential liability in any

of december 31 2002 there were 203 record holders of our common stock

dividends roper has declared a cash dividend in each fiscal quarter since our
february 1992 initial public offering and we have also annually increased our
dividend rate since our initial public offering in november 2002 our board of
directors increased the quarterly dividend to be paid in the first quarter of
fiscal 2003 to 00875 per share an increase of 6 from the prior rate
however the timing declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the
sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our
profitability financial condition capital needs future prospects and other
factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore there can be no
assurance as to the amount if any of cash dividends that will be declared in
the future

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selection
financial information and our consolidated financial statements and related
notes included elsewhere in this annual report within this annual report we
have provided pro forma sales and sales orders information this pro forma
information is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and does not conform to the pro forma information presented in our
consolidated financial statements we present this pro forma information because
management believes that the information illustrates the impact of acquisitions
on our performance

for the purposes of calculating pro forma net sales net sales orders and sales
order backlog information we have added sales and sales order information of
each company that roper has acquired during one of the two periods being
compared to the appropriate period so that the acquired companys results are
included for the same number of months for both periods further pro forma net
sales net sales orders and sales order backlog information exclude amounts
attributable to discontinued or divested operations for the period presented

application of critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the united states or gaap a discussion of
our significant accounting policies can be found in the notes to our
consolidated financial statements for the year ended october 31 2002 included
elsewhere in this annual report

gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues
affecting our financial results such as determining inventory cost
depreciating longlived assets recognizing revenues and issuing stock options
to employees we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting
methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these
principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our
financial statements except for the adoption of statement of financial
accounting standards or sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets
as discussed below

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use
of estimates assumptions judgments and interpretations that can affect the
reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures

the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management
our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the
audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed all
financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec although we believe
the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable others
might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more
information becomes available if an accounting estimate changes its effects
are accounted for prospectively

our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of
accounts receivable collectibility inventory utilization future warranty
obligations revenue recognition percent of completion income taxes and
goodwill analysis these issues except for income taxes which are not
allocated to our business segments affect each of our business segments these
issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience
current conditions and relatively shortterm forecasting

accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of
customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products including
in certain cases credits for returned products accounts receivable are
regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon
terms whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences what
historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact
that current and nearterm forecast economic conditions might have on collection
efforts in general and with specific customers the returns and other sales
credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such
credits at october 31 2002 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable
sales returns and sales credits was 38 million or 3 of total gross accounts
receivable excluding securitized gazprom receivables from a vendor financing
program this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying
receivables during 2002 that profile improved with the acquisition of zetec
and other improvements in collections from core businesses and the allowance
was reduced as a percent of net sales by 50 basis points

we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future
usage which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related
to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities
when we use historical usage this information is also qualitatively compared to
business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information
as an estimate of future usage business trends can change rapidly and these
events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances at october 31 2002
inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were 202 million or 18
of gross firstin firstout inventory cost this percentage has increased by
390 basis points over the year as the relative age of inventory increased during
the cyclical downturn

most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for
the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period
after the time of sale typically 12 months future warranty obligations are
evaluated using among other factors historical cost experience product
evolution and customer feedback at october 31 2002 the accrual for future
warranty obligations was 37 million or 05 of proforma sales our expense for
warranty obligations was less than 1 of net sales for each of the three years
ended october 31 2002

revenues related to the use of the percentageofcompletion method of accounting
are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total
estimated costs for a project during fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 we recognized
revenue of approximately 19 million 79 million and 56 million
respectively using this method in addition approximately 83 million of
revenue related to unfinished percentageofcompletion contracts had yet to be
recognized at october 31 2002 contracts accounted for under this method are
generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted
for under other methods

income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which
jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated
to the united states combined with other aspects of an overall income tax
strategy additionally taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with
our tax treatment of certain items and some historical transactions have income
tax effects going forward accounting rules require these future effects to be
evaluated using current laws rules and regulations each of which can change at
any time and in an unpredictable manner during fiscal 2002 our effective
income tax rate was reduced to 31 from 34 two of the key factors related to
the reduced rate were our expected utilization of all available foreign income
tax credits and the accounting change related to goodwill amortization that was
expensed for book purposes prior to the adoption of sfas 142 but not deductible
for income tax purposes

we adopted sfas no 142 effective november 1 2001  the beginning of our fiscal
2002 sfas 142 issued in june 2001 requires the adoption of its provisions by
the beginning of our fiscal 2003 but the timing of our fiscal year end also
allowed it to elect to adopt sfas 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002 based
primarily on investor interest to see results reflecting adoption of sfas 142
we elected to adopt this new standard at the earlier date

the evaluation of goodwill under sfas 142 requires valuations of each applicable
underlying business these valuations can be significantly affected by estimates
of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time
market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related
markets these estimates will likely change over time some of our businesses
operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be
expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality the transitional business
valuation reviews required by sfas 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying
value of goodwill for three business units in the analytical instrumentation and
industrial controls segments this goodwill reduction has been reported as a
change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of fiscal 2002 and
resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately 26 million
after the adoption of sfas 142 goodwill is required to be evaluated annually
if this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances that
entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of
current operations our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill
component and we expect to continue with future acquisitions

prior to adopting sfas 142 goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40
years with the adoption of this standard goodwill is not amortized it is
periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above sfas 142 does not
permit retroactive application to years prior to adoption therefore earnings
beginning in fiscal 2002 tend to be higher than earlier periods as a result of
this accounting change except for the effects of any impairment provision on
current results note 5 to our consolidated financial statements includes a
reconciliation comparing earnings of preadoption periods to earnings of current
periods for those periods presented goodwill amortization prior to the adoption
of sfas 142 was largest in the analytical instrumentation segment and the amount
of goodwill currently recorded is also largest for this segment we believe it
inappropriate to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge
resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment
compared to another segment

year ended october 31 2002 compared to year ended october 31 2001

net sales for fiscal 2002 were 6270 million a 7 increase compared to fiscal
2001 and a 7 decrease on a proforma basis compared to fiscal 2001 the 7
increase over prior year is attributable to the inclusion of full year sales
from struers and logitech which were acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001 as well as sales from the acquisition of zetec in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002 these sales increases were offset by exiting certain petrotech
businesses and sales declines in other businesses due to widespread weak
economic conditions the 7 decrease compared to pro forma net sales is
primarily attributable to exiting of certain petrotech businesses continued
declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and gas exploration
and certain industrial markets the impact of these difficult market conditions
was somewhat mitigated by a 15 increase in sales to gazprom and an 8 increase
in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their products help
customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding sulfur content in
petroleum products

in our analytical instrumentation segment actual net sales increased 21 and
proforma net sales decreased 7 the increase in actual net sales resulted
principally from the contribution of acquisitions and increased sales in our
fluid properties testing businesses this was offset by lower sales into
semiconductor markets and lower motion product sales by redlake due to the
pending release of a new generation of products that we anticipate to begin
shipping during the first half of fiscal 2003

in our fluid handling segment net sales declined 16 compared to fiscal 2001
primarily from the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market and
weakness in industrial and oil  gas exploration markets

in our industrial controls segment actual net sales increased 3 and proforma
net sales were roughly flat with fiscal 2001 actual net sales increased
primarily as a result of the acquisition of zetec and gains from certain oil 
gas control system applications particularly those sold to gazprom partly
reduced by lower sales from exiting certain petrotech businesses in fiscal 2001

the increase in our overall gross profit percentage to 536 in fiscal 2002
compared to 527 to in fiscal 2001 was mostly due to exiting low margin
businesses at petrotech this also caused an increase in margins for the
industrial controls segment to 537 in fiscal 2002 compared to 511 in fiscal
2001 analytical instrumentation gross margins were roughly flat at 561 in
fiscal 2002 compared to 559 in fiscal 2001 fluid handlings gross margins
decreased to 462 in fiscal 2002 compared to 484 in fiscal 2001 this
decrease was caused mostly by adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps
businesses

excluding the effects from the accounting change related to goodwill and the
restructuring charges expensed in fiscal 2001 selling general and
administrative sga expenses increased to 353 of net sales in fiscal 2002
compared to 328 of sales in fiscal 2001 this increase is attributable to
higher sga expense levels at newly acquired businesses sga expenses for
companies included in all of both 2002 and 2001 declined 2 in 2002 despite
significantly increased rd and other engineering expenses at some of our
digital imaging companies this spending was most notable at redlake masd as it
continues to develop new products it expects to be available in the

second quarter of fiscal 2003 there was also an increase in corporate sga due
primarily to an increase in medical insurance costs and salaries and related
employee relocation costs as a percentage of net sales sga expenses also
increased in 2002 compared to 2001 for each of our three business segments by
between 1 and 2

interest expense increased 26 million or 16 for the year ended october 31
2002 compared to the year ended october 31 2001 average borrowing levels were
approximately 36 higher during fiscal 2002 compared to the prior year and
effective interest rates were approximately 14 lower during fiscal 2002
compared to fiscal 2001 higher borrowing levels in fiscal 2002 were primarily
from the september 2001 acquisition of struers and logitech and the july 2002
acquisition of zetec

a euro debt foreign exchange loss of 41 million arose from eurodenominated
debt that was carried in the us and the strengthening of the euro against the
us dollar during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 this debt matured near july
31 2002 and was replaced with us dollar denominated debt

income taxes were 31 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to 35 in
fiscal 2001 two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were the change
in accounting for goodwill amortization and our expected utilization of all
available foreign income tax credits associated with european tax structures

during fiscal 2002 we completed a transition review for goodwill impairment
under sfas 142 as of november 1 2001 this review initially compared the fair
value of each previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value if an
impairment was indicated the amount was then determined by comparing the
implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount this impairment was
reported as a change in accounting principle was a noncash charge and was
related to the redlake petrotech and dynamco units

at october 31 2002 the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were
stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at october
31 2001 this strengthening resulted in a gain of 137 million in the foreign
exchange component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal 2002 approximately 11
million of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly
affect our expected future cash flows fiscal 2002s operating results also
benefited slightly from the stronger nonus currencies the benefits were less
than 2 of operating earnings foreign exchange differences related to our other
nonus subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2002s financial information

our fluid handling segment was more exposed to poor semiconductor conditions
than the other two segments semiconductorrelated sales orders were down
significantly in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 excluding this business
fluid handlings net sales orders decreased 10 in fiscal 2002 compared to
fiscal 2001

the decrease in analytical instrumentation net sales orders was attributed to
weak semiconductor  electronics and automotive markets that more than offset
the increase in fluid properties testing aside from the semiconductor decline
the fluid handling segment decline in net sales orders also reflected the weak
oil and gas exploration and power generation markets a onetime supplemental
order of 20 million from gazprom in fiscal 2001 caused unfavorable comparisons
in the industrial controls segment

a significant impact on the decreased sales order backlog at october 31 2002
compared to october 31 2001 was the 115 million residual onetime
supplemental gazprom order which is included in the prior year backlog for
industrial controls excluding this order backlog is up 2 declines in
analytical instrumentation and fluid handling were attributable to weak
electronics and oil exploration markets respectively

year ended october 31 2001 compared to year ended october 31 2000

net sales for fiscal 2001 were 5865 million a 16 increase compared to fiscal
2000 excluding sales to gazprom net sales increased 14 in fiscal 2001
compared to fiscal 2000 fiscal 2001 pro forma net sales increased 5 compared
to pro forma net sales during fiscal 2000

in our analytical instrumentation segment actual net sales increased 18 in
fiscal 2001 and pro forma net sales increased 5 the increase in actual net
sales resulted mostly from the contribution of companies acquired during fiscal
2001 and 2000 the increase in pro forma net sales resulted mostly from strong
digital imaging demand from research markets weakness in the automobile
industry adversely affected sales of our highspeed digital camera products and
our industrial leak test products

in our fluid handling segment actual net sales increased 3 in fiscal 2001 and
pro forma net sales decreased 7 actual net sales increased primarily as the
result of companies acquired during fiscal 2001 and 2000 pro forma net sales
decreased primarily as the result of depressed business conditions in the
semiconductor industry this segments pro forma net sales to this industry
decreased 33 in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 net sales in fiscal 2001
for this segments businesses not serving the semiconductor industry increased
2 compared to pro forma net sales in fiscal 2000

in our industrial controls segment actual net sales increased 24 and pro forma
net sales increased 13 actual net sales increased primarily as a result of
companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2000 increased shipments to
gazprom and higher revenues from customers in energy markets these increases
were partially offset by lower revenues at petrotech that resulted from
restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal 2001 pro forma net sales
increased primarily as a

result of additional sales to gazprom sales to gazprom were 493 million
during fiscal 2001 or an increase of 45 compared to fiscal 2000

our overall gross profit percentage increased to 527 in fiscal 2001 compared
to 514 in fiscal 2000 several factors were the largest contributors to the
change the largest factor was the growth in our analytical instrumentation
segment the highest gross margin segment other large factors contributing to
increased margins were improved leverage on the additional sales to gazprom and
the benefits from exiting certain low margin businesses at petrotech during
2001 increased sales from our lower margin refrigeration valves business that
was acquired in september 2000 adversely affected margins

analytical instrumentations gross margin increased to 559 in fiscal 2001
compared to 544 in fiscal 2000 most of this improvement resulted from
favorable leverage related to increased digital imaging sales and the
incremental sales at struers and logitech that were at relatively high margins
fluid handlings gross margin decreased to 484 in fiscal 2001 compared to
485 in fiscal 2000 this decrease was caused mostly by lower sales of its high
margin semiconductorrelated products industrial controls gross margin
increased to 511 in fiscal 2001 compared to 493 in fiscal 2000 this
increase was caused primarily by the favorable effects of increased sales to
gazprom and lower sales from exited businesses and was partially offset by
increased sales of lowermargin refrigeration valve products

          restructuring charges included in fiscal 2001

the increase in sga costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2001 compared
to fiscal 2000 for the fluid handling segment was caused by the adverse leverage
that resulted from the quick and deep cyclical decline in the segments
semiconductorrelated business other changes in the relationships between sga
costs and net sales were not considered significant

interest expense was 159 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 135 million in
fiscal 2000 interest expense was higher in fiscal 2001 mostly due to the
borrowings associated with the acquisitions that occurred since the beginning of
fiscal 2000 all of these acquisitions representing total costs of over 330
million during these two fiscal years were paid for with cash provided by our
thenexisting credit facilities shortterm interest rates started to decline
dramatically early in calendar 2001 the effective interest rate was
approximately 65 during fiscal 2001 compared to approximately 69 during
fiscal 2000

the provision for income taxes was 354 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2001
compared to 351 in fiscal 2000 this change was not considered significant

the other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2001 were currency
translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies
other than the us dollar these net assets were primarily denominated in
euros british pounds danish krone or japanese yen during fiscal 2001 the
us dollar weakened against the euro was relatively stable against the pound
and strengthened against the yen and krone after the acquisition of danish
assets in september 2001 during fiscal 2001 our consolidated net assets
increased 12 million due to foreign currency translation adjustments

the decrease in analytical instrumentations pro forma net sales orders in
fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was broadbased net sales orders for each
major product group declined from 2  9 this segments businesses were
adversely affected by poor market conditions in the automotive and semiconductor
industries the decrease in pro forma net sales orders for the fluid handling
segment was caused largely by a decline in semiconductorrelated orders the
increase in pro forma net sales orders for the industrial controls segment was
caused primarily by additional orders from gazprom

financial condition liquidity and capital resources

net cash provided by operating activities was 870 million in fiscal 2002
1024 million in fiscal 2001 and 676 million during fiscal 2000 most of this
decrease in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributed to the onetime
supplemental order for gazprom partially offset by improved cash generation
from assets cash flows from investing activities during each of fiscal 2002
2001 and 2000 were mostly business acquisition costs cash flows from financing
activities during each of these years were mostly the borrowing activities
associated with the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other
net positive cash flows financing activities in fiscal 2000 also included
refinancing our thenexisting 200 million credit agreement with our current
275 million credit facility and the issuance of 125 million of senior notes

total current assets excluding cash exceeded total current liabilities
excluding debt by 1255 million at october 31 2002 compared to 1156 million
at october 31 2001 we acquired approximately 10 million of net current assets
through business acquisitions during fiscal 2002 we also financed a 20 million
onetime supplemental order for gazprom working capital was otherwise reduced
by approximately 20 million during fiscal 2002 due to improved management of
our accounts receivable inventories and payables total debt was 3321 million
at october 31 2002 47 of total capital compared to 3268 million at october
31 2001 50 of total capital our increased debt at october 31 2002 compared
to that a year ago was due to the borrowings incurred to fund fiscal 2002
business acquisitions in excess of cash generated by existing operations

our principal 275 million credit facility with a group of banks provides most
of our daily external financing requirements consisting of revolving loans
swing line loans and letters of credit at october 31 2002 utilization of this
facility included 1447 million of us denominated borrowings the equivalent
of 417 million of nonus denominated borrowings and 33 million of
outstanding letters of credit total unused availability under this facility was
853 million at october 31 2002 we expect that our available additional
borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from
existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and
finance some additional acquisitions this facility matures may 2005 we also
have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of
letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our nonus
businesses in total these smaller facilities do not represent a significant
source of credit for us

our outstanding indebtedness at october 31 2002 also included 125 million of
term notes maturing in may 2007 and may 2010 and do not require sinking fund
payments we may prepay the notes by paying the holders thereof the discounted
present value of all remaining scheduled payments using a discount rate equal to
the sum of 50 basis points plus the yield of the us treasury notes
corresponding to the then remaining average life of the notes being prepaid

capital expenditures of 78 million 75 million and 152 million were
incurred during fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively we expect capital
expenditures in fiscal 2003 to be comparable as a percentage of sales to the
past two years

      at october 31 2002 and 2001 we did not have any relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have
been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements
or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability
under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating
requirements and further acquisition activities although we maintain an active
acquisition program any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous
factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such
acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities financial
condition and results of operations we may also explore alternatives to attract
additional capital resources

we anticipate that our recently acquired companies as well as our other
companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that
these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a
pace consistent with that which has historically been experienced however the
rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal 2003 and reduce the
associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the
financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial
performance of our existing companies and none of these factors can be
predicted with certainty

recently issued accounting standards

the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas 143  accounting
for asset retirement obligations that roper is required to adopt by november 1
2002 roper does not currently have nor is it expected to have any material
asset retirement obligations subject to this new standard

the fasb issued sfas 144  accounting for the impairment or disposal of
longlived assets that roper is required to adopt by november 1 2002 this new
standard does not apply to goodwill roper does not expect the adoption of this
standard to result in an impairment charge

the fasb issued sfas 145 that rescinded amended or made technical corrections
to several previously issued statements none of these changes are expected to
significantly affect ropers accounting or financial reporting practices

the fasb issued sfas 146  accounting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities that roper is required to adopt for applicable transactions
after december 31 2002 this standard modifies the timing of when certain costs
are reported

outlook

we currently expect sales and net income for fiscal 2003 to be higher than for
fiscal 2002 fiscal 2003 is expected to benefit from the fullyear contributions
from the businesses acquired during fiscal 2002 especially zetec from
additional efforts to make our companies more efficient and from reduced
interest expense resulting from paying down our debt the conditions in the
semiconductor industry are currently poor and we do not expect any meaningful
recovery in this industry during fiscal 2003 the overall economic conditions of
the usa and europe are sluggish and both the federal reserve board and the
european central bank recently lowered discount rates yet again in an effort to
stimulate the respective economies there continue to be terrorist threats
against the us and its allies and also the possibility of military action
against iraq a significant terrorist attack or military action against iraq
could cause changes in world economies that would adversely affect us it is
impossible to isolate each of these factors effects on current economic
conditions it is also impossible to predict with any reasonable degree of
certainty what or when any additional events may occur that also will similarly
disrupt the economy

we expect to continue an active acquisition program however completion of
future acquisitions and their impact on ours results or financial condition
cannot be accurately predicted

information about forward looking statements

      this annual report contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning
of the federal securities laws in addition we or our executive officers on
our behalf may from time to time make forwardlooking statements in reports and
other documents we file with the sec or in connection with oral statements made
to the press potential investors or others statements that are not historical

risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forwardlooking statement many of these factors are
beyond our ability to control or predict such factors include but are not
limited to the following

      o     reductions in our business with gazprom


                                       28

      o     difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired
            businesses

      o     increased product liability and insurance costs

      o     increased warranty exposure

      o     the fact that our former independent auditors arthur andersen llp

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings we are
exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in
currencies other than the us dollar we are also exposed to equity market
risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock

at october 31 2002 we had a combination of fixedrate borrowings primarily
125 million of term notes and relatively variablerate borrowings primarily
borrowings under the 275 million credit facility although each borrowing
under the 275 million credit facility has a fixed rate the terms of these
individual borrowings are generally only 13 months

at october 31 2002 prevailing market interest rates were lower than the fixed
rates on the term notes by 23 percentage points this resulted in the estimated
fair values of the term notes using a discounted cash flows model being greater
than the face amounts of the notes by an estimated 156 million and it
represented an unrecorded decrease in our net assets at october 31 2002 there
was a comparable unrecorded decrease in our net assets of 117 million at
october 31 2001 if interest rates had been 1 higher at october 31 2002 the
difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would
have been approximately 71 million smaller these interest rate differences do
not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows

at october 31 2002 ropers outstanding variablerate borrowings under the 275
million credit facility were 1864 million an increase in interest rates of 1
would increase our annualized interest costs by 19 million

several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies
other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are
denominated in euros british pounds danish krone or japanese yen

sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 28 of
our total sales and 80 of these sales were by companies with a european
functional currency the us dollar weakened against these european currencies
during fiscal 2002 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies the
difference between fiscal 2002s operating results for these companies
translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced
during fiscal 2002 and these operating results translated into us dollars at
average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2001 was not material
if these currency exchange rates had been 10 different throughout fiscal 2002
compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced the impact on our
expected net earnings would have been approximately 2 million

the changes of these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during
fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates at october 31 2001 resulted in
an increase in net assets of 137 million that was reported as a component of
comprehensive earnings 109 million of which was attributed to goodwill
goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our
reported earnings or cash flows

the trading price of ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock
option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed
in our financial statements the stock prices also influence the computation of
the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings
per share the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various
programs that involve our common stock we believe the quantification of the
effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not
readily determinable



item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and
        financial disclosure

on may 14 2002 roper terminated its relationship with arthur andersen llp
arthur andersen as our independent public accountants and engaged
pricewaterhousecoopers llp as our independent public accountants the decision
to change independent public accountants was recommended by the audit committee
and approved by our board of directors

in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements as of and
for the two fiscal years ended october 31 2001 and with respect to the
subsequent period through january 31 2002 there were no disagreements with
arthur andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures which disagreements if
not resolved to arthur andersens satisfaction would have caused them to make
reference in connection with their report on our consolidated financial
statements to the subject matter of the disagreement

arthur andersens reports on our consolidated financial statements for the past
two years ended october 31 2001 did not contain any adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty
audit scope or accounting principles

we provided arthur andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosure attached as
exhibit 16 is a copy of arthur andersens letter dated may 31 2002 stating
its agreement with such statements

industrial controls fluid handling and analytical instrumentation products
worldwide serving selected segments of a broad range of markets the principal
markets include oil  gas research medical semiconductor refrigeration
automotive water and wastewater power generation agricultural irrigation
industries and general industrial

roper pursues consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by
operating and acquiring businesses that manufacture and sell high valueadded
highly engineered industrial products that are capable of achieving and
maintaining high margins this strategy continually emphasizes i increasing
market share and market expansion ii new product development iii improving
productivity and reducing costs and iv acquisition of similar businesses see

market share market expansion and product development roper competes in many
narrowly defined niche markets its position in these markets is typically as
the market leader or as a competitive alternate to the market leader in those
markets where roper is regionally dominant it seeks to sustain growth through
geographic expansion of its marketing efforts and the development of new
products for associated markets

roper continued its growth in fiscal 2001 principally through internal growth of
many of its core businesses and by new business acquisitions in the industrial
controls segment dynamco was acquired in may 2001 roper acquired three new
analytical instrumentation companies during the year media cybernetics was
acquired in july 2001 struers and logitech were acquired in september 2001

these new business acquisitions were financed principally from borrowings and
represented a combined investment of approximately 1702 million ropers debt
under its primary credit facilities was 3235 million at october 31 2001 and
2326 million at october 31 2000 total debt was 50 and 47 of total
capitalization at october 31 2001 and 2000 respectively total debt at
yearend was 25x and 22x the preceding years ebitda earnings before
interest taxes depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2001 and 2000
respectively roper believes it is well positioned for additional new business
and other business acquisitions

international sales sales outside the united states continue to play an
important part in ropers overall operating results including such sales of
usbased businesses in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 ropers net sales outside

specified by such customers the segments backlog of firm unfilled orders
including blanket purchase orders totaled 312 million at october 31 2001
compared to 292 million as of october 31 2000 the increase in backlog is

backlog the fluid handling companies sales also reflect a combination of
standard products and specifically engineered applicationspecific products
standard products are typically shipped within two weeks of receipt of order
applicationspecific products typically ship within sixtotwelve weeks
following receipt of order although larger project orders and blanket purchase
orders for certain oems may extend for longer periods this segments backlog of
firm unfilled orders including blanket purchase orders totaled 217 million
at october 31 2001 compared to 261 million as of october 31 2000 the

equally affects its competitors and thus far it has not had a significant
adverse effect on sales

year ended october 31 2001 compared to year ended october 31 2000

net sales for fiscal 2001 were 5865 million a 16 increase compared to fiscal
2000 excluding sales to rao gazprom gazprom a large russian natural gas
company net sales increased 14 in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 fiscal
2001 pro forma net sales adjusted to remove exited operations increased 5
compared to pro forma net sales during fiscal 2000 also adjusted to include the
results of companies acquired during fiscal 2001 for the same length of time as
included in fiscal 2001s results

in the analytical instrumentation segment actual net sales increased 18 and
pro forma net sales increased 5 the increase in actual net sales resulted
mostly from the contribution of companies acquired during fiscal 2001 and 2000
the increase in pro forma net sales resulted mostly from strong digital imaging
demand from research markets weakness in the automobile industry adversely
affected sales of ropers highspeed digital camera products and its industrial
leak test products

in the fluid handling segment actual net sales increased 3 and pro forma net
sales decreased 7 actual net sales increased primarily as the result of
companies acquired over the past two years pro forma net sales decreased
primarily as the result of depressed business conditions in the semiconductor
industry this segments pro forma net sales to this industry decreased 33 in
fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 roper expects these sales to be lower still
in fiscal 2002 net sales in fiscal 2001 for this segments businesses not
serving the semiconductor industry increased 2 compared to pro forma net sales
in fiscal 2000

in the industrial controls segment actual net sales increased 24 and pro forma
net sales increased 13 actual net sales increased primarily as a result of
companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2000 increased shipments to
gazprom and higher revenues from customers in energy markets these increases
were partially offset by lower revenues at petrotech that resulted from
restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal 2001 pro forma net sales
increased primarily as a result of additional sales to gazprom sales to gazprom
were 493 million during fiscal 2001 or an increase of 45 compared to fiscal
2000

ropers overall gross profit percentage increased to 527 in fiscal 2001
compared to 514 in fiscal 2000 several factors were the largest contributors
to the change the largest factor was the growth in the analytical
instrumentation segment ropers highest gross margin segment other large
factors contributing to increased margins were improved leverage on the
additional sales to gazprom and the benefits from exiting certain low margin
businesses at petrotech during 2001 adversely affecting margins were the
increased sales from ropers lower margin refrigeration valves business that was
acquired in september 2000

analytical instrumentations gross margin increased to 559 in fiscal 2001
compared to 544 in fiscal 2000 most of this improvement resulted from
favorable leverage related to increased digital imaging sales and the
incremental sales at struers and logitech that were at relatively high margins
fluid handlings gross margin decreased to 484 in fiscal 2001 compared to
485 in fiscal 2000 this decrease was caused mostly by lower sales of its high
margin semiconductorrelated products industrial controls gross margin
increased to 511 in fiscal 2001 compared to 493 in fiscal

2000 this increase was caused primarily by the favorable effects of increased
sales to gazprom and lower sales from exited businesses and was partially
offset by increased sales of lowermargin refrigeration valve products

the increase in sga costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2001 compared
to fiscal 2000 for the fluid handling segment was caused by the adverse leverage
that resulted from the quick and deep cyclical decline in the segments
semiconductorrelated business other changes in the relationships between sga
costs and net sales were not considered significant

interest expense was 159 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 135 million in
fiscal 2000 interest expense was higher in fiscal 2001 mostly due to the
borrowings associated with the acquisitions that occurred since the beginning of
fiscal 2000 all of these acquisitions representing total costs of over 330
million during these two fiscal years were paid for with cash provided by
ropers thenexisting credit facilities shortterm interest rates started to
decline dramatically early in calendar 2001 ropers effective interest rate was
approximately 65 during fiscal 2001 compared to approximately 69 during
fiscal 2000

the provision for income taxes was 354 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2001
compared to 351 in fiscal 2000 this change was not considered significant

ropers other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2001 were currency
translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies
other than the us dollar these net assets were primarily denominated in euros
or euroequivalent currencies british pounds danish krone or japanese yen
during fiscal 2001 the us dollar weakened against the euro was relatively
stable against the pound and strengthened against the yen and krone after the
acquisition of danish assets in september during fiscal 2001 ropers
consolidated net assets increased 12 million due to foreign currency
translation adjustments

the decrease in analytical instrumentations pro forma net sales orders in
fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was broadbased net sales orders for each
major product group declined from 2  9 this segments businesses were
adversely affected by poor market conditions in the automotive and semiconductor
industries the decrease in pro forma net sales orders for the fluid handling
segment was caused largely by a decline in semiconductorrelated orders the
increase in pro forma net sales orders for the industrial controls segment was
caused primarily by additional orders from gazprom

changes in sales order backlog were consistent with changes in net sales orders

year ended october 31 2000 compared to year ended october 31 1999

net sales for fiscal 2000 of 5038 million were up 24 compared to the prior
year excluding net sales to gazprom net sales increased 26 in fiscal 2000
compared to fiscal 1999 net sales for fiscal 2000 were 1 less than pro forma
net sales for fiscal 1999

net sales for the analytical instrumentation segment increased 50 mostly the
result of business acquisitions petroleum analyzer masd antek instruments and
other smaller businesses this segments net sales were 2 less than the prior
years pro forma net sales largely from lower comparative sales in fluid
properties test equipment markets

net sales for the fluid handling segment increased 23 mostly the result of
business acquisitions abel pump and other smaller businesses and a very strong
fiscal 2000 for this segments

semiconductorrelated business this segments net sales were 6 higher than pro
forma net sales for fiscal 1999 fluid handlings historical semiconductor
business increased its net sales in fiscal 2000 by 81 partly from favorable
comparisons to reported net sales in the first half of fiscal 1999 and its
acquired business increased its net sales by 51 compared to the same period in
the prior year fiscal 2000 net sales for this segments centrifugal pump
business decreased 19 compared to the prior year due to weak agricultural and
waterwastewater markets agricultural markets were adversely impacted by
widespread drought conditions and low commodity prices in the united states
roper believes the municipal water and wastewater markets were adversely
affected by resources diverted to minimize y2k exposures early in fiscal 2000
and its centrifugal pump business had increased exposure to these markets as it
developed larger pumps to pursue more lucrative projects fluid handlings
piston metering pumps business net sales were also down 15 compared to fiscal
1999 as this companys largest customer reduced its purchases until it resolves
an fda compliance problem unrelated to this companys products

net sales for the industrial controls segment decreased less than 1 in fiscal
2000 compared to fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000 net sales were 3 less than pro
forma fiscal 1999 net sales the timing of this segments primary fiscal 2000
acquisition hansen technologies in september 2000 was such that it did not
significantly affect fiscal 2000 results this segment was significantly
influenced by conditions in the exploration and production sectors of the oil 
gas industry roper believes several large oil  gas business combinations early
in the year delayed capital spending programs and spending had yet to recover
from the effects of relatively low oil and natural gas prices throughout much of
fiscal 1999 throughout fiscal 2000 net sales each quarter excluding sales to
gazprom improved in comparison to the same quarter of fiscal 1999 whereas
these first quarter net sales were down 22 compared to the prior year fourth
quarter net sales also excluding hansen technologies were up 13 net sales to
gazprom of 339 million in fiscal 2000 were comparable to fiscal 1999 net sales
of 350 million

the gross profit percentage for the analytical instrumentation segment decreased
to 544 in fiscal 2000 compared to 563 in fiscal 1999 this decrease arose
mostly from the inclusion of masd for most of fiscal 2000 if masds results
were excluded from the segments results in fiscal 2000 the segments gross
profit percentage was 559

sga expenses increased as a percentage of net sales for roper as a whole
because of the increased costs in the fluid handling segment and the increased
size of the analytical

instrumentation segment with its relatively high level of sga expenses compared
to ropers other business segments

sga expenses for the fluid handling segment increased as a percentage of net
sales mostly due to relatively high cost structures of recent acquisitions
particularly abel pump and flowdata another significant reason for this
segments increased sga expenses as a percentage of net sales was the adverse
leverage associated with the decline in the segments centrifugal pump business
combined with the added costs of this business moving into a larger facility
early in fiscal 2000 other changes in the relationships between sga costs and
net sales were not considered significant

interest expense was 135 million in fiscal 2000 compared to 73 million in
fiscal 1999 interest expense was higher in fiscal 2000 due primarily to the
borrowings associated with the numerous acquisitions that occurred during fiscal
1999 and especially during fiscal 2000 all of these acquisitions representing
total costs of approximately 200 million during these two fiscal years were
paid for with cash provided by ropers thenexisting credit facilities

the provision for income taxes was 351 of pretax earnings in fiscal 2000
compared to 345 in fiscal 1999 the increase in the effective income tax rate
was due to several of the recent acquisitions located in relatively high income
tax rate jurisdictions and the amortization of some goodwill associated with
these acquisitions was not deductible for income tax purposes

ropers other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2000 were currency
translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies
other than the us dollar these net assets were primarily denominated in
euros british pounds or japanese yen the us dollar strengthened against each
of these currencies during fiscal 2000 but especially against the euro and
particularly during ropers fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 during fiscal 2000
ropers consolidated net assets decreased 67 million 41 million in the
fourth quarter due to foreign currency translation adjustments ropers
goodwill denominated in nonus currencies also decreased by 67 million due
to currency translation adjustments

the increase in analytical instrumentations net sales orders in fiscal 2000
compared to fiscal 1999 pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to an 8
increase in the segments digital imaging businesses and a 20 increase in its
spectroscopy business which was influenced by the strong semiconductor
industry

the increase in fluid handlings net sales orders in fiscal 2000 compared to
fiscal 1999 pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to continued strength in
the segments semiconductorrelated businesses whose net sales orders increased
68



financial condition liquidity and capital resources

total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by 1292 million at
october 31 2001 compared to 1295 million at october 31 2000 total debt was
3268 million at october 31 2001 50 of total capital compared to 2413
million at october 31 2000 47 of total capital ropers increased debt and
increased financial leverage at october 31 2001 compared to that a year ago was
due to the additional borrowings incurred to fund fiscal 2001 business
acquisitions

ropers principal 275 million credit facility with a group of banks provides
most of its daily external financing requirements consisting of revolving
loans swing line loans and letters of credit at october 31 2001 utilization
of this facility included 865 million of us denominated borrowings the
equivalent of 916 million of nonus denominated borrowings and 29 million
of outstanding letters of credit total unused availability under this facility
was 940 million at october 31 2001 this facility matures may 2005 roper
also has a number of smaller facilities in various nonus locations to support
the businesses in these locations

ropers outstanding indebtedness at october 31 2001 also included 125 million
of term notes one set of notes totaling 40 million matures may 2007 the other
set of notes totaling 85 million matures may 2010 neither set of notes
requires sinking fund payments roper may prepay either set of notes by paying
the holders thereof the discounted present value of all remaining scheduled
payments using a discount rate equal to a riskfree rate plus a margin

although the excess of current assets over current liabilities at october 31
2001 and 2000 were similar roper acquired approximately 30 million of net
current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal 2001 reductions in
net current assets were attributed to improved management of accounts
receivable inventories and payables

capital expenditures were 75 million during fiscal 2001 compared to the 152
million incurred during fiscal 2000

in november 2001 ropers board of directors increased the quarterly cash
dividend paid on its outstanding common stock to 00825 per share from 0075
per share an increase of 10 this represents the ninth consecutive year in
which the quarterly dividend has been increased since ropers 1992 initial
public offering ropers board of directors has declared a dividend payable on
january 31 2002 payment of any additional dividends requires further action by
the board of directors

roper believes that internally generated cash flows and the remaining
availability under its various credit facilities will be adequate to finance
normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities although roper
maintains an active acquisition program any further acquisitions will be
dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if
or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on ropers
activities financial condition and results of operations roper may also
explore alternatives to increase its access to additional capital resources

roper anticipates that its recently acquired companies as well as its other
companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities and that
these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a
pace consistent with that which roper historically has experienced however the
rate at which roper can reduce its debt during fiscal 2002 and reduce the
associated interest expense will be affected by among other things the
financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial
performance of its existing companies and cannot be predicted with certainty



recently issued accounting standards

the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial
accounting standards sfas 141  business combinations that applies to all
business combinations completed subsequent to june 30 2001 sfas 141 requires
use of the purchase method for accounting for a business combination other
provisions of sfas 141 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of sfas
142 roper does not expect the full adoption of sfas 141 to significantly affect
its accounting for any business combinations completed prior to june 30 2001

the fasb issued sfas 142  goodwill and other intangible assets that roper
intends to adopt effective november 1 2001 otherwise adoption would be
required on november 1 2002 once adopted this standard provides that
goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization instead

                                       20

page

goodwill will be subjected to a periodic analysis to evaluate possible
impairment any such impairment would be recognized as an expense immediately

the fasb issued sfas 143  accounting for asset retirement obligations that
roper is required to adopt by november 1 2002 roper does not currently have
nor is it expected to have any material asset retirement obligations subject to
this new standard

the fasb issued sfas 144  accounting for the impairment or disposal of
longlived assets that roper is required to adopt by november 1 2002 this new
standard does not apply to goodwill roper does not expect the adoption of this
standard to result in an impairment charge

outlook

fiscal 2002 is expected to be another record year for sales and earnings fiscal
2002 is expected to benefit from the fullyear contributions from the businesses
acquired during fiscal 2001 especially struers and logitech fiscal 2002
earnings would also benefit from the adoption of sfas 142 goodwill amortization
was 157 million during fiscal 2001 the conditions in the semiconductor
industry are currently poor and roper expects its product sales into this
industry to be lower in fiscal 2002 than they were in 2001 on a pro forma basis
roper does not expect this industry to show any significant signs of improvement
before at least the second half of 2002 the terrorist attacks in the united
states on september 11 2001 and the aftereffects related thereto still cast a
significant cloud of uncertainty over the nearterm health of the economy in the
united states and elsewhere the us economy was also showing signs of
weakening prior to the september 11 attacks it is impossible to isolate each of
these factors effects on current economic conditions it is also impossible to
predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what or when any additional
events may occur that also will similarly disrupt the economy

roper expects to continue an active acquisition program however completion of
future acquisitions and their impact on ropers results or financial condition
cannot be accurately predicted

anticipate intend plan foresee likely will or other similar
words or phrases similarly statements that describe ropers objectives plans
or goals are or may be forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking

item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about
            market risk

roper is exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings it is
exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on its transactions denominated in
currencies other than the us dollar it is also exposed to equity market risks
pertaining to the traded price of its common stock

at october 31 2001 roper had a combination of fixedrate borrowings primarily
125 million of term notes and relatively variablerate borrowings primarily
borrowings under the 275 million credit facility although each borrowing
under the 275 million credit facility has a fixed rate the terms of these
individual borrowings are generally only 13 months

at october 31 2001 interest rates were lower than the fixed rates on the term
notes this resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes being
greater than the face amounts of the notes roper estimated this difference to
be 117 million and it represented an unrecorded decrease in ropers net assets
at october 31 2001 if interest rates had been 01 higher the difference
between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have
decreased to 109 million

at october 31 2001 ropers outstanding variablerate borrowings under the 275
million credit facility were 1781 million an increase in interest rates of
01 would increase ropers annualized interest costs by 178000

several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies
other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are
denominated in euros or equivalent currencies british pounds danish krone or
japanese yen

sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were 23 of
ropers total sales the us dollar was mixed against these currencies during
fiscal 2001 comparing currency exchange rates at october 31 2001 to october
31 2000 the dollar weakened 7 against the euro was flat against the pound
and strengthened 11 against yen the dollar strengthened 1 against the krone
over the last two months of fiscal 2001 these exchange rate changes had an
immaterial impact on sales and earnings during fiscal 2001 excluding the
effects of any future acquisitions the percentage of nonus dollar
denominated sales is expected to be higher in fiscal in 2002

the changes of these currencies relative to the us dollar during fiscal 2001
also resulted in an increase in net assets of 12 million that was reported as
a component of comprehensive earnings this change is believed to have a minimal
impact on expected future cash flows

the traded price of ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock
option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed
in ropers financial statements the stock prices also influence the computation
of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted
earnings per share certain cash compensation arrangements are also directly
related to ropers stock price the stock price also affects ropers employees
perceptions of various roper programs that involve its common stock

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk roper is exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings it is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on its transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar it is also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of its common stock 

at october 31 2000 roper had a combination of fixedrate borrowings primarily 125 million of term notes and relatively variablerate borrowings primarily borrowings under the 275 million credit facility although each borrowing under the 275 million credit facility has a fixed rate the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 13 months 

at october 31 2000 interest rates were higher than the fixed rates on the term notes this resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes being less than the face amounts of the notes roper estimated this difference to be 24 million and it represented an unrecorded increase in roper’s net assets at october 31 2000 if interest rates had been 01 higher the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have increased to 32 million 

at october 31 2000 roper’s outstanding variablerate borrowings under the 275 million credit facility were 1076 million an increase in interest rates of 01 would increase roper’s annualized interest costs by 108000 

several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros or equivalent currencies british pounds or japanese yen
