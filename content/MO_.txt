inclusion diversity and equity 

we recognize the critical importance of ide in pursuing our vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures in 2020 we established the following aspirational inclusion  diversity aiming points to help guide our efforts 

▪ be an inclusive place to work for all employees regardless of level demographic group or work function 

▪ have equal numbers of men and women among our vice president and directorlevel employees 

▪ increase our vice president and directorlevel employees who are asian black hispanic or two or more races to at least 30

compensation and benefits 

our compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract retain and motivate strong talent however we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent we work to manage this risk by among other things targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies for which we compete for talent depending on employee level total compensation includes different elements – base salary annual cash incentives longterm equity and cash incentives and benefits our goal is to provide total compensation packages between the 50th and 75th percentiles of total compensation packages paid to employees in comparable positions at our peer companies upon attainment of business and individual goals 

we are committed to pay equity across our companies based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in november 2021 adjusting for factors generally considered to be legitimate differentiators of salary such as performance and tenure salaries of our female employees were 996 of those of our male employees and salaries of our nonwhite employees were 999 of those of our white employees

number of employees and labor relations 

at december 31 2021 we employed approximately 6000 people a decrease from approximately 7100 at december 31 2020 driven by the sale of the wine business thirty percent of our employees were hourly manufacturing employees and members of labor unions subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe we engage and collaborate effectively with our hourly employees as demonstrated by the positive working relationship between our companies and the unions we also have longterm agreements that resolve any collective bargaining dispute through binding arbitration which further demonstrates the trustbased relationship with the unions

we support efforts to address human capital concerns in the tobacco supply chain for example in our domestic tobacco supply chain we use onfarm good agricultural practices assessments to assess growers’ compliance with practices related to labor management our tobacco companies also establish contract terms and conditions with tobacco growers addressing child and forced labor and conduct social compliance audits in highrisk tobacco growing regions

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our results of operations our cash flows our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this form 10k 

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec reports to security holders press releases and investor webcasts and presentations you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans estimates and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this form 10k particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses below in item 7 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

risks related to litigation legislative or regulatory action 

unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees and altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria and its subsidiaries including pm usa as well as their respective indemnitees indemnitors and altria’s investees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability unfair trade practices antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims alleging violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act “rico” claims for contribution and claims of competitors shareholders and distributors legislative action such as changes to tort law also may expand the types of claims and remedies available to plaintiffs 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases have ranged in the billions

of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome 

in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 18 tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation altria its subsidiaries and its investees may face potentially significant nonmonetary remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses for example in the federal government’s lawsuit discussed in note 18 the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” in the patent lawsuit adjudicated before the itc discussed in note 18 the itc banned the importation of the iqos devices marlboro heatsticks and component parts into the united states and the sale and marketing of any such products previously imported into the united states as a result of the itc’s decision pm usa removed the iqos devices marlboro heatsticks and any infringing components from the marketplace 

in 2019 we determined that our investment in juul was impaired in part due to the increase in the number and type of legal cases pending against juul altria and pm usa are also defendants in many of these cases in addition in april 2020 the federal trade commission “ftc” issued an administrative complaint against altria and juul alleging that altria’s 35 investment in juul and the associated agreements constitute unreasonable restraint on trade in february 2022 the administrative law judge dismissed the ftc’s complaint ftc complaint counsel appealed that decision to the ftc commissioners evapor litigation and the ftc action including the remedies the ftc is seeking are further discussed in item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k “item 3” and note 18 

altria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain 

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation in addition an unfavorable outcome in certain pending litigation could adversely affect our ability to achieve our vision altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria to do so see item 3 note 18 and exhibits 991 and 992 to this form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

significant federal state and local governmental actions including actions by the fda and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on altria and its tobacco operating companies’ or its investees’ businesses and sales volumes and on altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

as described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7 pm usa faces significant governmental and private sector actions including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold pm usa responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke these actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels 

more broadly actions by the fda and other federal state or local governments or agencies including those specific actions described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7 may i impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products for example through nicotine or constituent limits or menthol or other flavor bans ii delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk iii limit adult tobacco consumer choices iv require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace for example as a result of a product contamination b legislation and rulemaking that bans menthol or other flavors c a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence d because the fda requires that a currently marketed tobacco product proceed

through the premarket review process or e because the fda does not authorize a pmta or otherwise determines that removal is necessary for the protection of public health v restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers vi restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products vii create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies viii impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements ix interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business x result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products or xi restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies including adversely affecting altria’s investment in juul and altria’s ability to achieve its vision see tobacco space  business environment in item 7 for a more detailed discussion 

tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria’s tobacco operating companies and juul and on altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the federal state and local levels the frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors including federal and state budgets and the composition of executive and legislative bodies tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco operating companies and juul through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult tobacco consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may also have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria’s tobacco operating companies in addition excise taxes on evapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers’ transition to these products which could adversely affect altria’s ability to achieve its vision for further discussion see tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes in item 7 

unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria and its subsidiaries or its investees and altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

from time to time altria its subsidiaries and its investees are subject to federal and state governmental investigations on a range of matters for further discussion of current pending investigations see tobacco space  business environment  other international federal state and local regulation and governmental and private activity in item 7 we cannot predict the outcome of any such investigation and it is possible that our business or the businesses of our subsidiaries and investees and our ability to achieve our vision could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of any current or future investigation 

a challenge to our tax positions an increase in the income tax rate or other changes to federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations a successful challenge to one or more of altria’s tax positions which could give rise to additional liabilities including interest and potential penalties an increase in the corporate income tax rate or other changes to federal or state tax laws including changes to how foreign investments are taxed could adversely affect altria’s earnings or cash flow 

international business operations subject altria its subsidiaries and its investees to various united states and foreign laws and regulations and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

while altria and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as foreign privacy laws the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct for compliance and integrity and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees investees or third parties altria’s investees also engage in international business operations violations of these laws or allegations of such violations by altria its subsidiaries or its investees could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

risks related to business operations 

altria its subsidiaries and its investees face various risks related to health epidemics and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic and similar outbreaks which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies and investees 

altria’s its subsidiaries’ and its investees’ business and financial results consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be negatively impacted by health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks the continuing covid19 pandemic could have negative impacts such as i a global or us recession or other economic crisis including a financial crisis ii credit and capital markets volatility and limited access to these markets including by those in the distribution and supply chains iii significant volatility in demand for our tobacco operating companies’ and investees’ products iv changes in adult tobacco consumer accessibility to those products including due to government action v changes in adult tobacco consumer behavior and preferences including trading down to lowerpriced products or the reduction in or the cessation of product use due to public health actions or concerns and

economic conditions including those stemming from potential changes in government stimulus or reductions in unemployment payments or other benefits and vi extended or multiple disruptions in our tobacco operating companies’ or investees’ manufacturing operations or in their distribution and supply chains in addition our subsidiaries and investees may incur increased costs and otherwise be negatively affected if significant portions of their respective workforces or the workforces within their respective distribution or supply chains are unable to work or work effectively including because of illness unavailability of personal protective equipment quarantines government actions facility closures or other restrictions 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of the outbreak including new variants increases in the number of cases in future periods and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate the public health effects we cannot at this time predict the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our or our investees’ future financial or operational results but the impact could be material over time see the risks below related to extended disruptions at a facility of a distributor or in service by a service provider and the risks related to our investments in juul abi and cronos and the earnings from and carrying value of those investments for further discussion on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our tobacco operating companies and investees see executive summary  covid19 pandemic in item 7 

altria’s tobacco businesses face significant competition including across categories and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria or the business of altria’s tobacco operating companies and on altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

each of altria’s tobacco operating companies operates in highly competitive tobacco categories this competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve significant methods of competition include product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging distribution and promotional activities this highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability market share including as a result of downtrading to lowerpriced competitive brands and shipment volume of altria’s tobacco operating companies which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria see tobacco space  business environment  summary in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences growth of the evapor product category and other innovative tobacco products including oral nicotine pouches has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and in the consumption levels and sales volumes of other tobacco products including mst in addition growth of unregulated synthetic nicotine products which may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions including marketing restrictions and fda premarketing requirements as the tobaccoderived evapor and oral nicotine products of altria’s tobacco operating companies and juul could negatively impact the growth of evapor and oral nicotine pouch products continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies if they are unable to compete effectively directly or through altria’s investments in these innovative product categories which could also negatively impact altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

pm usa also faces competition from lowerpriced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states and as such are not required to make annual settlement payments as required by the parties to the settlements these settlement payments are significant for pm usa as described in liquidity and capital resources  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation in item 7 these settlements among other factors resulted in substantial cigarette price increases to help cover the cost of the settlement payments manufacturers not party to the settlements are subject to state escrow legislation requiring escrow deposits such manufacturers may avoid these escrow obligations by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowerpriced brands 

altria and its tobacco operating companies may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences responding to changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of altria or the business of altria’s tobacco operating companies 

each of our tobacco operating companies is subject to intense competition and changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 

▪ promote brand equity successfully 

▪ anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences 

▪ develop manufacture market and distribute new and innovative products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers including where appropriate through arrangements with or investments in third parties 

▪ improve productivity and 

▪ protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases

see tobacco space  business environment  summary in item 7 and the immediately preceding risk factor for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences specifically the growth of evapor and other innovative tobacco products and the effects on our tobacco operating companies 

the willingness of adult tobacco consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions including inflation in periods of economic uncertainty andor high inflation among other conditions adult tobacco consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products including different categories of tobacco products than those they traditionally purchase which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies while our tobacco operating companies work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products the failure to do so could negatively impact their ability to compete in these circumstances during the second half of 2021 discount cigarette products resumed share growth driven primarily by deep discount products see tobacco space  business environment  summary in item 7 for further discussion of economic conditions including the impact of the current high inflationary environment on our businesses 

altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing innovative products or processes including tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with certain other tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams andor put them at a competitive disadvantage and may also have an adverse effect on altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

altria and its tobacco operating companies have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into innovative products or processes some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with certain other tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences examples include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful such as electronically heated tobacco products oral nicotine pouches and evapor products 

in addition to internal product development these efforts include arrangements with or investments in third parties such as our arrangement with pmi to commercialize iqos devices and related marlboro heatsticks in the united states which is governed by an exclusive license and distribution agreement the iqos devices and related marlboro heatsticks are currently subject to an importation ban and ceaseanddesist orders imposed by the itc pm usa does not expect to have access to iqos devices or the related marlboro heatsticks for sale and distribution during 2022 in addition the initial 5year term of this agreement expires in april 2024 and renews at our option for an additional 5year period so long as we have achieved certain performance objectives the initial term performance objectives are based on achieving 05 dollar share of the cigarette category within a certain period of time in a certain number of geographic areas in addition we maintain our exclusive distribution rights as to pmi during the term of the agreement so long as we have achieved certain performance objectives within a specified time period by april 2022 the exclusive distribution rights performance objectives are based on achieving 05 dollar share of the cigarette category within a certain period of time in a single geographic area while we believe altria has met the initial term and exclusive distribution rights performance objectives pmi has communicated to us that it disagrees as to whether those objectives have been met if we do not resolve this disagreement in a manner favorable to pm usa it could result in the loss of i our unilateral right to extend the agreement for the additional 5year period and therefore we would no longer be able to commercialize iqos devices and related marlboro heatsticks after april 2024 or ii our exclusive distribution rights as to pmi for further discussion see note 18 

additionally our investment in juul subjects us to noncompetition obligations restricting us from investing or engaging in the evapor business other than through juul subject to certain exceptions 

our tobacco operating companies and investees may not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize these innovative products which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams and on our ability to achieve our vision 

further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of any particular innovative products including products with claims of reduced risk to adult tobacco consumers the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products in addition the fda could for a variety of reasons determine that innovative products currently on the market but pending fda review of the associated pmta such as on oral nicotine pouches or those that have previously received authorization including with a claim of reduced exposure such as iqos  are not appropriate for the public health and the fda could require such products be taken off the market see tobacco space  business environment  fsptca and fda regulation in item 7 for further discussion we also cannot predict whether these products will appeal to adult tobacco consumers or whether adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing decisions would be affected by reducedrisk claims on such products if permitted adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products 

if our tobacco operating companies or investees do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products including with claims of reduced risk but one or more of their competitors does succeed our tobacco operating companies or investees may be at a competitive disadvantage which could have an adverse effect on their financial performance and on our ability to achieve our vision

any significant change in prices quality or availability of tobacco other raw materials or component parts including as a result of the covid19 pandemic economic conditions including inflation labor shortages and supply chain disruptions or other factors could adversely affect our tobacco operating companies’ and our investees’ profitability and business as well as their ability to remain compliant with fda and other regulatory requirements for tobacco products for further discussion see tobacco space  business environment  price availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials and component parts in item 7

altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant manufacturing facilities and a small number of key suppliers distributors and distribution chain service providers a natural or manmade disaster cyberincident global pandemic or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria’s tobacco operating companies or investees the operations of any key supplier distributor or distribution chain service provider of any of altria’s tobacco operating companies or investees or any other disruption in the supply or distribution of goods or services including a key supplier’s inability to comply with government regulations lack of available workers or unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries and investees operations of altria’s tobacco operating companies suppliers distributors and distribution chain service providers and those of its investees could be suspended temporarily once or multiple times or closed permanently depending on various factors an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria’s tobacco operating companies investees or in the supply or distribution of goods or services by one or more key suppliers distributors or distribution chain service providers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies and investees 

altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees could decide or be required to recall products which could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria its tobacco operating companies and investees 

in addition to a recall required by the fda as referenced above our tobacco operating companies and investees could decide or other laws or regulations could require them to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria its tobacco operating companies and investees 

the failure of altria’s or its investees’ information systems or service providers’ or key suppliers’ information systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria its subsidiaries or its investees 

altria and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers such as cloud providers to support a variety of business processes and activities including complying with regulatory legal financial reporting and tax requirements engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations manufacturing and distributing our products collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information and communicating internally and externally with employees investors suppliers trade customers adult tobacco consumers and others suppliers and supply chain service providers also rely extensively on information systems we continue to make appropriate investments in administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyberthreats including human error and malicious acts our safeguards include employee training testing and auditing protocols backup systems and business continuity plans maintenance of security policies and procedures monitoring of networks and systems and thirdparty risk management 

from timetotime altria and its suppliers experience attempts to infiltrate and interrupt information systems while infiltration attempts have increased to date interruptions of these information systems as a result of infiltration attempts have not had a material impact on our operations however because technology is increasingly complex and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future failure of altria’s or its investees’ information systems or service providers’ or key suppliers’ information systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws reputational harm to the companies and their brands operational disruptions legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria its subsidiaries and its investees

altria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage tobacco control actions and other factors which could adversely affect altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that may enjoy greater societal acceptance and fewer longerterm challenges as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent in addition our ability to retain the best talent may be adversely affected by current labor market dynamics in which the number of us workers leaving their jobs increased significantly failure to attract and retain the best talent could adversely affect altria’s ability to achieve its vision 

altria may be required to write down intangible assets including goodwill due to impairment which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions such as continued uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences success of planned new product expansions competitive activity and income and excise taxes certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets if an impairment is determined to exist in either situation we will incur impairment losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position for further discussion see discussion and analysis  critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 

risks related to the capital markets and financing 

acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria’s credit rating and altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction 

from time to time altria considers acquisitions investments or dispositions and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition investment disposition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our investment grade credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in juul any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and also may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment additionally there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our businesses or investments on favorable terms which may result in a loss in our consolidated statements of earnings losses 

disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect altria’s access to these markets earnings and dividend rate 

access to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs for example we typically access the commercial paper market early in the second quarter to help fund payments under the master settlement agreement the “msa” tax obligations and shareholder dividends disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability pricing credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

altria may be unable to attract investors due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage 

there is increasing investor focus on environmental social and governance “esg” matters organizations that provide esg information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions decreasing social acceptance of tobacco products or unfavorable esg ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward altria which could result in shareholders choosing to divest their ownership in altria stock or potential investors choosing not to invest in altria stock and could have a negative impact on the market performance of altria stock

a challenge to our investment in juul if successful could result in a broad range of resolutions including divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction 

a challenge to our investment in juul if successful could result in a broad range of resolutions such as divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction in april 2020 the ftc issued an administrative complaint against altria and juul alleging that altria’s 35 investment in juul and the associated agreements constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the sherman act and section 5 of the ftc act and substantially lessened competition in violation of section 7 of the clayton act the ftc seeks a broad range of remedies including divestiture of altria’s investment in juul rescission of the transaction and prohibition against any officer or director of either altria or juul serving on the other’s board of directors or attending meetings the

administrative trial was held before an ftc administrative law judge in june 2021 in february 2022 the administrative law judge dismissed the ftc’s complaint ftc complaint counsel appealed that decision to the ftc commissioners any adverse ruling the ftc commissioners issue following their review may be appealed to a federal appellate court 

also various putative class action lawsuits have been filed against altria and in some cases subsidiaries of altria and juul the lawsuits cite the ftc administrative complaint referenced above and allege claims similar to those made by the ftc plaintiffs in these lawsuits are seeking various remedies including treble damages attorneys’ fees a declaration that the agreements between altria and juul are invalid divestiture of altria’s investment in juul and rescission of the transaction 

a successful challenge by the ftc or the plaintiffs in the lawsuits to the investment would adversely affect us including by eliminating or substantially limiting our rights with respect to our investment in juul and could adversely affect the estimated fair value of our investment for further discussion of the ftc administrative complaint see item 3 and note 18 

the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all 

regardless of whether we successfully defend against the ftc’s challenge to the juul transaction the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all including due to the risks encountered by juul in its business some of which are described in various risk factors above such as operational risks competitive risks and regulatory and legislative risks at the international federal state and local levels including actions by the fda and adverse publicity due to underage use of evapor products and other factors unanticipated impacts on juul’s relationships with employees customers suppliers and other third parties potential disruptions to juul’s management or current or future plans and operations or domestic or international litigation developments investigations or otherwise as discussed in note 18 juul and altria andor its subsidiaries including pm usa are named as defendants in various individual and class action lawsuits including independent lawsuits initiated by certain state attorneys general juul also is named in a significant number of additional individual and class action lawsuits to which neither altria nor its subsidiaries is a party see tobacco space  business environment in item 7 for a discussion of certain fdarelated regulatory risks applicable to the evapor category including the potential removal of certain evapor products from the market as a result of fda enforcement action and the potential denial of new tobacco product applications for evapor products failure to realize the expected benefits of our juul investment could adversely affect the value of the investment and could also adversely affect our ability to achieve our vision 

as discussed in note 6 as part of the preparation of our financial statements for the quarters ended september 30 2019 december 31 2019 and september 30 2020 we performed valuations of our investment in juul as a result of the existence of impairment indicators as a result we determined that our investment in juul was impaired and recorded total noncash pretax impairment charges of 112 billion following share conversion as defined in note 6 in the fourth quarter of 2020 altria elected to account for its equity method investment in juul under the fair value option under this option altria’s consolidated statements of earnings losses include any cash dividends received from its investment in juul and any changes in the estimated fair value of its investment which is calculated quarterly while we believe the december 31 2021 valuation of 17 billion is the appropriate current estimated fair value of our investment the risks identified in this paragraph some of which are also further discussed in discussion and analysis  critical accounting policies and estimates  investment in juul and tobacco space  business environment in item 7 and in note 18 are ongoing with respect to the current estimated fair value quarterly fair value changes could create volatility in altria’s consolidated financial position and earnings and if the estimated fair value of our investment in juul decreases it could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

our investment in juul includes noncompetition standstill and transfer restrictions that prevent us from gaining control of juul furthermore if we elect not to extend our noncompetition obligations beyond december 20 2024 we would lose certain of our governance consent preemptive and other rights with respect to our investment in juul 

the shares of juul we hold generally cannot be sold or otherwise transferred until december 20 2024 subject to limited exceptions we also generally agreed not to compete with juul in the evapor category until at least december 20 2024 which may be extended at our election if however juul is prohibited by federal law from selling evapor products in the united states for at least one year or if altria’s carrying value of the juul investment is not more than 10 of its initial carrying value of 128 billion we may elect to compete with juul in the evapor category prior to december 20 2024 in addition in the event we elect to exercise our board designation rights at juul juul’s board of directors will include nine members three of whom will be designated by altria including one independent designee juul’s strategy and its material decisions are not and will not be controlled by us and the terms of our agreements with juul mean that we are required to bear the risks associated with our investment in juul and are restricted from competing with juul until at least december 20 2024 subject to the exceptions mentioned above further if we elect not to extend our noncompetition obligations beyond that date or to terminate such obligations in the circumstances described above we would lose some or all of our board designation rights preemptive rights consent rights and other rights with respect to our investment in juul

altria’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in abi and the dividends paid by abi on shares owned by altria may be adversely affected by various factors including foreign currency exchange rates and abi’s business results including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and abi’s stock price 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi are translated into us dollars “usd” from various local currencies in addition abi pays dividends in euros which we convert into usd during times of a strengthening usd against these currencies our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer usd and the dividends that we receive from abi will convert into fewer usd dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi are also subject to the risks encountered by abi in its business its business outlook cash flow requirements and financial performance the state of the market and the general economic climate including the impact of the covid19 pandemic for example in 2020 as a result of the uncertainty volatility and impact of the covid19 pandemic on abi’s business abi reduced by 50 its final 2019 dividend paid in the second quarter of 2020 and did not pay its interim 2020 dividend that would have been paid in the fourth quarter of 2020 which resulted in a reduction of cash dividends altria received from abi 

if the carrying value of our investment in abi exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired which would result in additional impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings 

as further discussed in note 6 in preparing our financial statements for the period ended september 30 2021 we concluded that the carrying value of our investment in abi exceeded the fair value of our equity investment in abi and that the decline in fair value of our investment in abi below its carrying value was other than temporary at september 30 2021 as a result we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of 62 billion for the nine and three months ended september 30 2021 to income losses from equity investments in altria’s condensed consolidated statements of earnings losses if abi is unable to successfully execute its business plans and strategies and the carrying value of our investment in abi again exceeds the fair value of our investment in abi it could result in additional impairment losses which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings 

if our percentage ownership in abi were to decrease below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities incur a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the abi board of directors and be unable to account for our investment in abi under the equity method of accounting 

in the event that our ownership percentage in abi were to decrease below certain levels i we may be subject to additional tax liabilities ii the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the abi board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and iii we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in abi under the equity method of accounting 

tax authorities may challenge the tax treatment of the consideration altria received in the october 2016 sabmiller plcabi business combination “abi transaction” and the tax treatment of our investment in abi may not be as favorable as altria anticipates 

while we expect the tax treatment of the consideration that we received from the abi transaction to be respected the statute of limitations for the tax year in which the transaction occurred has not expired therefore we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and if they do what the outcome of any such challenge will be in addition there is a risk that the tax treatment of our investment in abi may not be as favorable as we anticipate 

the expected benefits of the cronos transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all 

in march 2019 we acquired common shares representing a 45 equity interest in cronos a warrant to acquire common shares representing an additional 10 equity interest in cronos and antidilution protections to purchase cronos shares to maintain our ownership percentage there can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits of the cronos transaction including due to the risks encountered by cronos in its business some of which are described in various risk factors above such as operational risks and legal and regulatory risks unanticipated impacts on cronos’s relationships with third parties its management or its current or future plans and operations due to the cronos transaction or other factors or domestic or international litigation developments tax disputes investigations or otherwise or that cronos will successfully execute its business plans and strategies further a failure by cronos or altria to comply with applicable laws including cannabis laws could result in criminal civil or tax liability or reputational harm for altria 

if the carrying value of our investment in cronos exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or earnings 

as further discussed in note 6 in preparing our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 we concluded that our equity method investment in cronos declined below its carrying value and that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the impairment was temporary as a result we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of  205 million to income losses from equity investments in our consolidated statement of earnings losses for the year ended december 31 2021 if cronos is unable to

as with so many other companies throughout the united states and globally altria’s operations have been affected by the covid19 pandemic to date altria believes its tobacco businesses have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations but continues to monitor these factors altria continues to operate in a remote working environment for many employees and believes that remote working due to the covid19 pandemic has had minimal impact on productivity also altria’s critical information technology systems have remained operational although altria’s tobacco businesses previously suspended operations temporarily at several of their manufacturing facilities in march 2020 the businesses resumed operations at those facilities under enhanced safety protocols in april 2020 and all manufacturing and nonmanufacturing facilities are currently operational under enhanced safety protocols recommended by public health authorities altria continues to monitor the risks associated with facility disruptions and workforce availability as a result of uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic and guidance from public health officials as it evolves its safety protocols 

altria also continues to monitor the inflationary environment arising in part from the covid19 pandemic and its impact on altria’s financial position and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 inflation did not have a material impact on altria’s msa expense or on direct materials and other costs while altria anticipates that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022 it does not believe the impacts will be material to altria’s financial position and results of operations see operating results by business segment  tobacco space  state settlement agreements below for further discussion on msa expense

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in net earnings losses attributable to altria and diluted earnings losses per share “eps” attributable to altria for the year ended december 31 2021 from the year ended december 31 2020 were due primarily to the following 



for a discussion of special items and other business drivers affecting the comparability of statements of earnings losses amounts and reconciliations of adjusted earnings attributable to altria and adjusted diluted eps attributable to altria see the consolidated operating results section below 

▪ fewer shares outstanding fewer shares outstanding were due to shares repurchased by altria under its share repurchase program in 2021 

▪ change in tax rate the change in the tax rate which excludes the impact of special items shown in the table above was driven primarily by a higher foreign tax rate differential and higher state tax expense 

▪ operations the increase of 435 million in operations which excludes the impact of special items shown above was due primarily to the following 

▪ higher oci from the smokeable products segment 

▪ lower losses in the all other category primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual values of certain assets at pmcc in 2020

▪ favorable net periodic benefit income excluding service cost and 

▪ higher income from altria’s equity investment in abi

2022 forecasted results 

altria expects its 2022 fullyear adjusted diluted eps to be in a range of 479 to 493 representing a growth rate of 4 to 7 over its 2021 fullyear adjusted diluted eps of 461 as shown in the table below altria expects 2022 adjusted diluted eps growth to be weighted toward the second half of the year while the 2022 fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance accounts for a range of scenarios the external environment remains dynamic altria will continue to monitor conditions related to i the economy including the impact of increased inflation ii the impact of current and future covid19 variants and mitigation strategies iii adult tobacco consumer dynamics including tobacco usage occasions available disposable income purchasing patterns and adoption of smokefree products and iv regulatory and legislative developments 

altria’s 2022 fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance range includes planned investments in support of its vision such as i costs to enhance its digital consumer engagement system ii increased smokefree product research development and regulatory preparation expenses and iii marketplace activities in support of altria’s smokefree products the guidance range also includes anticipated inflationary increases in msa expenses and direct materials costs and altria’s current expectation that pm usa will not have access to the iqos system in 2022 

altria expects its 2022 fullyear adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of 245 to 255 



for a discussion of certain income and expense items excluded from the forecasted results above see the consolidated operating results section below 

altria’s fullyear adjusted diluted eps forecast and fullyear forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items including those items noted in the nongaap financial measures section below that management believes are not part of underlying operations altria’s management cannot estimate on a forwardlooking basis the impact of these items on its reported diluted eps or its reported effective tax rate because these items which could be significant may be unusual or infrequent are difficult to predict and may be highly variable as a result altria does not provide a corresponding gaap measure for or reconciliation to its adjusted diluted eps forecast or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast 

nongaap financial measures 

while altria reports its financial results in accordance with gaap its management also reviews certain financial results including oci oci margins net earnings losses attributable to altria and diluted eps on an adjusted basis which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example loss on early extinguishment of debt restructuring charges asset impairment charges acquisitionrelated and dispositionrelated costs covid19 special items equity investmentrelated special items including any changes in fair value of the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights certain tax items charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items and resolutions of certain nonparticipating manufacturer “npm” adjustment disputes under the msa such dispute resolutions are referred to as “npm adjustment items” altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria’s underlying results as they may be highly variable may be unusual or infrequent are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis altria’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate 

altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets these adjusted financial measures are not required by or calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ revenue recognition altria’s businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers net revenues are defined as revenues which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers net of cash discounts for prompt payment sales returns also referred to as returned goods and sales incentives altria’s businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and valueadded taxes imposed at the time of sale 

altria’s businesses record sales incentives which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities as a reduction to revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers retailers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical volume utilization and redemption rates expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets 

for further discussion see note 3 revenues from contracts with customers to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if altria determines that an impairment exists any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

altria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria to perform an interim review altria has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test if necessary altria will perform a single step quantitative impairment test additionally altria has the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment if the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit but is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified 

t able of contents 

goodwill by reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible assets at december 31 2021 were as follows 



during 2021 altria completed its annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets performed as of october 1 2021 and the results of this testing were as follows 

▪ no impairment charges were recorded and 

▪ the estimated fair values of all reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets within all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

during 2020 altria’s quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges for further discussion on goodwill see note 4 goodwill and other intangible assets net to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 4 ”  

in 2021 altria elected to perform a qualitative assessment for certain of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value for certain of its other reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets altria elected to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment altria used an income approach to estimate the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the weightedaverage discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10 

in performing the 2021 discounted cash flow analysis altria made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria’s longterm financial forecast which is used by altria’s management to evaluate business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria’s indefinitelived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2 fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria’s control 

although altria’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions such as continued uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic federal state and local regulatory developments category growth rates consumer preferences success of planned new product expansions competitive activity and income and excise taxes for further discussion of these factors see operating results by business segment  tobacco space  business environment below 

while altria’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset at december 31 2021 are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4 

▪ investments in equity securities altria reviews its equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting abi and cronos for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of its investments to their carrying value if the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired and reduced to fair value and the impairment is recognized in the period identified the factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and altria’s intent and ability to hold its investment until recovery 

following share conversion as defined in note 6 in the fourth quarter of 2020 altria elected to account for its equity investment in juul under the fair value option under this option any cash dividends received and any changes in the fair value of the equity investment in juul which is calculated quarterly using level 3 fair value measurements are included in income losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings losses

investment in abi 

at december 31 2021 altria’s investment in abi consisted of 185 million restricted shares of abi the “restricted shares” and 12 million ordinary shares of abi the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi is based on i unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for abi’s ordinary shares and was classified in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and ii observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets for the restricted shares and was classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy altria can convert its restricted shares to ordinary shares at its discretion therefore the fair value of each restricted share is based on the value of an ordinary share 

the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 119 billion carrying value of 111 billion and 138 billion carrying value of 167 billion respectively which was above its carrying value by approximately 7 at december 31 2021 and less than its carrying value by approximately 17 at december 31 2020 

in october 2019 the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi declined below its carrying value and at september 30 2021 had not recovered in preparing its financial statements for the period ended september 30 2021 altria evaluated the factors related to the fair value decline including the impact on the fair value of abi’s shares during the covid19 pandemic which has negatively impacted abi’s business altria evaluated the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline at september 30 2021 abi’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and altria’s intent and ability to hold its investment in abi until recovery  altria concluded that the decline in fair value of its investment in abi at september 30 2021 was other than temporary as a result altria recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of 62 billion during the third quarter of 2021 which was recorded to income losses from equity investments in its condensed consolidated statements of earnings losses this impairment charge reflected the difference between the fair value using abi’s share price at september 30 2021 and the carrying value of altria’s equity investment in abi at september 30 2021 prior to recording the impairment charge this conclusion was based on the following factors 

▪ the fair value of altria’s investment in abi had been below its carrying value since october 2019 and had not fully recovered at its lowest point in march 2020 the fair value of altria’s investment in abi was below its carrying value by approximately 52 and at december 31 2020 had recovered to approximately 17 below its carrying value during the first nine months of 2021 abi’s share price continued to fluctuate ultimately resulting in a share price decline of 18 since december 31 2020 at september 30 2021 prior to recording the impairment charge the fair value of altria’s investment in abi was below its carrying value by approximately 35 

▪ the fair value of altria’s investment in abi historically exceeded its carrying value since october 2016 when altria obtained its ownership interest in abi with the exception of certain periods starting in september 2018 and since october 2019 altria was optimistic about a nearterm recovery because abi’s share price demonstrated significant recovery including during 2019 the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021 however during the third quarter of 2021 the decline in abi’s share price resumed and at september 30 2021 the share price was lower than at december 31 2020 erasing much of the recovery experienced in the second half of 2020 and first half of 2021 

▪ abi’s share price continued to decline following the release of abi’s second quarter of 2021 earnings report in which abi’s performance in the first half of 2021 improved meaningfully versus the same period in 2020 despite abi’s second quarter of 2021 results which also included topline growth ahead of the prepandemic levels from the second quarter of 2019 as well as the reaffirmation of its 2021 outlook abi’s income growth was impacted by among other things transactional foreign exchange and commodity cost headwinds and 

▪ the industry disruption and volatility associated with the covid19 pandemic including the impact of covid19 variants and related cost headwinds have continued while altria continues to believe that abi’s share price performance is not reflective of its underlying longterm equity value and abi’s share price will recover altria determined that it will take longer than previously expected as altria believes that covid19 variants supplychain constraints across certain markets transactional foreign exchange and commodity cost headwinds may continue to impact abi’s nearterm financial results and share price performance 

although altria recorded an impairment charge on its investment in abi during the third quarter of 2021 altria continues to have confidence in abi’s i longterm strategies ii premium global brands iii experienced management team and iv capability to successfully navigate its nearterm challenges while altria considers the impacts related to the covid19 pandemic that have negatively impacted abi’s global business to be transitory altria determined as of the third quarter of 2021 that the full recovery to carrying value would take longer than previously expected 

at february 22 2022 the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi was 122 billion which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9 altria will continue to monitor its investment in abi including the impact of the covid19 pandemic and subsequent recovery on abi’s business and market valuation

investment in juul 

at december 31 2021 the estimated fair value of altria’s investment in juul was 17 billion unchanged from december 31 2020 as altria’s projections of lower juul revenues in the united states over time due to lower juul volume assumptions were offset by i the effect of passage of time on the projected cash flows and ii a decrease in the discount rate due to change in market factors 

altria uses an income approach to estimate the fair value of its investment in juul the income approach reflects the discounting of future cash flows for the united states and international markets at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing future cash flows future cash flows are based on a range of scenarios that consider various potential regulatory and market outcomes 

in determining the fair value of its investment in juul in 2021 altria made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were sales volume operating margins discount rates and perpetual growth rates all significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 170 to 190 at december 31 2021 the perpetual growth rates used in performing each valuation ranged from 05 to 00 additionally in determining these significant assumptions altria made judgments regarding the i likelihood and extent of various potential regulatory actions and the continued adverse public perception impacting the evapor category and specifically juul ii risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against juul iii expectations for the future state of the evapor category including competitive dynamics and iv timing of international expansion plans 

although altria’s discounted cash flow analyses were based on assumptions that altria’s management considered reasonable and were based on the best available information at the time that the analyses were developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows if the following factors in isolation significantly deviate from current expectations altria believes that they have the potential to materially impact altria’s significant assumptions of sales volume operating margins discount rate and perpetual growth rate thus potentially materially decreasing altria’s valuation of its investment in juul 

▪ adverse developments related to litigation 

▪ a successful challenge by the ftc in its administrative complaint against altria and juul for a further discussion see item 3 and note 18 

▪ a substantial increase in state and federal evapor excise taxes 

▪ adverse publicity due to underage use of evapor products and other factors 

▪ supply chain constraints and component part shortages if not transitory 

▪ unanticipated adverse impacts on juul’s relationships with employees customers suppliers and other third parties 

▪ unfavorable financial and market performance including substantial changes in competitive dynamics 

▪ delay in timing of international expansion plans 

▪ disruption in juul’s current and future plans or operations in domestic and international markets and 

▪ unfavorable regulatory and legislative developments at the international federal state and local levels such as the potential removal of certain evapor products from the market as a result of fda enforcement action or the potential denial of new tobacco product applications for evapor products 

if the following factors in isolation significantly deviate from current expectations altria believes that they have the potential to materially impact altria’s significant assumptions of sales volume operating margins discount rate and perpetual growth rate thus potentially materially increasing altria’s valuation of its investment in juul 

▪ favorable developments related to litigation 

▪ favorable financial and market performance including substantial changes in competitive dynamics 

▪ improvement of public perception around juul and the evapor category and 

▪ favorable regulatory and legislative developments at the international federal state and local levels such as fda authorization of future tobacco product applications for juul flavored evapor products which are currently not permitted in the market without authorization 

while altria’s management believes that the recorded value of its investment in juul at december 31 2021 represents its best estimate of the fair value of the investment juul’s actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance due to changes in the factors noted above additionally the value of altria’s investment in juul could be significantly impacted by changes in the discount rate which could be caused by numerous factors including changes in market inputs as well as risks specific to juul and its litigation environment 

investment in cronos 

the fair value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for cronos’s common shares and was classified in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy the fair value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos 

t able of contents 

at december 31 2020 was 11 billion carrying value of 10 billion which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 8 at december 31 2020 

in september 2021 the fair value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos declined below its carrying value by approximately 2 as of september 30 2021 and had not recovered as of december 31 2021 accounting guidance requires the evaluation of the following factors when determining if the decline in fair value is other than temporary i the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline ii the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and iii the investor’s intent and ability to hold its equity method investment until full recovery to its carrying value in the nearterm in preparing its financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 altria evaluated these factors and determined that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the impairment was temporary as a result altria recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of 205 million for the year ended december 31 2021 which was recorded to income losses from equity investments in its consolidated statement of earnings losses the impairment charge reflects the difference between the fair value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos using cronos’s share price at december 31 2021 and the carrying value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos at december 31 2021 at december 31 2021 prior to recording the impairment charge the fair value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos was less than its carrying value by approximately 25 after recording the impairment charge the fair value and carrying value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos at december 31 2021 were 617 million 

at february 22 2022 the fair value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos was 524 million which was less than its carrying value by approximately 15 altria will continue to assess the fair value of its equity method investment in cronos to determine if any decline in fair value below its carrying value is other than temporary 

for further discussion of altria’s investments in abi juul and cronos see note 6 

▪ marketing costs altria’s businesses promote their products with consumer incentives trade promotions and consumer engagement programs these consumer incentive and trade promotion activities which include discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives do not create a distinct deliverable and are therefore recorded as a reduction of revenues consumer engagement program payments are made to third parties altria’s businesses expense these consumer engagement programs which include event marketing as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing administration and research costs in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings losses for interim reporting purposes altria’s businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies as discussed in note 18 and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various us and foreign jurisdictions against altria and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees and altria’s investees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due in addition pm usa middleton and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume operating income market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales altria’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 46 billion and 47 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees 

altria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except to the extent discussed in note 18 and item 3 i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any pending litigation ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any pending case and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings losses 

▪ employee benefit plans altria provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees including pension postretirement health care and postemployment benefits altria records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets mortality compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service 

t able of contents 

costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost income the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings losses are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost income in future years 

due to changes in market inputs altria’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations increased to 30 and 29 respectively at december 31 2021 from 27 and 26 respectively at december 31 2020 altria presently anticipates net pretax pension and postretirement income of 103 million in 2022 versus net pretax income of 114 million in 2021 excluding amounts in each year related to settlement and curtailment this anticipated change is due primarily to i lower expected return on plan assets due to the change in the target asset allocation for its pension plan assets for 2022 which lowered the expected rate of return from 66 in 2021 to 61 in 2022 ii higher interest costs driven by the impact of higher discount rates and iii lower amortization of unrecognized losses primarily driven by the impact of higher discount rates and changes to mortality rate assumptions assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve a 50 basis point decrease increase in altria’s discount rates would increase decrease altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 10 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 40 million

▪ income taxes significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized in reaching this determination altria considers all available positive and negative evidence including the character of the loss carryback and carryforward considerations future reversals of temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 

altria recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings losses

2021 compared with 2020 

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers decreased 140 million 05 due primarily to lower net revenues in the smokeable products and wine segments resulting from the sale of the wine business in october 2021 partially offset by higher net revenues in the financial services business primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual values of certain assets at pmcc in 2020 and the oral tobacco products segment

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the us tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees and altria’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position or altria’s ability to achieve its vision these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail in note 18 item 1a and item 3 include 

▪ pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements 

▪ restrictions and requirements imposed by the fsptca and restrictions and requirements and related enforcement actions that have been and in the future will be imposed by the fda 

▪ actual and proposed excise tax increases as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements 

▪ bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers 

▪ other federal state and local government actions including 

▪ restrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes 

▪ additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products 

▪ other actual and proposed tobaccorelated legislation and regulation and 

▪ governmental investigations 

▪ reductions in cigarette and mst consumption levels due to growth of innovative tobacco products 

▪ increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities including retail establishments to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products 

▪ changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior which is influenced by various factors such as economic conditions including inflation excise taxes and price gap relationships may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to discount products or other lowerpriced tobacco products 

▪ the highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories including competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products such as evapor and oral nicotine pouch products 

▪ illicit trade in tobacco products 

▪ potential adverse changes in prices availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials and component parts and 

▪ the covid19 pandemic 

in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences are continuing to impact the tobacco industry altria’s tobacco operating companies believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch among tobacco 

t able of contents 

categories use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products such as evapor products and oral nicotine pouches adult smokers continue to transition from cigarettes to exclusive use of smokefree tobacco product alternatives which aligns with altria’s vision 

altria and its tobacco operating companies work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the united states through innovation and other growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties 

over the past two years the legislative and regulatory activities discussed below negatively impacted growth in the evapor category while these activities continue to impact the evapor category the category experienced moderate growth in 2021 and remains competitive 

oral nicotine pouch retail share of the total oral tobacco category grew significantly over the prior year from 84 during 2020 to 154 during 2021 the oral nicotine pouch category has become increasingly competitive 

we are monitoring the sale and continued introduction of unregulated synthetic nicotine products which may lead to further competition for regulated tobacco products including oral nicotine pouches and evapor products and may result in underage use of these unregulated products if not marketed responsibly by manufacturers 

altria and its tobacco operating companies believe the innovative tobacco products categories will continue to be dynamic due to competition adult tobacco consumer exploration of a variety of tobacco product options adult consumer perceptions of the relative risks of smokefree products compared to cigarettes fda determinations on product applications and legislative actions 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we estimate that when adjusted for trade inventory movements calendar differences and other factors domestic cigarette industry volume declined by 55 altria expects 2022 cigarette industry volume trends to continue to be most influenced by i changes to adult smoker stayathome practices disposable income purchasing patterns and adoption of smokefree products ii economic conditions including unemployment rates the impact of increased inflation and gasoline prices iii fiscal stimulus iv crosscategory movement v the timing and extent of covid19 vaccine administration and the impact of covid19 variants and vi regulatory and legislative including excise tax developments 

economic conditions including a high inflationary environment can also impact adult tobacco consumer purchasing behavior for example economic downturns have resulted in adult tobacco consumers choosing discount products and other lower priced tobacco products although the economic impact resulting from the covid19 pandemic did not meaningfully increase the growth of discount and lower priced tobacco products throughout much of the pandemic in part due to stimulus payments discount cigarette products resumed share growth in the second half of 2021 driven primarily by deep discount products share gains for discount cigarette products typically coincide with rising gas prices higher inflation and increased consumer mobility we expect fluctuations in discount cigarette product segment share to continue as price sensitive adult tobacco consumers react to economic conditions in the current high inflationary environment 

fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca its implementing regulations and its 2016 deeming regulations establish broad fda regulatory authority over all tobacco products and among other provisions 

▪ impose restrictions on the advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products see final tobacco marketing rule below 

▪ establish premarket review pathways for new and modified tobacco products see premarket review pathways for tobacco products and market authorization enforcement below 

▪ prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without fda authorization 

▪ authorize the fda to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health and 

▪ equip the fda with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities 

the fsptca also bans descriptors such as “light” “low” or “mild” when used as descriptors of modified risk unless expressly authorized by the fda in connection with a 2016 lawsuit initiated by middleton the department of justice on behalf of the fda informed middleton that the fda does not intend to bring an enforcement action against middleton for the use of the term “mild” in the trademark “black  mild” consequently middleton dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice if the fda were to change its position at some later date middleton would have the opportunity to bring another lawsuit 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca in march 2010 the fda promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco 1 products the “final tobacco marketing rule” the may 

1 “smokeless tobacco” as used in this section of this form 10k refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the fda in 2009 including mst it excludes oral nicotine pouches which were first regulated by the fda in 2016 

t able of contents 

2016 deeming regulations amended the final tobacco marketing rule to expand specific provisions to all tobacco products including cigars pipe tobacco and evapor and oral nicotine products containing tobaccoderived nicotine or other tobacco derivatives but do not include any component or part that is not made or derived from tobacco 

the final tobacco marketing rule as amended among other things 

▪ restricts the use of nontobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products 

▪ prohibits sampling of all tobacco products except that sampling of smokeless tobacco products is permitted in qualified adultonly facilities 

▪ prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos 

▪ prohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic musical artistic or other social or cultural event or any entry or team in any event and 

▪ requires the development by the fda of graphic warnings for cigarettes establishes warning requirements for other tobacco products and gives the fda the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco product see fda regulatory actions  graphic warnings below 

subject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for all other tobacco products including evapor and oral nicotine pouch products containing tobaccoderived nicotine 

▪ rulemaking and guidance from time to time the fda issues proposed regulations and guidance which may be issued in draft or final form generally involve public comment and may include scientific review the fda also may request comments on broad topics through an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking “anprm” altria’s tobacco operating companies actively engage with the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

the fda’s implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by united states states territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect the ability of altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ fda’s comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation in july 2017 the fda announced a “comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation” “comprehensive plan” designed to strike a balance between regulation and encouraging the development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes since then the fda has issued additional information about its comprehensive plan in response to concerns associated with the rise in the use of evapor products by youth and the potential youth appeal of flavored tobacco products see underage access and use of certain tobacco products below as part of the comprehensive plan the fda 

▪ issued anprms relating to potential product standards for nicotine in cigarettes flavors in all tobacco products including menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in all cigars and for evapor products to protect against known public health risks such as concerns about youth exposure to liquid nicotine 

▪ took actions to restrict youth access to evapor products and 

▪ reconsidered the processes used by the fda to review certain reports and new product applications 

▪ premarket review pathways for tobacco products and market authorization enforcement the fsptca permits the sale of tobacco products on the market as of february 15 2007 and not subsequently modified “grandfathered products” and new or modified products authorized through the pmta substantial equivalence “se” or se exemption pathways subsequent fda rules also provide a supplemental pmta pathway designed to increase the efficiency of submission and review for modified versions of previously authorized products 

the fda premarket authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability in the market specifically 

▪ grandfathered products are exempt from the premarket authorization requirement 

▪ cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and march 22 2011 are generally considered “provisional products” for which se reports were required to be filed by march 22 2011 these reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of february 15 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health and 

▪ tobacco products that were first regulated by the fda in 2016 including cigars evapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not grandfathered products are generally products for which either an se report or pmta needed to be filed by september 9 2020

modifications to currently marketed products including modifications that result from for example changes to the quantity of tobacco products in a package a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients could trigger the fda’s premarket or se review processes through these processes a manufacturer could receive i a “not substantially equivalent” determination ii a denial of a pmta or iii a marketing order withdrawal by the fda on one or more products which would require the removal of the product or products from the market such actions could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees and the cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

provisional products  most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by pm usa and usstc are “provisional products” altria’s subsidiaries timely submitted se reports for these provisional products pm usa and usstc have received se determinations on certain provisional products those products that were found by the fda to be not substantially equivalent certain smokeless tobacco products had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the fda’s determinations therefore those determinations did not impact business results pm usa and usstc have other provisional products that continue to be subject to the fda’s premarket review process in the meantime they can continue marketing these products unless the fda determines that a specific provisional product is not substantially equivalent 

in addition the fda has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of provisional product se reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can continue to be legally marketed without further fda review pm usa and usstc have provisional products included in this subset of products 

while altria’s cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies believe their current provisional products meet the statutory requirements of the fsptca they cannot predict how the fda will ultimately apply law regulation and guidance to their various se reports should altria’s cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies receive unfavorable determinations on any se reports currently pending with the fda they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other fda authorized products or with grandfathered products 

nonprovisional products  cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after march 22 2011 are “nonprovisional products” and must receive a marketing order from the fda prior to being offered for sale marketing orders for nonprovisional products may be obtained by filing an se report pmta or using another premarket pathway established by the fda altria’s cigarette and smokeless tobacco operating companies may not be able to obtain a marketing order for nonprovisional products because the fda may determine that any such product does not meet the statutory requirements for approval 

products regulated in 2016  manufacturers of products first regulated by the fda in 2016 including cigars oral nicotine pouches and evapor products that were on the market as of august 8 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an se report or pmta by the filing deadline of september 9 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market these products can remain on the market during fda review through courtallowed casebycase discretion so long as the report or application was timely filed with the fda due to the large number of applications received by september 9 2020 the fda did not complete its review of all submitted applications by september 9 2021 although it represents that it has made decisions on more than 98 of the applications with most being marketing denial orders and a few marketing granted orders for tobacco flavor evapor products a number of the marketing denial orders are subject to litigation challenges initiated by the affected manufacturers for those products still under fda review it is uncertain when and for how long the fda may permit continued marketing and sale of those products pursuant to its casebycase discretion for products new or modified not on the market as of august 8 2016 manufacturers must file an se report or pmta and receive fda authorization prior to marketing and selling the product 

helix submitted pmtas for on oral nicotine pouches in may 2020 juul submitted pmtas to the fda for its evapor device and the related tobacco and menthol flavors in july 2020 as of february 22 2022 the fda has not issued marketing order decisions for any on or juul products in addition as of february 22 2022 middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 99 of its cigar product volume 

in december 2013 altria’s subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with pmi including an agreement that grants altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of pmi’s heated tobacco products in the united states subject to fda authorization of the applicable products pmi submitted a pmta and a mrtp application with the fda for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the iqos tobacco heating system  the iqos devices heat but do not burn tobacco in april 2019 the fda authorized the pmta for the iqos tobacco heating system and in july 2020 the fda authorized the marketing of this system as a mrtp with a reduced exposure claim in december 2020 the fda authorized the pmta for iqos 3 an updated version of the iqos devices the mrtp authorization for the original iqos device currently does not apply to the iqos 3 device pmi submitted an mrtp application for the iqos 3 device in march 2021 which is currently under review by the fda 

in september 2021 in connection with a patent dispute the itc issued a cease and desist order effective as of november 29 2021 banning i the importation of the iqos devices marlboro heatsticks and infringing components into the united states and ii the sale marketing and distribution of such imported products in the united states as a result pm usa removed the products from the

marketplace for a further discussion of the itc decision see note 18 for a further discussion of risks associated with the agreements with pmi see risks related to our businesses in item 1a 

in october 2021 the fda authorized the marketing and sale of four of usstc’s verve oral nicotine products including green mint and blue mint varieties representing the first flavored product authorizations issued by the fda for newly deemed innovative products these products are not currently marketed or sold 

postmarket surveillance  manufacturers that receive product authorizations through the pmta process must submit to the fda postmarket records and reports as detailed in market orders this includes notification of all marketing activities the iqos tobacco heating system is subject to this postmarket surveillance requirement the fda may amend requirements of a market order or withdraw the market order based on this information if among other reasons it determines that the continued marketing of the products is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health 

effect of adverse fda determinations  fda review time frames have varied it is therefore difficult to predict the duration of fda reviews of se reports or pmtas failure of manufacturers to submit applications by the applicable deadline an unfavorable determination on an application or the withdrawal by the fda of a prior marketing order could result in the removal of products from the market these manufacturers would have the option of marketing products that have received fda premarket authorization or grandfathered products a “not substantially equivalent” determination a denial of a pmta or a marketing order withdrawal by the fda on one or more products which would require the removal of the product or products from the market could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of our tobacco operating companies and investees and the cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul also an adverse fda determination on one or more innovative tobacco products could impede our ability to achieve our vision 

▪ fda regulatory actions 

▪ graphic warnings  in march 2020 the fda issued a final rule requiring 11 textual warnings accompanied by color graphics depicting certain negative health consequences of smoking on cigarette packaging and advertising as a result of a march 2021 court order related to the covid19 pandemic and subsequent court orders resulting from a lawsuit brought by rj reynolds tobacco company and others against the fda the final rule is presently anticipated to become effective on april 9 2023 pm usa and other cigarette manufacturers have filed lawsuits challenging the final rule on substantive and procedural grounds 

in the preamble to the final rule the fda stated that it would not exempt marlboro heatsticks  a heated tobacco product used with the iqos devices as part of the rulemaking but would consider the marlboro heatsticks marketing order and other marketing orders on a casebycase basis to date the fda has not taken any action to exempt marlboro heatsticks from the graphic health warnings requirements 

▪ underage access and use of certain tobacco products  the fda announced regulatory actions in september 2018 to address underage access and use of evapor products altria has engaged with the fda on this topic and has reaffirmed to the fda its ongoing and longstanding commitment to preventing underage use for example during 2019 altria advocated raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels to further address underage use which is now federal law see federal state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products below for further discussion 

additionally the fda issued final guidance in april 2020 stating that it intends to prioritize enforcement action against certain product categories including cartridgebased flavored evapor products and products targeted to minors 

▪ flavored electronic nicotine delivery system “ends” products some evapor product manufacturers filed pmtas for flavored tobacco products as of february 22 2022 many of these manufacturers received marketing denial orders for failure to provide sufficiently strong productspecific scientific evidence to demonstrate that the benefit of their products to adult smokers overcomes the risk that their products pose to youth fda has communicated in these marketing denial orders that vapor products with nontobacco flavors present unique questions relevant to the fda’s “appropriate for the protection of public health” standard and that successful applications will require strong productspecific evidence a number of manufacturers are appealing the marketing denial orders for their products if the fda does not ultimately allow for the reintroduction of flavors other than tobacco it could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul 

some ends manufacturers including some that have received marketing denial orders have indicated their intention to market ends products containing syntheticallyderived nicotine which is not currently fdaregulated if these products are sold in higher volumes and marketed outside of fda oversight it could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings and adversely affect altria’s ability to achieve its vision

▪ potential product standards 

▪ nicotine in cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products  in march 2018 the fda issued an anprm seeking comments on the potential public health benefits and any possible adverse effects of lowering nicotine in combustible cigarettes to nonaddictive or minimally addictive levels among other issues the fda sought comments on i whether smokers would compensate by smoking more cigarettes to obtain the same level of nicotine as with their current product and ii whether the proposed rule would create an illicit trade of cigarettes containing nicotine at levels higher than a nonaddictive threshold that may be established by the fda the fda also sought comments on whether a nicotine product standard should apply to other combustible tobacco products including cigars were the fda to develop and finalize a product standard for nicotine in combustible products and if the standard was appealed and upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies 

▪ flavors in tobacco products  as discussed above under fda’s comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation  the fda indicated that it is considering proposing rulemaking for a product standard that would seek to ban menthol in combustible tobacco products including cigarettes and cigars and that it intends to propose a product standard that would ban characterizing flavors in all cigars including grandfathered products and those that have received se determinations from the fda  an intention reiterated in the fda’s january 2020 guidance in march 2018 the fda issued an anprm seeking comments on the role if any that flavors including menthol in tobacco products may play in attracting youth and in helping some smokers switch to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery in the context of litigation in april 2021 the fda issued a response to a 2013 citizen petition requesting that the fda prohibit menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes in the response the fda announced it intends to develop and propose two product standards which are expected by the second quarter of 2022 that would i ban menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and ii ban all characterizing flavors including menthol in cigars while the fda has yet to define “characterizing flavors” with respect to cigars most of middleton’s cigar products contain added flavors and may be subject to any action by the fda to ban flavors in cigars 

if any such product standards become final and are appealed and upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business of altria’s tobacco operating companies and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul due to the impact on juul’s business if the fda pursues broader flavor restrictions beyond cigarettes and cigars 

▪ nnn in smokeless tobacco  in january 2017 the fda proposed a product standard for nnitrosonornicotine “nnn” levels in finished smokeless tobacco products if the proposed rule in present form were to become final and was appealed and upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and usstc 

▪ good manufacturing practices the fsptca requires that the fda promulgate good manufacturing practice regulations referred to by the fda as “requirements for tobacco product manufacturing practice” for tobacco product manufacturers but does not specify a timeframe for such regulations compliance with any such regulations could result in increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of altria its tobacco operating companies and its investees including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs and user fees fda regulatory actions under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies in various ways for example actions by the fda could 

▪ impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products 

▪ delay discontinue or prevent the sale or distribution of existing new or modified tobacco products 

▪ limit adult tobacco consumer choices 

▪ impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers 

▪ create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies 

▪ impose additional manufacturing labeling or packaging requirements 

▪ impose additional restrictions at retail 

▪ result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products andor 

▪ otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business 

the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions also could have a material adverse effect on the business of altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

the fsptca imposes user fees on cigarette cigarette tobacco smokeless tobacco cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the fsptca does not impose user fees on evapor or oral nicotine pouch

manufacturers the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares all as prescribed by the fsptca and fda regulations payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors including market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the fda user fee payments on altria see liquidity and capital resources  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for altria’s tobacco operating companies the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material either individually or in the aggregate to one or more of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings monetary penalties product withdrawal and recall orders and product seizures investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business of altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the united states the frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors including the composition of executive and legislative bodies 

during 2021 congress considered legislation that would have significantly increased the federal excise tax for all tobacco products and created a new tax for evapor products and other products containing nicotine that are not currently subject to a tobacco federal excise tax “novel tobacco products” the us house of representatives removed the proposal to increase the federal excise tax on tobacco products currently subject to the tax from the legislation it was considering but retained the proposed nicotine tax for novel tobacco products the us senate debated the legislation and removed the nicotine tax for novel tobacco products however as of february 22 2022 the legislation is still pending before the senate and could be subject to further tax related amendments 

federal state and local cigarette excise taxes have increased substantially over the past two decades far outpacing the rate of inflation between the end of 1998 and february 22 2022 the weightedaverage state cigarette excise tax increased from 036 to 189 per pack as of february 22 2022 no state has enacted new legislation increasing cigarette excise taxes in 2022 but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed 

a majority of states currently tax mst using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria supports legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on mst to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 22 2022 the federal government 23 states puerto rico philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for mst 

an increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on evapor and oral nicotine pouches as of february 22 2022 30 states the district of columbia puerto rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax evapor products these taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the evapor product form similarly 11 states and the district of columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on product sales of altria’s tobacco operating companies and juul through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments to lower taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products lower sales volume and reported share performance of altria’s tobacco operating companies’ and investees’ products could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings in addition substantial excise tax increases on evapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers’ transition to these products which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our vision 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 22 2022 181 countries as well as the european union have become parties to the fctc while the united states is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the us senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobaccorelated issues 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products it is not possible to predict the outcome of these

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 18 during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation operating income market share and industry volume increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the state settlement agreements the state settlement agreements’ inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3 or the us bureau of labor statistics’ consumer price index for all urban consumers “cpiu” percentage rate as published in january of each year as of december 2021 the inflation calculation was approximately 7 based on the latest cpiu data however the increase in the annual payments did not have a material impact on altria’s financial position altria believes that inflation will continue at increased levels in 2022 but does not expect the corresponding increase in annual payments to result in a material financial impact however we will continue to monitor conditions related to the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment 

for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements on altria see liquidity and capital resources  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below and note 18 the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities the state settlement agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 

other international federal state and local regulation and governmental and private activity 

▪ international federal state and local regulation various states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products including cigarettes smokeless tobacco cigars evapor products and oral nicotine pouches such as legislation that i prohibits the sale of all tobacco products or certain tobacco categories such as evapor ii prohibits the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors such as menthol cigarettes and flavored evapor products iii requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and iv restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions for example a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint or wintergreenflavored products as of february 22 2022 multiple states and localities are considering legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products and six states california massachusetts new jersey utah new york and illinois and the district of columbia have passed such legislation some of these states such as new york utah and illinois exempt certain products that have received fda market authorization through the pmta pathway 

the legislation in california bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors including menthol mint and wintergreen following enactment of the flavor ban in august 2020 several registered california voters filed a referendum against the legislation in january 2021 the requisite number of registered california voters signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot which will likely take place in november 2022 unless a special statewide election is called earlier as a result the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs 

massachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in evapor products similar legislation is pending in one other state 

restrictions on evapor and oral nicotine pouch products also have been instituted or proposed internationally 

altria’s tobacco operating companies have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal state and local legislation and other governmental action including through litigation it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul such action also could negatively impact adult smokers’ transition to these products which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our vision

▪ federal state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products after a number of states and localities proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products including evapor products in december 2019 the federal government passed legislation increasing the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products including evapor products to 21 nationwide as of february 22 2022 39 states the district of columbia and puerto rico have enacted laws increasing the legal age to purchase tobacco products to 21 although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on sales volume of our tobacco businesses as discussed above under underage access and use of certain tobacco products altria supports raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels reflecting its longstanding commitment to combat underage tobacco use 

▪ health effects of tobacco products including evapor products reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including various reports by the us surgeon general in 2019 there were public health advisories concerning vapingrelated lung injuries and deaths and there have been health concerns raised about potential increased risks associated with covid19 among smokers and vapers altria believes that the public should be guided by the messages of the us surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products including evapor products 

most jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting children it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on legislation and regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example during the covid19 pandemic state and local governments required additional health and safety requirements of all businesses including tobacco manufacturing and other facilities state and local governments also mandated the temporary closure of some businesses while many restrictions have eased it is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities and the facilities of our suppliers our suppliers’ suppliers and our trade partners could be subject to additional governmentmandated temporary closures and restrictions 

additionally in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes prohibit the sale of tobacco products based on environmental concerns require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco operating companies including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ governmental investigations from time to time altria and its subsidiaries and investees are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters for example i the ftc issued a civil investigative demand “cid” to altria while conducting its antitrust review of altria’s investment in juul seeking information regarding among other things altria’s role in the resignation of juul’s former chief executive officer and the hiring by juul of any current or former altria director executive or employee see note 18 and item 3 for a description of the ftc’s administrative complaint against altria and juul ii the sec commenced an investigation relating to altria’s acquisition disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the juul investment and iii the new york state office of the attorney general and the commonwealth of massachusetts office of the attorney general separately issued independent subpoenas to altria seeking documents relating to altria’s investment in and provision of services to juul additionally juul is currently under investigation by various federal and state agencies including the sec the fda and the ftc and state attorneys general such investigations vary in scope but at least some appear to include juul’s marketing practices particularly as such practices relate to youth and altria may be asked in the context of those investigations to provide information concerning its investment in juul or relating to its marketing of nu mark llc evapor products 

private sector activity on evapor 

a number of retailers including national chains have discontinued the sale of evapor products reasons for the discontinuation include reported illnesses related to evapor product use and the uncertain regulatory environment it is possible that this private sector activity

could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul and have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

illicit trade in tobacco products 

illicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of altria its tobacco operating companies and investees illicit trade can take many forms including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products the sale of tobacco products in the united states that are intended for sale outside the country the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another counterfeit tobacco products for example are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments counterfeit versions of our tobacco operating companies’ and investees’ products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands illicit trade in tobacco products also harms lawabiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment altria’s tobacco operating companies and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels moreover illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal state and local governments losing tax revenues losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions including increasing excise taxes imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact altria’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul and the businesses of its tobacco operating companies and investees or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold 

altria’s tobacco operating companies communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and when necessary litigate to protect their trademarks 

price availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials ingredients and component parts 

shifts in crops such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns government restrictions and mandated prices production control programs economic trade sanctions import duties and tariffs international trade disruptions inflation geopolitical instability climate and environmental changes and disruptions due to manmade or natural disasters may increase the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco or other raw materials or ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our companies’ and our investees’ products any significant change in the price availability or quality of tobacco other raw materials ingredients or component parts used to manufacture our products and those of our investees could restrict our tobacco operating companies’ and investees’ ability to continue manufacturing and marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our tobacco operating companies’ and investees’ profitability and businesses 

with respect to tobacco as with other agricultural commodities crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change additionally the price and availability of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand economic conditions including inflation and the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic are unpredictable which among other factors may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could negatively impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply in addition as consumer demand increases for smokefree products and decreases for combustible products the volume of tobacco leaf required for production may decrease the reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco as growers divert resources to other crops which could result in increased costs to our tobacco operating companies 

tobacco production in certain countries also is subject to a variety of controls including governmentmandated prices and production control programs moreover certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries’ ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability 

the covid19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials component parts and personal protective equipment as united states and global suppliers may temporarily shut down facilities or use different production schedules with lower productivity in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate in addition i current labor market dynamics indicate labor shortages with employers in a number of industries having difficulty employing workers and ii supply chain dynamics reflect failures and delays resulting from various issues including labor shortages logistical problems and weatherrelated incidents these labor shortages and supply failures and delays have led to certain increases in raw material for example resins used in our packaging ingredient and component part prices and may lead to supply chain disruptions however to date the impact on our operating companies and investees has been immaterial however the effects of the covid19 pandemic labor market dynamics and supply chain disruptions outlined above may continue which could adversely affect our subsidiaries’ and investees’ profitability and businesses recent economic conditions reflect an increased rate of inflation to date higher inflation has not had a material impact on our or our investees’ businesses revenues or profitability although altria anticipates inflation will continue at elevated levels in 2022 it is not expected to have a material impact on our or our investees’ businesses revenues or profitability 

in addition government taxes restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to and increase the costs of raw materials and component parts and potentially impede our ability to sell certain of our products for example additional

taxes on the use of certain singleuse plastics have been proposed by the us congress which if passed could increase the costs of and impair our ability to source certain materials used in the packaging for our tobacco operating companies’ products 

timing of sales 

in the ordinary course of business our tobacco operating companies are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events the timing of promotions customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and taxdriven price increases

financial review 

cash provided byused in operating activities 

during 2021 net cash provided by operating activities was 84 billion essentially unchanged from 2020 as higher net revenues net of excise taxes in the smokeable products and oral tobacco products segments were mostly offset by higher settlement and income tax payments

cash provided byused in investing activities 

during 2021 net cash provided by investing activities was 12 billion compared with net cash used in investing activities of 01 billion during 2020 this change was due primarily to proceeds from the ste michelle transaction higher proceeds from finance asset sales and lower capital expenditures 

capital expenditures for 2021 decreased 268 to 169 million capital expenditures were lower due primarily to the timing of projects and the sale of the wine business capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be in the range of 200 million to 250 million and are expected to be funded from operating cash flows 

cash provided byused in financing activities 

during 2021 net cash used in financing activities was 100 billion compared with 54 billion during 2020 this increase was due primarily to the following 

▪ repayment of 50 billion of altria senior unsecured notes in connection with the 2021 debt tender offers and redemption and payments of 06 billion for the premiums and fees in connection with the debt tender offers described above and in note 9 

▪ proceeds of 20 billion from the issuance of longterm senior unsecured notes in 2020 

▪ repayment of 15 billion in full of altria senior unsecured notes at scheduled maturity in may 2021

the guarantees provide that the guarantor guarantees the punctual payment when due whether at stated maturity by acceleration or otherwise of the obligations the liability of the guarantor under the guarantees is absolute and unconditional irrespective of any lack of validity enforceability or genuineness of any provision of any agreement or instrument relating thereto any change in the time manner or place of payment of or in any other term of all or any of the obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any agreement or instrument relating thereto any exchange release or nonperfection of any collateral or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guarantee for all or any of the obligations or any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to or a discharge of the parent or the guarantor 

under applicable provisions of federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer law the guarantees could be voided or claims in respect of the guarantees could be subordinated to the debts of the guarantor if among other things the guarantor at the time it incurred the obligations evidenced by the guarantees 

▪ received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration therefor and 

▪ either 

▪ was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such occurrence 

▪ was engaged in a business or transaction for which the assets of the guarantor constituted unreasonably small capital or 

▪ intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature

the measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing generally however the guarantor would be considered insolvent if 

▪ the sum of its debts including contingent liabilities was greater than the saleable value of its assets all at a fair valuation 

▪ the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they become absolute and mature or 

▪ it could not pay its debts as they become due

the obligations of the guarantor under the guarantees are limited to the maximum amount as will not result in the guarantor’s obligations under the guarantees constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of the guarantor that are relevant under bankruptcy law the uniform fraudulent conveyance act the uniform fraudulent transfer act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to the guarantees for this purpose “bankruptcy law” means title 11 us code or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors 

the guarantor will be unconditionally released and discharged from the obligations upon the earliest to occur of 

▪ the date if any on which the guarantor consolidates with or merges into the parent or any successor 

▪ the date if any on which the parent or any successor consolidates with or merges into the guarantor 

▪ the payment in full of the obligations pertaining to such guarantees and 

▪ the rating of the parent’s longterm senior unsecured debt by sp of a or higher 

the parent is a holding company therefore its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries neither the guarantor nor other 100 owned subsidiaries of the parent that are not guarantors of the debt “nonguarantor subsidiaries” are limited by contractual obligations on their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests

inclusion and diversity 

we recognize the critical importance of id in pursuing our vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures in 2020 we established the following aspirational id aiming points to help guide our efforts over the next 10 years 

▪ be an inclusive place to work for all employees regardless of level demographic group or work function 

▪ have equal numbers of men and women among our vice president and directorlevel employees 

▪ increase our vice president and directorlevel employees who are asian black hispanic or two or more races to at least 30 

▪ increase our vice president and directorlevel employees who are lgbtq a person with a disability or a veteran 

▪ have diverse functional leadership teams that reflect the organizations they lead 

we also believe in the importance of diverse suppliers throughout our companies’ supply chains including minority women veteran and lgbtqowned businesses 

compensation and benefits 

our compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract retain and motivate strong talent however we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent we work to manage this risk by among other things targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies for which we compete for talent depending on 

employee level total compensation includes different elements – base salary annual cash incentives longterm equity and cash incentives and benefits our goal is to provide total compensation packages between the 50th and 75th percentiles of total compensation packages paid to employees in comparable positions at our peer companies upon attainment of business and individual goals 

we are committed to pay equity across our companies based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in november 2020 for employees performing the same or similar duties salaries of our female employees were 982 of those of our male employees and salaries of our nonwhite employees were 985 of those of our white employees after adjusting for factors generally considered to be legitimate differentiators of salary such as performance and tenure the percentages increased to 994 and 996 respectively 

in addition to cash and equity compensation we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans consumerdriven health plan coverage vacation and holiday pay up to 12 weeks paid parental and family leave for birth adoption and foster placement and disability and life insurance our benefits also include wellness benefits and family creation assistance benefits such as adoption assistance and coverage for fertility treatments in response to the covid19 pandemic for 2020 and 2021 we expanded dependent care coverage to include 5000 employee reimbursement for remote learning and other dependent care costs while there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies the examples we provide are available to most employees 

we are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through an unlimited tuition refund program for jobrelated courses or companyrelated degrees 

attracting developing and retaining talent 

our salaried entrylevel recruitment efforts focus on recruiting relationships with universities internship opportunities and partnerships with organizations that support diverse students we complement these recruiting efforts with hiring experienced employees with demonstrated leadership capabilities 

to help our employees succeed in their roles and develop in their careers we emphasize ongoing training and leadership development opportunities building skills that drive innovation and aligning our employees to our vision is important for our longterm success the human resources department leads our learning and development efforts partnering with learning professionals embedded in functions throughout our operating and services companies employees have access to a wide variety of development programs including new employee onboarding classroom and selfguided training programs technical training and our educational refund program for continuing education 

we regularly conduct anonymous employee engagement surveys to seek feedback on a variety of topics including employee satisfaction confidence in company leadership corporate culture and culture of compliance in addition in 2020 we conducted employee surveys to gauge employee wellbeing in light of the covid19 pandemic and altered work environments including working from home survey results including comparisons to prior results are shared with our employees and our board and are used to modify or enhance our human capital management programs 

workplace safety 

our safety goal is for all employees to have an injuryfree career we regularly update our policies procedures and equipment as new developments occur in safety and health standards and communicate safety messages and provide safety training as appropriate throughout our companies our most recent osha recordable injury rate of 19 fro m 2019 is lower than the benchmark for companies in the us beverage and tobacco product manufacturing industry classification 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we rapidly implemented safety measures to help protect our employees including remote work for nonmanufacturing salaried employees and at our manufacturing locations social distancing protocols daily temperature checks and additional cleaning and sanitation practices 

number of employees and labor relations 

at december 31 2020 we employed approximately 7100 people twentyseven percent of those employees were hourly manufacturing employees and members of labor unions subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe we engage and collaborate effectively with our hourly employees as demonstrated by the positive working relationship between our companies and the unions we also have longterm agreements that resolve any collective bargaining dispute through binding arbitration which further demonstrates the trustbased relationship with the unions 

supply chain human capital matters 

in addition to supplier diversity efforts referenced above we support efforts to address human capital concerns in the tobacco supply chain for example in our domestic tobacco supply chain we use onfarm good agricultural practices assessments to assess growers’ compliance with practices related to labor management our tobacco companies also establish contract terms and conditions with tobacco growers addressing child and forced labor and conduct social compliance audits in highrisk tobacco growing regions

▪ government regulations altria and its subsidiaries are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations for discussion of laws and regulations impacting altria’s tobacco operating companies see tobacco space  business environment in item 7 for discussion of laws and regulations impacting the wine segment see wine segment  business environment in item 7 

altria and its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries are also subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection including in the united states the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party subsidiaries and former subsidiaries of altria are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under superfund or other laws and regulations altria’s subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations as discussed in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 2” altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change other than those amounts it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of altria may undertake in the future in the opinion of management however compliance with environmental laws and regulations including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated results of operations capital expenditures financial position or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our results of operations our cash flows our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this form 10k 

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec reports to security holders press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans estimates and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this form 10k particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses below in item 7 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all 

risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

risks related to litigation legislative or regulatory action 

unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees 

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria and its subsidiaries including pm usa and usstc as well as their respective indemnitees indemnitors and altria’s investees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability unfair trade practices antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors shareholders and distributors legislative action such as changes to tort law also may expand the types of claims and remedies available to plaintiffs 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases have ranged in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome 

in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 18 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 18” tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation altria its subsidiaries and its investees may face potentially significant nonmonetary remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in note 18 the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” in the patent lawsuit pending before the united states international trade commission “itc” discussed in note 18 the plaintiffs seek a prohibition on the importation of the iqos electronic device heatsticks and component parts into the united states additionally the on transaction discussed in note 1 background and basis of presentation to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 1” had been the subject of an arbitration which the parties agreed to settle for an immaterial amount to altria in february 2021 an adverse outcome in the arbitration could have adversely affected helix’s ability to compete effectively with oral nicotine pouches 

in 2019 we determined that our investment in juul was impaired in part due to the increase in the number and type of legal cases pending against juul altria and pm usa are also defendants in many of these cases in addition in april 2020 the ftc issued an administrative complaint against altria and juul alleging that altria’s 35 investment in juul and the associated agreements constitute unreasonable restraint on trade evapor litigation and the ftc action including the remedies the ftc is seeking are further discussed in note 18 

altria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain 

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria to do so see item 3 legal proceedings “item 3” note 18 and exhibits 991 and 992 to this form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

significant federal state and local governmental actions including actions by the fda and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on us and our tobacco subsidiaries’ or our investees’ businesses and sales volumes 

as described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7 pm usa faces significant governmental and private sector actions including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold pm usa responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke these actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels 

more broadly actions by the fda and other federal state or local governments or agencies including those specific actions described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7 may i impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products for example through nicotine or constituent limits or menthol or other flavor bans ii limit adult tobacco consumer choices iii delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk iv require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace for example as a result of a product contamination b legislation and rulemaking that bans menthol or other flavors c a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence d because the fda requires that a currently marketed tobacco product proceed through the premarket review process or e because the fda does not authorize a pmta or otherwise determines that removal is necessary for the protection of public health v restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers vi restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products vii create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies viii impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements ix interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business or x restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting altria’s investment in juul see tobacco space  business environment in item 7 for a more detailed discussion 

tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the federal state and local levels the frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors including federal and state budgets which have been negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic and the composition of executive and legislative bodies tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may also have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes in item 7 

unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria and its subsidiaries or its investees 

from time to time altria its subsidiaries and its investees are subject to federal and state governmental investigations on a range of matters for further discussion of current pending investigations see tobacco space  business environment  other international federal state and local regulation and governmental and private activity in item 7 we cannot predict the outcome of any such investigation and it is possible that our business or the businesses of our investees could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of any current or future investigation 

a challenge to our tax positions or an increase in the income tax rate could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

tax laws and regulations such as the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” are complex and subject to varying interpretations a successful challenge to one or more of altria’s tax positions which could give rise to additional liabilities including interest and potential penalties or an increase in the corporate income tax rate could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

international business operations subject altria and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

while altria and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as foreign privacy laws the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees investees or third parties violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

risks related to our businesses 

altria its subsidiaries and its investees face various risks related to health epidemics and pandemics including the covid19 pandemic and similar outbreaks which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries and investees 

altria’s its subsidiaries’ and its investees’ business and financial results consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be negatively impacted by health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks the spreading covid19 pandemic could have negative impacts such as i a global or us recession or other economic crisis including a financial crisis ii credit and capital markets volatility and access to these markets including by those in the distribution and supply chains iii significant volatility in demand for our tobacco and wine subsidiaries’ and investees’ products iv changes in adult consumer accessibility to those products including due to government action v changes in adult consumer behavior and preferences including trading down to lowerpriced products or cessation of product use due to public health actions or concerns and economic conditions including those stemming from potential changes in government stimulus or reductions in unemployment payments or other benefits and vi extended or multiple disruptions in our subsidiaries’ or investees’ manufacturing operations or in their distribution and supply chains in addition our subsidiaries’ and investees’ operations may incur increased costs and otherwise be negatively affected if significant portions of their respective workforces or the workforces within their respective distribution or supply chains are unable to work or work effectively including because of illness unavailability of personal protective equipment quarantines government actions facility closures or other restrictions 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of the outbreak increases in the number of cases in future periods and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate the public health effects we cannot at this time predict the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our or our investees’ future financial or operational results but the impact could be material over time see the risks below related to extended disruptions at a facility of a distributor or in service by a service provider and the risks related to our investment in abi and the earnings from and carrying value of that investment for further discussion on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the tobacco and wine businesses see tobacco space  business environment and wine segment  business environment in item 7 

our tobacco businesses face significant competition including across categories and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria or the business of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

each of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories this competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve significant methods of competition include product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging distribution and promotional activities this highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria see tobacco space  business environment  summary in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences growth of the evapor product category and other innovative tobacco products including oral nicotine pouches has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and has adversely affected the growth rates of other tobacco products including smokeless tobacco in addition growth of unregulated synthetic nicotine products which may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions including marketing restrictions and fda premarketing requirements as the tobaccoderived oral nicotine products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries could negatively impact the growth of our oral nicotine pouch products continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

pm usa also faces competition from lowerpriced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states and as such are not required to make annual settlement payments as required by the parties to the settlements these settlement payments are significant for pm usa as described in debt and liquidity  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation in item 7 these settlements among other factors resulted in substantial cigarette price increases to help cover the cost of the settlement payments manufacturers not party to the settlements are subject to state escrow legislation requiring escrow deposits such manufacturers may avoid these escrow obligations by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowerpriced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced competitive brands 

altria and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of altria or the business of altria’s tobacco and wine subsidiaries 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 

▪ promote brand equity successfully 

▪ anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult consumer preferences 

▪ develop manufacture market and distribute new and innovative products that appeal to adult consumers including where appropriate through arrangements with or investments in third parties 

▪ improve productivity and 

▪ protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases 

see tobacco space  business environment  summary in item 7 and the immediately preceding risk factor for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences specifically the growth of evapor and other innovative tobacco products and the effects on our tobacco operating companies 

see wine segment  business environment  summary in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult alcohol consumer preferences specifically the slowing of the premium wine category and the effects on our wine subsidiaries 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries while our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products the failure to do so could negatively impact our companies’ ability to compete in these circumstances 

our financial services business conducted through pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation real estate and manufacturing equipment its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with certain other tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams andor put them at a competitive disadvantage 

altria and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with certain other tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences examples include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful such as electronically heated tobacco products oral nicotine pouches and evapor products 

in addition to internal product development these efforts include arrangements with or investments in third parties such as our arrangement with pmi to commercialize iqos and related heatstick products in the united states which is governed by an exclusive license and distribution agreement the initial 5year term of this agreement expires in april 2024 and renews at our option for an additional 5year period so long as we achieve certain performance objectives the initial term performance objectives are based on achieving 05 dollar share of the cigarette category within a certain period of time in a certain number of geographic areas in addition to maintain our exclusive distribution rights as to pmi during the term of the agreement we must achieve certain performance objectives within a specified time period by april 2022 the exclusive distribution rights performance objectives are based on achieving 05 dollar share of the cigarette category within a certain period of time in a single geographic area while we believe altria will meet the initial term and exclusive distribution rights performance objectives it is possible that we may not meet them or that we may have a disagreement with pmi as to whether those objectives have been met in either case it could result in the loss of i our unilateral right to extend the agreement for the additional 5year period and therefore we would no longer be able to commercialize iqos and related heatstick products after april 2024 or ii our exclusive distribution rights as to pmi 

additionally our investment in juul subjects us to noncompetition obligations restricting us from investing or engaging in the evapor business other than through juul subject to certain exceptions 

our tobacco subsidiaries and investees may not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize these adjacent products which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams 

further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of any particular innovative products including products with claims of reduced risk to adult consumers the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products in addition the fda could for a variety of reasons determine that innovative products currently on the market but pending fda review of the associated pmta such as on oral nicotine pouches or those that have previously received authorization including with a claim of reduced exposure such as iqos  are not appropriate for the public health and the fda could require such products be taken off the market see tobacco space  business environment  fsptca and fda regulation in item 7 for further discussion we also cannot predict whether these products will appeal to adult tobacco consumers or whether adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing decisions would be affected by reducedrisk claims on such products if permitted adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products 

if our tobacco subsidiaries or investees do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products including with claims of reduced risk but one or more of their competitors does succeed our tobacco subsidiaries or investees may be at a competitive disadvantage which could have an adverse effect on their financial performance 

significant changes in price availability or quality of tobacco other raw materials or component parts could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees 

any significant change in prices quality or availability of tobacco other raw materials or component parts including as a result of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ and our investees’ profitability and business the covid19 pandemic also may impact the availability of direct materials necessary for our tobacco subsidiaries and juul to remain compliant with fda and other regulatory requirements for tobacco products for further discussion see tobacco space  business environment  price availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials and component parts in item 7 

altria’s subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers distributors and distribution chain service providers an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier distributor or distribution chain service provider could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco and wine subsidiaries and investees 

altria’s subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant manufacturing facilities and a small number of key suppliers distributors and distribution chain service providers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria’s tobacco or wine subsidiaries or investees the operations of any key supplier distributor or distribution chain service provider of any of altria’s tobacco or wine subsidiaries or investees or any other disruption in the supply or distribution of goods or services including a key supplier’s inability to comply with government regulations or unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries and investees for example in march 2020 the covid19 pandemic resulted in a temporary suspension of operations at pm usa’s richmond virginia manufacturing facility which is the primary facility for manufacturing pm usa cigarettes some state governors also have issued executive orders requiring that certain businesses temporarily suspend operations for varying periods of time while the covid19 pandemic persists operations of our subsidiaries suppliers distributors and distribution chain service providers and those of our investees could be suspended temporarily once or multiple times or closed permanently depending on various factors including how long the covid19 pandemic persists and the extent to which state local and federal governments as well as foreign countries impose restrictions on the operation of facilities or otherwise place limits on the supply and distribution chains an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria’s subsidiaries investees or in the supply or distribution of goods or services by one or more key suppliers distributors or distribution chain service providers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco and wine subsidiaries and investees 

altria’s subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products which could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

in addition to a recall required by the fda as referenced above our subsidiaries could decide or other laws or regulations could require them to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

the failure of altria’s information systems or service providers’ information systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

altria and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers such as cloud providers to support a variety of business processes and activities including complying with regulatory legal financial reporting and tax requirements engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations manufacturing and distributing our products collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information and 

communicating internally and externally with employees investors suppliers trade customers adult consumers and others we continue to make investments in administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyberthreats including human error and malicious acts our safeguards include employee training testing and auditing protocols backup systems and business continuity plans maintenance of security policies and procedures monitoring of networks and systems and thirdparty risk management 

to date interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations however because technology is increasingly complex and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future failure of our systems or service providers’ systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands operational disruptions legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria and its subsidiaries 

altria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage tobacco control actions and other factors 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that may enjoy greater societal acceptance and fewer longerterm challenges as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

altria may be required to write down intangible assets including goodwill due to impairment which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions such as continued uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences success of planned new product expansions competitive activity and income and excise taxes certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets if an impairment is determined to exist in either situation we will incur impairment losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position for further discussion see discussion and analysis  critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 

competition changes in adult consumer preferences unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle’s business is impacted by evolving adult consumer preferences shifts away from the wine category to other alcohol categories or shifts to lowerpriced wines have resulted and could continue to result in slowing growth in ste michelle’s sales and increased inventory levels and have a material adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business as discussed in note 5 asset impairment exit and implementation costs to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 5” during the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of inventory levels significantly exceeding longterm forecasted demand ste michelle recorded pretax charges of 411 million in cost of sales including a 292 million inventory write off 100 million in estimated losses on future noncancelable grape purchase commitments and 19 million in inventory disposal costs and other charges evolving adult consumer preferences an economic downturn or recession or other factors could result in a further slowdown in the wine category and otherwise have a material adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business 

the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages or surpluses related to any one or more of these factors could impact production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies federal state and local governmental agencies also regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment in item 7 

risks related to the capital markets and financing 

acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria’s credit rating and altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction 

from time to time altria considers acquisitions investments or dispositions and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition investment disposition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our investment grade credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in juul 

any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and also may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment additionally there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our businesses or investments on favorable terms which may result in a loss in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings losses 

disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect altria’s access to these markets earnings and dividend rate 

access to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs for example we typically access the commercial paper market early in the second quarter to help fund payments under the master settlement agreement tax obligations and shareholder dividends disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability pricing credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

altria may be unable to attract investors due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage 

there is increasing investor focus on environmental social and governance “esg” matters organizations that provide esg information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions decreasing social acceptance of tobacco products or unfavorable esg ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward altria which could result in shareholders choosing to divest their ownership in altria stock or choosing not to invest in our stock and could have a negative impact on the market performance of our stock 

risks related to our investments 

a challenge to our investment in juul if successful could result in a broad range of resolutions including divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction 

a challenge to our investment in juul if successful could result in a broad range of resolutions such as divestiture of the investment or rescission of the transaction in april 2020 the ftc issued an administrative complaint against altria and juul alleging that altria’s 35 investment in juul and the associated agreements constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the sherman act and section 5 of the ftc act and substantially lessened competition in violation of section 7 of the clayton act the ftc seeks a broad range of remedies including divestiture of altria’s investment in juul rescission of the transaction and prohibition against any officer or director of either altria or juul serving on the other’s board of directors or attending meetings the administrative trial will take place before an ftc administrative law judge and is currently scheduled to begin june 2021 any ruling by the ftc is subject to review by the ftc commissioners and subsequently by a federal appellate court if appealed 

also various putative class action lawsuits have been filed against altria and in some cases subsidiaries of altria and juul the lawsuits cite the ftc administrative complaint referenced above and allege claims similar to those made by the ftc plaintiffs in these lawsuits are seeking various remedies including treble damages attorneys’ fees a declaration that the agreements between altria and juul are invalid divestiture of altria’s investment in juul and rescission of the transaction 

a successful challenge by the ftc or the plaintiffs in the lawsuits to the investment would adversely affect us including by eliminating or substantially limiting our rights with respect to our investment in juul for further discussion see note 18 

the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all 

regardless of whether antitrust clearance is obtained the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all including due to the risks encountered by juul in its business such as operational risks competitive risks and regulatory and legislative risks at the international federal state and local levels including actions by the fda and adverse publicity due to underage use of evapor products and other factors unanticipated impacts on juul’s relationships with employees customers suppliers and other third parties potential disruptions to juul’s management or current or future plans and operations or domestic or international litigation developments investigations or otherwise as discussed in note 18 juul and altria andor its subsidiaries including pm usa are named as defendants in various individual and class action lawsuits juul also is named in a significant number of additional individual and class action lawsuits to which neither altria nor its subsidiaries is a party see tobacco space  business environment in item 7 for a discussion of certain fdarelated regulatory risks applicable to the evapor category including the potential removal of certain evapor products from the market as a result of fda enforcement action and the potential denial of new tobacco product applications for evapor products failure to realize the expected benefits of our juul investment could adversely affect the value of the investment 

as discussed in investments in equity securities in note 6 as part of the preparation of our financial statements for the quarters ended september 30 2019 december 31 2019 and september 30 2020 we performed valuations of our investment in juul as a result of the existence of impairment indicators as a result we determined that our investment in juul was impaired and recorded total noncash 

pretax impairment charges of 112 billion following share conversion in the fourth quarter of 2020 altria elected to account for its equity method investment in juul under the fair value option under this option altria’s consolidated statements of earnings losses include any cash dividends received from its investment in juul and any changes in the fair value of its investment which is calculated quarterly while we believe the december 31 2020 valuation of 17 billion is the appropriate current fair value of our investment the risks identified in this paragraph some of which are also further discussed in discussion and analysis  investments in juul and tobacco space  business environment in item 7 and in note 18 are ongoing with respect to the current fair value quarterly fair value changes could create volatility in altria’s consolidated financial position and earnings and if the fair value of our investment in juul decreases it could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

our investment in juul includes noncompetition standstill and transfer restrictions that prevent us from gaining control of juul furthermore if we elect not to extend our noncompetition obligations beyond december 20 2024 we would lose certain of our governance consent preemptive and other rights with respect to our investment in juul 

the shares of juul we hold generally cannot be sold or otherwise transferred until december 20 2024 subject to limited exceptions we also generally agreed not to compete with juul in the evapor category until at least december 20 2024 which may be extended at our election if however juul is prohibited by federal law from selling evapor products in the us for at least one year or if altria’s carrying value of the juul investment is not more than 10 of its initial carrying value of 128 billion we may elect to compete with juul in the evapor category prior to december 20 2024 in addition in the event we elect to exercise our board designation rights at juul juul’s board of directors will include nine members three of whom will be designated by altria including one independent designee juul’s strategy and its material decisions are not and will not be controlled by us and the terms of our agreements with juul mean that we are required to bear the risks associated with our investment in juul and are restricted from competing with juul until at least december 20 2024 subject to the exceptions mentioned above further if we elect not to extend our noncompetition obligations beyond that date or to terminate such obligations in the circumstances described above we would lose some or all of our board designation rights preemptive rights consent rights and other rights with respect to our investment in juul loss of these rights could adversely affect us by impairing our ability to influence juul 

altria’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in abi and the dividends paid by abi on shares owned by altria may be adversely affected by various factors including foreign currency exchange rates and abi’s business results including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and stock price in addition if the carrying value of our investment in abi exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired which would result in impairment losses 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi are translated into us dollars “usd” from various local currencies in addition abi pays dividends in euros which we convert into usd during times of a strengthening usd against these currencies our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer usd and the dividends that we receive from abi will convert into fewer usd dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi are also subject to the risks encountered by abi in its business its business outlook cash flow requirements and financial performance the state of the market and the general economic climate including the impact of the covid19 pandemic for example in 2020 as a result of the uncertainty volatility and impact of the covid19 pandemic on abi’s business abi reduced by 50 its final 2019 dividend paid in the second quarter of 2020 and did not pay its interim 2020 dividend that would have been paid in the fourth quarter of 2020 which resulted in a reduction of cash dividends altria received from abi 

in addition since october 2019 the carrying value of our investment in abi has exceeded the fair value of our equity investment in abi we concluded at december 31 2020 that the decline in fair value of our investment in abi below its carrying value continues to be temporary if however the carrying value of our investment in abi exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings we cannot provide any assurance that abi will successfully execute its business plans and strategies earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi are also subject to fluctuations in abi’s stock price see note 6 for further discussion 

we received a substantial portion of our consideration from the october 2016 sabmiller plc “sabmiller”abi business combination “abi transaction” in the form of restricted shares subject to a fiveyear lockup furthermore if our percentage ownership in abi were to decrease below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities incur a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the abi board of directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 

upon completion of the abi transaction we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the abi transaction subject to limited exceptions these transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in abi for a fiveyear period that expires on october 10 2021 further in the event that our ownership percentage in abi were to decrease below certain levels i we may be subject to additional tax liabilities ii the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the abi board of directors could be 

reduced from two to one or zero and iii we may be unable to continue to account for our investment in abi under the equity method of accounting 

tax authorities may challenge the tax treatment of the consideration altria received in the abi transaction and the tax treatment of the abi investment may not be as favorable as altria anticipates 

while we expect the tax treatment of the consideration that we received from the abi transaction to be respected the statute of limitations for the tax year in which the transaction occurred has not expired therefore we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and if they do what the outcome of any such challenge will be in addition there is a risk that the tax treatment of our investment in abi may not be as favorable as we anticipate 

the expected benefits of the cronos transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all 

in march 2019 we acquired common shares representing a 45 equity interest in cronos a warrant to acquire common shares representing an additional 10 equity interest in cronos and antidilution protections to purchase cronos shares to maintain our ownership percentage there can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits of the cronos transaction including due to the risks encountered by cronos in its business such as operational risks and legal and regulatory risks unanticipated impacts on cronos’s relationships with third parties its management or its current or future plans and operations due to the cronos transaction or other factors or domestic or international litigation developments tax disputes investigations or otherwise or that cronos will successfully execute its business plans and strategies further a failure by cronos or altria to comply with applicable laws including cannabis laws could result in criminal civil or tax liability for altria if the carrying value of our investment in cronos exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings

covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has led to adverse impacts on the us and global economies and continues to create economic uncertainty although much uncertainty still surrounds the pandemic including its duration and ultimate overall impact on us and global economies its subsidiaries’ operations and those of altria’s investees altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of the covid19 pandemic and continues to carefully evaluate potential outcomes and work to mitigate risks specifically altria remains focused on any potential impact to its liquidity operations supply and distribution chains and on economic conditions 

in terms of altria’s liquidity despite some volatility in the commercial paper market in march 2020 altria was able to build and maintain a higher cash balance than normal to preserve its financial flexibility as a precautionary measure in march 2020 altria borrowed the full 30 billion available under its senior unsecured 5year revolving credit agreement as amended the “credit agreement” which altria subsequently repaid in full in june 2020 in may 2020 altria issued 20 billion of longterm debt in the form of senior unsecured notes in april 2020 the board of directors rescinded the 500 million remaining in the previously authorized 10 billion share repurchase program altria did not repurchase any shares under its share repurchase program in 2020 

as with so many other companies throughout the us and globally altria’s operations have been affected by the covid19 pandemic altria has implemented remote working for many employees and aligned with the social distancing protocols recommended by public 

table of contents 

health authorities to date altria believes its tobacco businesses have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations but continues to monitor these factors altria continues to believe that remote working due to the covid19 pandemic has had minimal impact on productivity also altria’s critical information technology systems have remained operational although altria’s tobacco businesses previously suspended operations temporarily at several of their manufacturing facilities in march 2020 the businesses resumed operations at those facilities under enhanced safety protocols in april 2020 and all manufacturing facilities are currently operational under enhanced safety protocols altria continues to monitor the risks associated with facility disruptions and workforce availability as a result of uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic 

altria’s suppliers and those within its distribution chain are also subject to government actions that may require the closure of a facility and remote working protocols to date altria has not experienced any material disruptions to its supply chains or distribution systems but is continuing to monitor these factors the majority of retail stores in which altria’s tobacco products are sold including convenience stores have been deemed to be essential businesses by authorities and have remained open altria continues to monitor the risk that one or more suppliers distributors or any other entities within our supply and distribution chain closes temporarily or permanently 

in march 2020 pm usa temporarily closed its atlanta and richmond iqos stores and paused its iqos interactive marketing efforts in june 2020 pm usa reopened its atlanta and richmond iqos stores and in july 2020 pm usa launched iqos in charlotte with all stores operating under enhanced safety protocols 

in 2020 altria incurred net pretax charges of 50 million which were directly related to disruptions caused by or efforts to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic these costs which were recorded in the second quarter and excluded from altria’s adjusted results included premium pay personal protective equipment and health screenings partially offset by certain employment tax credits these net pretax charges do not include the inventoryrelated implementation costs associated with the wine business strategic reset 

although altria’s tobacco businesses have not been materially impacted to date by the covid19 pandemic there is continued uncertainty as to how the covid19 pandemic may impact adult tobacco consumers in the future altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of the covid19 pandemic and their effect on adult tobacco consumers including stayathome practices and disposable income which may be impacted by unemployment rates and fiscal stimulus altria also continues to monitor adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing behaviors including overall tobacco product expenditures mix between premium and discount brand purchases and adoption of noncombustible products 

while altria’s tobacco businesses have not been materially impacted to date by the covid19 pandemic altria has experienced adverse impacts to its alcohol assets in the wine business ste michelle’s directtoconsumer sales and onpremise wine sales in restaurants bars and hospitality venues and on cruise lines have been and continue to be negatively impacted by disruptions arising from the covid19 pandemic which also may have an impact on adult wine consumers going forward in 2020 against a backdrop of product volume demand uncertainty and longterm noncancelable grape purchase commitments which have been further negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic including economic uncertainty and government actions that restrict directtoconsumer sales and onpremise sales ste michelle recorded pretax charges of 411 million consisting primarily of i the writeoff of inventory and ii estimated losses on future noncancelable grape purchase commitments altria and ste michelle also undertook a review of the wine business resulting in a strategic reset ste michelle continues to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic associated risks to its business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

abi has also been impacted by the covid19 pandemic including i a 50 reduction to its final 2019 dividend paid in the second quarter of 2020 and a decision to forgo its interim 2020 dividend that would have been paid in the fourth quarter of 2020 ii the withdrawal of its guidance for 2020 due to the uncertainty volatility and impact of the covid19 pandemic and iii a goodwill impairment charge related to its africa businesses in 2020 in addition the extreme market disruption and volatility associated with the covid19 pandemic resulted in a steep decline in abi’s stock price in the first half of 2020 although there was a gradual recovery in abi’s stock price in the second half of 2020 the fair value of altria’s investment in abi is below the carrying value while altria believes that this decline is temporary it will continue to monitor its investment in abi including the impact of the covid19 pandemic on abi’s business and market valuation 

altria considered the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the business of juul including its sales distribution operations supply chain and liquidity in conducting its periodic impairment assessment and quantitative valuations while the impact of the covid19 pandemic was considered in our quantitative valuations during the year ended december 31 2020 altria does not believe the covid19 pandemic was a primary driver of the noncash pretax impairment charge of 26 billion recorded during the three months ended september 30 2020 or the 100 million increase in fair value during the three months ended december 31 2020 altria will continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on juul’s business in our quarterly valuations of juul 

altria has considered the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the business of cronos including its sales distribution operations supply chain and liquidity cronos has been and continues to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic due in part to government action requiring closures or limited occupancy of retail stores in the united states during the second quarter of 2020 cronos recorded an impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic which altria recorded in the

third quarter of 2020 due to its onequarter lag in reporting cronos’s results altria will continue to monitor its investment in cronos including the impact of the covid19 pandemic on cronos’s business and market valuation 

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in net earnings losses and diluted eps attributable to altria for the year ended december 31 2020 from the year ended december 31 2019 were due primarily to the following 



1 prior period amounts have been recast to conform with current period presentation for certain abi marktomarket adjustments that were not previously identified as special items and that are now excluded from altria’s adjusted financial measures for further discussion see below 

for a discussion of special items and other business drivers affecting the comparability of statements of earnings losses amounts and reconciliations of adjusted earnings attributable to altria and adjusted diluted eps attributable to altria see the consolidated operating results section below 

▪ fewer shares outstanding fewer shares outstanding during 2020 compared with 2019 were due primarily to the timing of shares repurchased by altria in 2019 under its share repurchase program 

▪ change in tax rate the change in tax rate which excludes the impact of tax items shown above was driven primarily by lower dividends from abi 

table of contents 

▪ operations the increase of 353 million in operations which excludes the impact of special items shown above was due primarily to the following 

▪ higher income from the smokeable products and oral tobacco products segments 

partially offset by 

▪ lower income from altria’s equity investments in abi and cronos 

▪ higher losses in the all other category primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual values of certain assets at pmcc in 2020 

▪ higher amortization expense 

▪ higher interest and other debt expense net and 

▪ lower income from the wine segment 

for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections below 

2021 forecasted results 

altria forecasts its 2021 fullyear adjusted diluted eps to be in a range of 449 to 462 representing a growth rate of 3 to 6 over its 2020 fullyear adjusted diluted eps base of 436 as shown in the table below while the 2021 fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance accounts for a range of scenarios the external environment remains dynamic altria will continue to monitor conditions related to i unemployment rates ii fiscal stimulus iii adult tobacco consumer dynamics including stayathome practices disposable income purchasing patterns and adoption of noncombustible products iv regulatory and legislative including excise tax developments v the timing and breadth of covid19 vaccine deployment and vi expectations for adjusted earnings contributions from its alcohol assets 

altria’s 2021 fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance range includes planned investments in support of its vision such as i marketplace investments to expand the availability and awareness of altria’s noncombustible products ii costs associated with building an industryleading consumer engagement platform that enhances data collection and insights in support of adult tobacco consumer conversion to noncombustible products and iii increased noncombustible product research and development expense altria expects 2021 adjusted diluted eps growth to come in the last three quarters of the year primarily due to prior year comparisons including one fewer shipping day for the smokeable products segment in the first quarter 

this forecasted growth rate excludes estimated per share charges in the first quarter of 2021 of 027 for loss on early extinguishment of debt for the february 2021 tender offers and redemption for further discussion see financial review  debt and liquidity  debt below 

altria expects its 2021 fullyear adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of 245 to 255 



for a discussion of certain income and expense items excluded from the forecasted results above see the consolidated operating results section below 

altria’s fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance and fullyear forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items including those items noted in the nongaap financial measures section below that management believes are not part of underlying operations altria’s management cannot estimate on a forwardlooking basis the impact of these items on its reported diluted eps or its reported effective tax rate because these items which could be significant may be unusual or infrequent are difficult to predict and may be highly variable as a result altria does not provide a corresponding gaap measure for or reconciliation to its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast

nongaap financial measures 

while altria reports its financial results in accordance with gaap its management also reviews certain financial results including oci oci margins net earnings losses attributable to altria and diluted eps on an adjusted basis which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example loss on early extinguishment of debt restructuring charges asset impairment charges acquisitionrelated costs covid19 special items equity investmentrelated special items including any changes in fair value of the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights certain tax items charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items and resolutions of certain nonparticipating manufacturer “npm” adjustment disputes under the 1998 master settlement agreement such dispute resolutions are referred to as “npm adjustment items” altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria’s underlying results as they may be highly variable may be unusual or infrequent are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis altria’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate 

altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria’s chief operating decision maker “codm” for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets these adjusted financial measures are not required by or calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation the consolidated financial statements include altria as well as its wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in equity securities in which altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for either under the equity method of accounting or the fair value option investments in equity securities that altria does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for as an investment in an equity security all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

▪ revenue recognition altria’s businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers while altria’s businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type all sales contracts are similarly structured these contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer all performance obligations are satisfied within one year therefore costs to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred and unsatisfied performance obligations are not disclosed there is no financing component because altria’s businesses expect at contract inception that the period between when altria’s businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less 

altria’s businesses define net revenues as revenues which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers net of cash discounts for prompt payment sales returns also referred to as returned goods and sales incentives altria’s businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and valueadded taxes imposed at the time of sale which do not include excise taxes on cigarettes cigars smokeless tobacco or wine billed to customers 

altria’s businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer altria’s businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer altria’s businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings losses altria’s businesses record an allowance for returned goods based principally on historical volume and return rates which is included in other accrued liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets altria’s businesses record sales incentives which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities as a reduction to revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers retailers 

table of contents 

and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical volume utilization and redemption rates expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets 

payment terms vary depending on product type altria’s businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue which is included in other accrued liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized pm usa receives payment in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product usstc receives substantially all payments within one business day of the customer obtaining control of the product ste michelle receives substantially all payments from customers within 45 days of the customer obtaining control of the product amounts due from customers are included in receivables on altria’s consolidated balance sheets 

for further discussion see note 3 revenues from contracts with customers to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if altria determines that an impairment exists any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

altria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria to perform an interim review altria has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test if necessary altria will perform a single step quantitative impairment test additionally altria has the option to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment if the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit but is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified 

goodwill by reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible assets at december 31 2020 were as follows 



during 2020 altria completed its annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets performed as of october 1 2020 and the results of this testing were as follows 

▪ no impairment charges were recorded 

▪ the estimated fair values of the cigarettes cigars and oral nicotine pouches reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets within the cigars reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying values 

▪ the estimated fair values of the mst and snus products reporting unit and the indefinitelived intangible assets within the reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying values with the exception of the skoal trademark skoal continues to be impacted by increased competition as well as adult tobacco consumer movement among tobacco products including oral nicotine pouch products at december 31 2020 the estimated fair value of the skoal trademark exceeded its carrying value of 39 billion by approximately 28 which is an increase from approximately 18 at december 31 2019 this increase is due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate resulting from changes in market inputs altria believes an increase in the future 

table of contents 

discount rate in isolation which could be caused by numerous factors including changes in market inputs as well as the specific risks associated with the skoal business could have the potential to materially decrease the future estimated fair value of the skoal trademark a 1 increase in the discount rate would have resulted in the estimated fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 13 at december 31 2020 and 

▪ the estimated fair values of the indefinitelived intangible assets within the wine reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying values with the exception of the patz  hall trademark which at december 31 2020 exceeded its carrying value of 30 million by approximately 6 

during 2019 altria’s quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in 74 million of impairment charges during 2018 altria’s quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in 54 million of impairment charges for further discussion on goodwill see note 4 goodwill and other intangible assets net to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 4 ”  

in 2020 altria elected to perform a qualitative assessment for certain of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was morelikelythannot that the fair values of its reporting units were below carrying value for certain of its other reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets altria elected to unconditionally bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a single step quantitative assessment altria used an income approach to estimate the fair values of all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the weightedaverage discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10 

in performing the 2020 discounted cash flow analysis altria made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria’s longterm financial forecast which is used by altria’s management to evaluate business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria’s indefinitelived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2 fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria’s control 

although altria’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions such as continued uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic federal state and local regulatory developments category growth rates consumer preferences success of planned new product expansions competitive activity and income and excise taxes for further discussion of these factors see operating results by business segment  tobacco space  business environment and operating results by business segment  wine segment  business environment below 

while altria’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset at december 31 2020 are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4 

▪ investments in equity securities altria reviews its equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of its investments to their carrying value if the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired and reduced to fair value and the impairment is recognized in the period identified the factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and altria’s intent and ability to hold its investment until recovery 

following share conversion in the fourth quarter of 2020 altria elected to account for its equity investment in juul under the fair value option under this option any cash dividends received and any changes in the fair value of the equity investment in juul which is calculated quarterly using level 3 fair value measurements are included in income losses from equity investments in the consolidated statements of earnings losses the fair value of the equity investment in juul is included in investments in equity securities on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2020 altria believes the fair value option provides quarterly transparency to investors as to the fair market value of altria’s investment in juul given the changes and volatility in the evapor category since altria’s initial investment as well as the lack of publicly available information regarding juul’s business or a marketderived valuation 

prior to share conversion altria accounted for its investment in juul as an investment in an equity security since the juul shares did not have a readily determinable fair value altria elected to measure its investment in juul at its cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer altria reviewed its investment in juul for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators on a 

table of contents 

quarterly basis in connection with the preparation of its financial statements if this qualitative assessment indicated that altria’s investment in juul may be impaired a quantitative assessment was performed if the quantitative assessment indicated the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment was written down to its fair value and the impairment was recognized in the period identified the impairment charges altria recorded related to its investment in juul are included in impairment of juul equity securities in the consolidated statements of earnings losses 

investment in abi 

at december 31 2020 altria’s investment in abi consisted of 185 million restricted shares of abi the “restricted shares” and 12 million ordinary shares of abi the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi is based on i unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for abi’s ordinary shares and was classified in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and ii observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets for the restricted shares and was classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy altria may in certain instances pledge or otherwise grant a security interest in all or part of its restricted shares in the event the pledgee or security interest holder were to foreclose on the restricted shares the encumbered restricted shares will be automatically converted oneforone into ordinary shares therefore the fair value of each restricted share is based on the value of an ordinary share 

the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 138 billion carrying value of 167 billion and 161 billion carrying value of 181 billion respectively which was less than its carrying value by approximately 17 and 11 respectively at december 31 2020 and 2019 at february 22 2021 the fair value of altria’s investment decreased to approximately 128 billion in october 2019 the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi declined below its carrying value and has not recovered altria has evaluated the factors related to the fair value decline including the recent impact on the fair value of abi’s shares during the covid19 pandemic which has negatively impacted abi’s business altria has evaluated the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline at december 31 2020 abi’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and altria’s intent and ability to hold its investment in abi until recovery altria concluded both at december 31 2020 and 2019 that the decline in fair value of its investment in abi below its carrying value was temporary and therefore no impairment was recorded this conclusion was based on the following factors 

▪ the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi historically exceeding its carrying value since october 2016 when altria obtained its ownership interest in abi with the exception of certain periods starting in september 2018 

▪ a history of significant recovery in stock price during 2019 as well as an increase from march 31 2020 to february 22 2021 which altria believes indicates investor confidence in abi’s ability to implement its business strategies and deleveraging plans 

▪ the continued industry disruption and volatility associated with the covid19 pandemic resulting in stock performance among abi competitors that altria does not believe are reflective of actual underlying equity values 

▪ abi’s recent proactive actions to preserve financial flexibility and commitment to its longterm deleveraging initiative including the following actions since december 31 2019 i abi’s 50 reduction to its final 2019 dividend paid in the second quarter of 2020 and its decision to forgo its interim 2020 dividend that would have been paid in the fourth quarter of 2020 ii abi’s completion of the sale of its australia subsidiary in the second quarter of 2020 for 11 billion in cash proceeds iii abi’s continuation of its refinancing efforts through issuance and redemption activity specifically frontend maturities into longer dated maturities and iv abi’s completion of the sale of a minority stake in its usbased metal container plants in the fourth quarter of 2020 for 3 billion in cash proceeds 

▪ abi’s global platform world’s largest brewer by volume and one of the world’s top ten consumer products companies by revenue with strong market positions in key markets new product innovations geographic diversification experienced management team strict financial discipline cost management and efficiency and expected earnings and history of performance and 

▪ the strategic plans implemented by abi in response to the adverse impacts of the covid19 pandemic including its ability to leverage learnings from recovering markets and respond quickly to the evolving environment to better position abi for a robust recovery this was evidenced by abi’s performance in the second half of 2020 which represented improvement over the first half of 2020 and reinforced its confidence in the future potential of the beer category and its business additionally as abi stated in its yearend 2020 earnings report it expects financial results in 2021 to improve meaningfully versus 2020 additionally abi states its 2021 outlook reflects among other factors its current assessment of the scale and magnitude of the covid19 pandemic which is subject to change as it continues to monitor ongoing developments 

altria will continue to monitor its investment in abi including the impact of the covid19 pandemic and subsequent recovery on abi’s business and market valuation if altria were to conclude that the decline in fair value is other than temporary altria would determine and recognize in the period identified the impairment of its investment which could result in a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings  

investment in juul 

in 2020 altria recorded a i noncash pretax impairment charge of 26 billion for three months ended september 30 2020 related to its investment in juul and ii noncash pretax unrealized gain of 100 million for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 

table of contents 

2020 as a result of an increase in the fair value of juul the carrying value of altria’s investment in juul was 17 billion at december 31 2020 

in 2019 altria recorded total noncash pretax impairment charges of 86 billion 45 billion in the third quarter of 2019 and 41 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to its investment in juul resulting in a 42 billion carrying value of its investment in juul at december 31 2019 

altria uses an income approach to estimate the fair value of its investment in juul the income approach reflects the discounting of future cash flows for the us and international markets at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing future cash flows future cash flows are based on a range of scenarios that consider various potential regulatory and market outcomes 

in determining the fair value of its investment in juul in 2020 and 2019 altria made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were sales volume operating margins discount rates and perpetual growth rates all significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 135 to 165 at september 30 2019 195 to 230 at december 31 2019 and 170 to 205 at september 30 2020 and december 31 2020 the perpetual growth rates used in performing each valuation ranged from 05 to 00 additionally in determining these significant assumptions altria made judgments regarding the i likelihood and extent of various potential regulatory actions and the continued adverse public perception impacting the evapor category and specifically juul ii risk created by the number and types of legal cases pending against juul and iii expectations for the future state of the evapor category including competitive dynamics 

although altria’s discounted cash flow analyses were based on assumptions that altria’s management considered reasonable and were based on the best available information at the time that the analyses were developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows if the following factors in isolation significantly deviate from current expectations altria believes that they have the potential to materially impact altria’s significant assumptions of sales volume operating margins discount rate and perpetual growth rate thus potentially materially decreasing altria’s valuation of its investment in juul 

▪ adverse developments related to litigation 

▪ a successful challenge by the ftc in its administrative complaint against altria and juul 

▪ a substantial increase in state and federal evapor excise taxes 

▪ adverse publicity due to underage use of evapor products and other factors 

▪ unanticipated adverse impacts on juul’s relationships with employees customers suppliers and other third parties 

▪ unfavorable financial and market performance including substantial changes in competitive dynamics 

▪ disruption in juul’s current and future plans or operations in domestic and international markets and 

▪ unfavorable regulatory and legislative developments at the international federal state and local levels such as the potential removal of certain evapor products from the market as a result of fda enforcement action or the potential denial of new tobacco product applications for evapor products 

if the following factors in isolation significantly deviate from current expectations altria believes that they have the potential to materially impact altria’s significant assumptions of sales volume operating margins discount rate and perpetual growth rate thus potentially materially increasing altria’s valuation of its investment in juul 

▪ favorable developments related to litigation 

▪ favorable financial and market performance including substantial changes in competitive dynamics 

▪ improvement of public perception around juul and the evapor category and 

▪ favorable regulatory and legislative developments at the international federal state and local levels such as fda authorization of future tobacco product applications for juul flavored evapor products which are currently not permitted in the market without authorization 

while altria’s management believes that the recorded value of its investment in juul at december 31 2020 represents its best estimate of the fair value of the investment juul’s actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance due to changes in the factors noted above additionally the value of altria’s investment in juul could be significantly impacted by changes in the discount rate which could be caused by numerous factors including changes in market inputs as well as risks specific to juul and its litigation environment 

investment in cronos 

the fair value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for cronos’s common shares and was classified in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy the fair value of altria’s equity method investment in cronos 

table of contents 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 11 billion carrying value of 10 billion and 12 billion carrying value of 10 billion respectively which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 8 and 20 at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

for further discussion of altria’s investments in abi juul and cronos see note 6 

▪ marketing costs altria’s businesses promote their products with consumer incentives trade promotions and consumer engagement programs these consumer incentive and trade promotion activities which include discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives do not create a distinct deliverable and are therefore recorded as a reduction of revenues consumer engagement program payments are made to third parties altria’s businesses expense these consumer engagement programs which include event marketing as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing administration and research costs in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings losses for interim reporting purposes altria’s businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies as discussed in note 18 and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various us and foreign jurisdictions against altria and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees and altria’s investees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due in addition pm usa middleton and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume operating income market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales altria’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 47 billion 45 billion and 45 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees 

altria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except to the extent discussed in note 18 and item 3 i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings losses 

▪ employee benefit plans altria provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees including pension postretirement health care and postemployment benefits altria records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets mortality compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings losses are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years 

altria’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations decreased to 27 and 26 respectively at december 31 2020 from 34 for both plans at december 31 2019 resulting from changes in market inputs altria presently anticipates net pretax pension and postretirement income of 85 million in 2021 versus net pretax expense of 3 million in 2020 excluding amounts in each year related to settlement and curtailment this anticipated change is due primarily to i lower interest costs driven by the impact of lower discount rates and ii higher expected return on plan assets due to the higher fair value of plan assets at december 31 2020 this decrease is partially offset by higher amortization of unrecognized losses driven by the impact of lower discount rates assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve a 50 basis point decrease increase in altria’s discount rates would increase decrease altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 10 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 40 million

▪ income taxes significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence that it is morelikelythannot that the deferred tax asset will not be realized in reaching this determination altria considers all available positive and negative evidence including the character of the loss carryback and carryforward considerations future reversals of temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 

altria recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings losses 

altria recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings losses during 2020 2019 and 2018 as a result of various tax events including the impact of the tax reform act

business environment 

summary 

the us tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees and altria’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail in note 18 item 1a and item 3 include 

▪ pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements 

▪ restrictions and requirements imposed by the fsptca and restrictions and requirements and related enforcement actions that have been and in the future will be imposed by the fda 

▪ actual and proposed excise tax increases as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements 

▪ bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers 

▪ other federal state and local government actions including 

▪ restrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes 

▪ additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products 

▪ other actual and proposed tobaccorelated legislation and regulation and 

▪ governmental investigations 

▪ the diminishing prevalence of cigarette smoking 

▪ increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities including retail establishments to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products 

▪ changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior which is influenced by various factors such as economic conditions excise taxes and price gap relationships may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to discount products or other lowerpriced tobacco products 

table of contents 

▪ the highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories including without limitation competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products including evapor and oral nicotine pouch products 

▪ illicit trade in tobacco products 

▪ potential adverse changes in prices availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials and components and 

▪ the covid19 pandemic 

in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for altria’s tobacco subsidiaries altria’s tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch among tobacco categories use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products such as evapor products and oral nicotine pouches adult smokers continue to convert from cigarettes to exclusive use of noncombustible tobacco product alternatives up until the second half of 2019 the evapor category had experienced significant growth and the number of adults who exclusively used evapor products also increased during that time which along with growth in oral nicotine pouches negatively impacted consumption levels and sales volume of cigarettes and mst while growth of oral nicotine pouches has continued including the introduction of unregulated synthetic nicotine pouches growth in the evapor category has been negatively impacted by the legislative and regulatory activities discussed below the evapor category has also become increasingly competitive altria and its tobacco subsidiaries believe the innovative tobacco products categories in particular evapor will continue to be dynamic as adult tobacco consumers explore a variety of tobacco product options and as the regulatory environment for these innovative tobacco products evolves 

domestic cigarette industry volume for 2020 was unchanged versus the prior year which altria believes was the result of stayathome practices due to the covid19 pandemic and higher tobacco discretionary spending due to the expected continued market volatility as a result of various factors relating to the covid19 pandemic and crosscategory movement altria is not providing a cigarette industry volume forecast at this time altria believes the degree of ongoing crosscategory movement will be influenced by several factors including adult consumer perceptions of the relative risks of noncombustible products compared to cigarettes fda determinations on product applications and legislative actions 

economic conditions also impact adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior prior economic downturns have resulted in adult tobacco consumers choosing discount products and other lowerpriced tobacco products although the current economic downturn resulting from the covid19 pandemic has not meaningfully increased the growth of discount and lower priced tobacco products in part due to stimulus payments adult tobacco consumers may still increasingly choose these products as economic conditions remain unfavorable see executive summary in item 7 above for further discussion 

altria and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the us through innovation and adjacency growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties 

fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca its implementing regulations and its 2016 deeming regulations establish broad fda regulatory authority over all tobacco products and among other provisions 

▪ impose restrictions on the advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products see final tobacco marketing rule below 

▪ establish premarket review pathways for new and modified tobacco products see premarket review pathways for tobacco products and market authorization enforcement below 

▪ prohibit any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without fda authorization 

▪ authorize the fda to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health and 

▪ equip the fda with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools including the authority to inspect product manufacturing and other facilities 

the fsptca also bans descriptors such as “light” “low” or “mild” when used as descriptors of modified risk unless expressly authorized by the fda in connection with a 2016 lawsuit initiated by middleton the department of justice on behalf of the fda informed middleton that at present the fda does not intend to bring an enforcement action against middleton for the use of the term “mild” in the trademark “black  mild” consequently middleton dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice if the fda were to change its position at some later date middleton would have the opportunity to bring another lawsuit 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca in march 2010 the fda promulgated a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco 1 products the “final tobacco marketing rule” the may 

1 “smokeless tobacco” as used in this section of this form 10k refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the fda in 2009 including mst it excludes oral nicotine pouches which were first regulated by the fda in 2016 

table of contents 

2016 deeming regulations amended the final tobacco marketing rule to expand specific provisions to all tobacco products including cigars pipe tobacco and evapor and oral nicotine products containing tobaccoderived nicotine or other tobacco derivatives but do not include any component or part that is not made or derived from tobacco 

the final tobacco marketing rule as amended among other things 

▪ restricts the use of nontobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products 

▪ prohibits sampling of all tobacco products except that sampling of smokeless tobacco products is permitted in qualified adultonly facilities 

▪ prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with cigarette or smokeless tobacco brands or logos 

▪ prohibits cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic musical artistic or other social or cultural event or any entry or team in any event and 

▪ requires the development by the fda of graphic warnings for cigarettes establishes warning requirements for other tobacco products and gives the fda the authority to require new warnings for any type of tobacco product see fda regulatory actions  graphic warnings below 

subject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for all other tobacco products 

▪ rulemaking and guidance from time to time the fda issues proposed rules or guidance which may be issued in draft or final form generally involve public comment and may include scientific review the fda also may request comments on broad topics through an anprm altria’s tobacco subsidiaries actively engage with the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda policies and proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

the fda’s implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by us states territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect the ability of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ fda’s comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation in july 2017 the fda announced a “comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation” “comprehensive plan” designed to strike a balance between regulation and encouraging the development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes since then the fda has issued additional information about its comprehensive plan in response to concerns associated with the rise in the use of evapor products by youth and the potential youth appeal of flavored tobacco products see underage access and use of certain tobacco products below as part of the comprehensive plan the fda 

▪ issued anprms relating to potential product standards for nicotine in cigarettes flavors in all tobacco products including menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in all cigars and for evapor products to protect against known public health risks such as concerns about youth exposure to liquid nicotine 

▪ took actions to restrict youth access to evapor products 

▪ reconsidered the processes used by the fda to review certain reports and new product applications and 

▪ revisited the timelines previously extended by the fda to submit applications for tobacco products first regulated by the fda in 2016 

▪ premarket review pathways for tobacco products and market authorization enforcement the fsptca permits the sale of tobacco products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 and not subsequently modified “grandfathered products” and new or modified products authorized through the pmta substantial equivalence “se” or se exemption pathways 

the fda premarket authorization enforcement policy varies based on product type and date of availability in the market specifically 

▪ all tobacco products on the market as of february 15 2007 and not subsequently modified are grandfathered products and exempt from the premarket authorization requirement 

▪ cigarette and smokeless tobacco products that were modified or first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and march 22 2011 are generally considered “provisional products” for which se reports were required to be filed by march 22 2011 these reports must demonstrate that the product has the same characteristics as a product on the market as of february 15 2007 or to a product previously determined to be substantially equivalent or has different characteristics but does not raise different questions of public health and 

▪ tobacco products that were first regulated by the fda in 2016 including cigars evapor products and oral nicotine pouches that are not grandfathered products are generally products for which either an se report or pmta needed to be filed by september 9 2020 

table of contents 

modifications to currently marketed products including modifications that result from for example changes to the quantity of tobacco products in a package a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients also can trigger the fda’s premarket review process 

provisional products  most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by pm usa and usstc are provisional products altria’s subsidiaries timely submitted se reports for these provisional products pm usa and usstc have received se determinations on certain provisional products those that were found to be not substantially equivalent certain smokeless tobacco products had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the fda’s determinations therefore those determinations did not impact business results pm usa and usstc have other provisional products that continue to be subject to the fda’s premarket review process in the meantime they can continue marketing these products unless the fda determines that a specific provisional product is not substantially equivalent 

in addition the fda has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of provisional product se reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can generally continue to be legally marketed without further fda review pm usa and usstc have provisional products included in this subset of products 

while altria’s cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries believe their current provisional products meet the statutory requirements of the fsptca they cannot predict how the fda will ultimately apply law regulation and guidance to their various se reports should altria’s cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries receive unfavorable determinations on any se reports currently pending with the fda they believe they can replace the vast majority of their respective product volumes with other fda authorized products or with grandfathered products 

nonprovisional products  cigarette and smokeless tobacco products introduced into the market or modified after march 22 2011 are “nonprovisional products” and must receive a marketing order from the fda prior to being offered for sale marketing orders for nonprovisional products may be obtained by filing an se report pmta or using another premarket pathway established by the fda 

products regulated in 2016  manufacturers of products first regulated by the fda in 2016 including cigars oral nicotine pouches and evapor products that were on the market as of august 8 2016 and not subsequently modified must have filed an se report or pmta by the filing deadline of september 9 2020 in order for their products to remain on the market at the fda’s discretion these products can remain on the market during fda review for up to one year from the date of the application with additional casebycase discretion to remain on the market after that time so long as the report or application was timely filed with the fda for products new or modified not on the market as of august 8 2016 manufacturers must file an se report or pmta and receive fda authorization prior to marketing the product 

helix submitted pmtas for on oral nicotine pouches on may 15 2020 which are presently under review by the fda if the fda does not authorize one or more on pmtas the fda may require helix to remove the affected products from the market which could have a material adverse effect on helix’s business middleton has received market orders or exemptions that cover over 97 of its cigar product volume and filed se reports for its remaining cigar product volume by the filing deadline 

in december 2013 altria’s subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with pmi including an agreement that grants altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of pmi’s heated tobacco products in the united states subject to fda authorization of the applicable products pmi submitted a pmta and a modified risk tobacco product application with the fda for its electronically heated tobacco products comprising the iqos tobacco heating system  in april 2019 the fda authorized the pmta for the iqos tobacco heating system and in july 2020 the fda authorized the marketing of this system as a modified risk tobacco product with a reduced exposure claim the iqos electronic device heats but does not burn tobacco in december 2020 the fda authorized the pmta for iqos 3 an updated version of the iqos tobacco heating system  the modified risk tobacco products authorization “mrtp” for the original iqos electronic device currently does not apply to the iqos 3 device pmi has disclosed that it plans to seek an mrtp for the iqos 3 electronic device in the future 

postmarket surveillance  manufacturers that receive product authorizations through the pmta process must submit to the fda postmarket records and reports as detailed in market orders the fda may withdraw a market order based on this information if among other reasons it determines that the continued marketing of the product is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health 

effect of adverse fda determinations  fda review time frames have varied it is therefore difficult to predict the duration of fda reviews of se reports or pmtas failure of manufacturers to submit applications by the applicable deadline an unfavorable determination on an application or the withdrawal by the fda of a prior marketing order could result in the removal of products from the market these manufacturers would have the option of marketing products that have received fda premarket authorization or grandfathered products a “not substantially equivalent” determination a denial of a pmta or a marketing order withdrawal by the fda on one or more products could have a material adverse impact on the business and consolidated results of operations of our tobacco subsidiaries and investees and the cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

table of contents 

▪ fda regulatory actions 

▪ graphic warnings  in march 2020 the fda issued a final rule requiring 11 textual warnings accompanied by color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking on cigarette packaging and advertising the final rule requires that the graphic health warnings i be located beneath the cellophane and comprise the top 50 of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and ii occupy 20 of a cigarette advertisement and be located at the top of the advertisement as a result of a court order related to the covid19 pandemic and an additional court ruling in december 2020 resulting from a lawsuit brought by rj reynolds tobacco company “rj reynolds” and others against the fda the final rule will be effective january 14 2022 pm usa and other cigarette manufacturers have filed lawsuits challenging the final rule on substantive and procedural grounds 

in the preamble to the final rule the fda stated that it would not exempt heatsticks  a heated tobacco product used with the iqos electronic device as part of the rulemaking but would consider the heatsticks marketing order and other marketing orders on a casebycase basis 

▪ underage access and use of certain tobacco products  the fda announced regulatory actions in september 2018 to address underage access and use of evapor products altria has engaged with the fda on this topic and has reaffirmed to the fda its ongoing and longstanding commitment to preventing underage use for example during 2019 altria advocated raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels to further address underage use which is now federal law see federal state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products below for further discussion 

in march 2019 the fda issued draft guidance further proposing restrictions to address youth evapor use this guidance which the fda finalized in january 2020 states that the fda intends to prioritize enforcement action against 

▪ cartridgebased flavored evapor products other than tobacco and menthol flavors unless such products have received market authorization from the fda and 

▪ all evapor products in any format or flavor 

▪ for which a manufacturer has failed or is failing to take adequate measures to prevent access by those under the age of 21 referred to in the fda guidance as “minors” 

▪ targeted to minors and the marketing for which is likely to promote use of such products by minors or 

▪ offered for sale after the courtordered filing deadline and for which the manufacturer has either not submitted a pmta or for which an application was timely filed but an adverse decision on the application was issued by the fda 

evapor product manufacturers however may continue to file pmtas for flavored tobacco products fda enforcement action could result in tobacco products being removed from the market unless and until these products receive premarket authorization from the fda juul ceased its sales of all cartridgebased flavored evapor products other than tobacco and menthol in 2019 if fda enforcement action is taken against currently marketed juul evapor products and a significant number of those products are removed from the market or if the fda does not ultimately allow for the reintroduction of flavors other than tobacco and menthol it could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul and have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

the january 2020 guidance effectively permits the continued sale subject to the exceptions discussed above of certain flavored evapor products including flavored disposable evapor products if as a result these flavored evapor products are sold in higher volumes than juul’s evapor products it could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul and have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

▪ potential product standards 

▪ nicotine in cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products  in march 2018 the fda issued an anprm seeking comments on the potential public health benefits and any possible adverse effects of lowering nicotine in combustible cigarettes to nonaddictive or minimally addictive levels among other issues the fda sought comments on i whether smokers would compensate by smoking more cigarettes to obtain the same level of nicotine as with their current product and ii whether the proposed rule would create an illicit trade of cigarettes containing nicotine at levels higher than a nonaddictive threshold that may be established by the fda the fda also sought comments on whether a nicotine product standard should apply to other combustible tobacco products including cigars were the fda to develop and finalize a product standard for nicotine in combustible products and if the standard was appealed and upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ flavors in tobacco products  as discussed above under fda’s comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation  the fda indicated that it is considering proposing rulemaking for a product standard that would seek to ban menthol in combustible tobacco products including cigarettes and cigars and that it intends to propose a product standard that would ban 

table of contents 

characterizing flavors in all cigars including grandfathered products and those that have received se determinations from the fda  an intention reiterated in the fda’s january 2020 guidance in march 2018 the fda issued an anprm seeking comments on the role if any that flavors including menthol in tobacco products may play in attracting youth and in helping some smokers switch to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery in the context of litigation the fda has stated its intention to issue a response by april 29 2021 to a 2013 citizen petition requesting fda prohibit menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes 

while the fda has yet to define “characterizing flavors” with respect to cigars most of middleton’s cigar products contain added flavors and may be subject to any action by the fda to ban flavors in cigars the fda also may ban characterizing flavors in all other tobacco products including oral nicotine pouches if these regulations become final and are appealed and upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business of our tobacco subsidiaries and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ nnn in smokeless tobacco  in january 2017 the fda proposed a product standard for nnitrosonornicotine “nnn” levels in finished smokeless tobacco products if the proposed rule in present form were to become final and was appealed and upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and usstc 

▪ good manufacturing practices the fsptca requires that the fda promulgate good manufacturing practice regulations referred to by the fda as “requirements for tobacco product manufacturing practice” for tobacco product manufacturers but does not specify a timeframe for such regulations compliance with any such regulations could result in increased costs which may have a material adverse effect on the financial position of altria its tobacco subsidiaries and its investees including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs and user fees fda regulatory actions under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries in various ways for example actions by the fda could 

▪ impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products 

▪ delay discontinue or prevent the sale or distribution of existing new or modified tobacco products 

▪ limit adult tobacco consumer choices 

▪ impose restrictions on communications with adult tobacco consumers 

▪ create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies 

▪ impose additional manufacturing labeling or packaging requirements 

▪ impose additional restrictions at retail 

▪ result in increased illicit trade in tobacco products andor

the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions also could have a material adverse effect on the business of our tobacco subsidiaries and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

the fsptca imposes user fees on cigarette cigarette tobacco smokeless tobacco cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the fsptca does not impose user fees on evapor or oral nicotine pouch manufacturers the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda user fees and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares all as prescribed by the fsptca and fda regulations payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the fda user fee payments on altria see debt and liquidity  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for altria’s tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material either individually or in the aggregate to one or more of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries

excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the us significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the us including as a result of the covid19 pandemic as a way for governments to address potential budget shortfalls the frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors including the composition of executive and legislative bodies 

federal state and local cigarette excise taxes have increased substantially over the past two decades far outpacing the rate of inflation between the end of 1998 and february 22 2021 the weightedaverage state cigarette excise tax increased from 036 to 187 per pack as of february 22 2021 one state maryland has enacted new legislation increasing cigarette excise taxes in 2021 but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed 

a majority of states currently tax mst using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria’s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on mst to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 22 2021 the federal government 23 states puerto rico philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for mst 

an increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on evapor and oral nicotine pouches as of february 22 2021 28 states the district of columbia puerto rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax evapor products these taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the evapor product form similarly 10 states and the district of columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches tax increases could have an adverse impact on the sales of these products 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and mst products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the sales volume and reported share performance of cigarettes and mst products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 22 2021 181 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the us is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobaccorelated issues 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the us either indirectly or as a result of the us becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 18 during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation operating income market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements on altria see debt and liquidity  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below and note 18 the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities the state settlement agreements also place restrictions on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products and prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and us territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa

other international federal state and local regulation and governmental and private activity 

▪ international federal state and local regulation a number of states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products including cigarettes smokeless tobacco cigars evapor products and oral nicotine pouches such as legislation that 1 prohibits the sale of tobacco product categories such as evapor 2 prohibits the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors such as menthol cigarettes 3 requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and 4 restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products including proposals to ban all tobacco product sales the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions for example a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint or wintergreenflavored products as of february 22 2021 19 states and the district of columbia have proposed legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products and five states california massachusetts new jersey utah and new york have passed such legislation some of these states such as new york and utah exempt certain products that have received fda market authorization through the pmta pathway the legislation in california bans the sale of most tobacco products with characterizing flavors including menthol mint and wintergreen following enactment of the flavor ban in august 2020 several registered california voters filed a referendum against the legislation in january 2021 the requisite number of registered california voters over 600000 registered voters were required signed a petition to place the question of whether the legislation should be affirmed or overturned on the next statewide general election ballot which will likely take place in 2022 unless a special statewide election is called earlier as a result the implementation of the legislation is delayed until after a vote on the referendum occurs altria’s tobacco operating companies in conjunction with other companies funded this referendum effort additionally in october 2020 altria’s tobacco operating companies along with several other parties including rj reynolds filed a lawsuit challenging the flavor ban and seeking to enjoin its implementation massachusetts passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in evapor products similar legislation is pending in three other states 

restrictions on evapor products also have been instituted or proposed internationally for example india and singapore have instituted bans on evapor products 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries have challenged and will continue to challenge certain federal state and local legislation and other governmental action including through litigation it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ federal state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products after a number of states and localities proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products including evapor products in december 2019 the federal government passed legislation increasing the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products including evapor products to 21 nationwide although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on sales volume of our tobacco businesses as discussed above under underage access and use of certain tobacco products altria supported raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels reflecting its longstanding commitment to combat underage use 

▪ health effects of tobacco products including evapor products reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including various reports by the us surgeon general in 2019 there were public health advisories concerning vapingrelated lung injuries and deaths and more recently there have been health concerns raised about potential increased risks associated with covid19 among smokers and vapers altria and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the us surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products 

most jurisdictions within the us have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting children it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on legislation and regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example amid the covid19 pandemic state and local governments have required additional health and safety requirements of all businesses including tobacco manufacturing and other facilities state and local governments also have mandated the temporary closure of some businesses it is possible that tobacco manufacturing and other facilities could be subject to these governmentmandated temporary closures additionally in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes require tax

stamping of smokeless tobacco products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ governmental investigations from time to time altria its subsidiaries and investees are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters for example i the ftc issued a civil investigative demand “cid” to altria while conducting its antitrust review of altria’s investment in juul seeking information regarding among other things altria’s role in the resignation of juul’s former chief executive officer and the hiring by juul of any current or former altria director executive or employee ii the us securities and exchange commission “sec” commenced an investigation relating to altria’s acquisition disclosures and accounting controls in connection with the juul investment and iii the new york state office of the attorney general issued a subpoena to altria seeking documents relating to altria’s investment in and provision of services to juul additionally juul is currently under investigation by various federal and state agencies including the sec the fda and the ftc and state attorneys general such investigations vary in scope but at least some appear to include juul’s marketing practices particularly as such practices relate to youth and altria may be asked in the context of those investigations to provide information concerning its investment in juul or relating to its marketing of nu mark llc evapor products 

private sector activity on evapor 

a number of retailers including national chains have discontinued the sale of evapor products reasons for the discontinuation include reported illnesses related to evapor product use and the uncertain regulatory environment it is possible that this private sector activity could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul and have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

illicit trade in tobacco products 

illicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of altria its tobacco subsidiaries and investees illicit trade can take many forms including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products the sale of tobacco products in the us that are intended for sale outside the country the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another counterfeit tobacco products for example are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments counterfeit versions of our tobacco subsidiaries’ and investees’ products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands illicit trade in tobacco products also harms lawabiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels moreover illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal state and local governments losing tax revenues losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions including increasing excise taxes imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact altria’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul and the businesses of its tobacco subsidiaries and investees or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and when necessary litigate to protect their trademarks 

price availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials and component parts 

shifts in crops such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns government restrictions and mandated prices economic trade sanctions import duties and tariffs geopolitical instability and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco and other raw materials or component parts used to manufacture our companies’ products any significant change in the price quality or availability of tobacco other raw materials or component parts used to manufacture our products could restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our subsidiaries’ profitability and businesses 

with respect to tobacco as with other agricultural commodities crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change additionally the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand economic conditions including the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic are unpredictable which among other economic factors may result in changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production which could impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply tobacco production in certain countries also is

subject to a variety of controls including governmentmandated prices and production control programs moreover certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies including geographies experiencing political instability or government prohibitions on the import or export of tobacco and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries’ ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability 

the covid19 pandemic also may limit access to and increase the cost of raw materials component parts and personal protective equipment as us and global suppliers temporarily shut down facilities in order to address exposure to the virus or as a result of a government mandate 

timing of sales 

in the ordinary course of business our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events the timing of promotions customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and taxdriven price increases

in december 2018 altria refocused its innovative product efforts which included the discontinuation of production and distribution of all evapor products by nu mark  prior to that time nu mark was engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products 

▪ distribution competition and raw materials altria’s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors and large retail organizations including chain stores 

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions product promotions coupons and other discounts 

the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act “fsptca” provides the fda with broad authority to regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products the authority to require disclosures of related information and the authority to enforce the fsptca and related regulations the fsptca went into effect in 2009 for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for all other tobacco products including cigars evapor products pipe tobacco and oral nicotine products “other tobacco products” the fsptca imposes restrictions on the advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products including at retail pm usa middleton nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of the fsptca their respective fda user fee amounts are determined by an allocation formula administered by the fda that is based on the respective market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product pm usa nat sherman usstc and other us tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions for further discussion of these restrictions see tobacco space  business environment in item 7

wine 

ste michelle is a producer and supplier of premium varietal and blended table wines and of sparkling wines ste michelle is a leading producer of washington state wines primarily chateau ste michelle and 14 hands  and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other domestic and foreign wine regions ste michelle’s total 2019 wine shipment volume of approximately 83 million cases increased 06 from 2018

▪ distribution competition and raw materials key elements of ste michelle’s strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines especially in certain account categories such as restaurants wholesale clubs supermarkets wine shops and mass merchandisers and a focus on improving product mix to higherpriced premium products 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including competition from many larger wellestablished domestic and international companies as well as from many smaller wine producers wine segment competition is primarily based on quality price consumer and trade wine tastings competitive wine judging thirdparty acclaim and advertising substantially all of ste michelle’s sales occur in the united states through statelicensed distributors ste michelle also sells to domestic consumers through retail and ecommerce channels and exports wines to international distributors 

adult consumer preferences among alcohol categories and within the wine category can shift due to a variety of factors including changes in taste preferences demographics or social trends and changes in leisure dining and beverage consumption patterns evolving adult consumer preferences pose challenges to the wine category which has seen slowing volume growth in the premium wine category and increases in inventory levels 

federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the beverage alcohol industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing rules labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages could have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production at the present time ste michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements see item 1a for a discussion of risks associated with competition consumer preferences unfavorable changes in grape supply and governmental regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our results of operations our cash flows our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

we 1 may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec reports to security holders press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans estimates and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this annual report on form 10k particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses below in item 7 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

 

1 this section uses the terms “we” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees 

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria and its subsidiaries including pm usa and usstc as well as their respective indemnitees and altria’s investees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability unfair trade practices antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors shareholders and distributors 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases have ranged in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome 

in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 19  contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 19 ” tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation altria its subsidiaries and its investees may face potentially significant nonmonetary remedies for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in detail in note 19  the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” 

additionally the on transaction discussed in note 1  background and basis of presentation to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 1 ” is the subject of pending arbitration an unfavorable decision could adversely affect helix’s ability to compete effectively with oral nicotine pouches 

in 2019 we determined that our investment in juul was impaired in part due to the increase in the number and type of legal cases pending against juul especially in the fourth quarter of 2019 this impairment and the risks associated with our juul investment are discussed further in the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all  

altria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain 

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries or investees could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria to do so see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k “item 3” note 19 and exhibits 991 and 992 to this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

significant federal state and local governmental actions including actions by the fda and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on us and our tobacco subsidiaries’ or our investees’ businesses and sales volumes 

as described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7 our cigarette subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector actions including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold these subsidiaries responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke these actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels 

more broadly actions by the fda and other federal state or local governments or agencies including those specific actions described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7  may impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products 

for example through product standards that may be proposed by the fda for nicotine and flavors limit adult tobacco consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace for example as a result of product contamination rulemaking that bans menthol or other flavors a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence because the fda requires that a currently marketed tobacco product proceed through the premarket review process or because the fda otherwise determines that removal is necessary for the protection of public health restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting altria’s investment in juul see tobacco space  business environment in item 7 for a more detailed discussion 

tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the federal state and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes in item 7  

our tobacco businesses face significant competition including across categories and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria or the business of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

each of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories this competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve significant methods of competition include product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging distribution and promotional activities this highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria see tobacco space  business environment  summary in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences including evapor products growth of the evapor product category and other innovative tobacco products has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and has adversely affected the growth rates of other tobacco products continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

pm usa also faces competition from lowerpriced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states these settlements among other factors resulted in substantial cigarette price increases these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowerpriced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands 

altria and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of altria or the business of altria’s tobacco and wine subsidiaries 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 



see tobacco space  business environment  summary in item 7 and the immediately preceding risk factor for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences specifically the growth of evapor and other innovative tobacco products and the effects on our tobacco operating companies 

see wine segment  business environment  summary in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult alcohol consumer preferences specifically the slowing of the premium wine category and the effects on our wine subsidiaries 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries while our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products the failure to do so could negatively impact our companies’ ability to compete in these circumstances 

our financial services business conducted through pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation real estate and manufacturing equipment its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams andor put them at a competitive disadvantage 

altria and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences examples include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful such as electronically heated tobacco products oral nicotine pouches such as helix’s on products and evapor products in addition to internal product development these efforts include arrangements with or investments in third parties such as our exclusive arrangement with pmi to sell iqos and related heatstick products in the united states which is dependent upon our continued ability to license these products from pmi and our minority investment in juul our minority investment in juul subjects us to noncompetition obligations restricting us from investing or engaging in the evapor business other than through juul subject to certain exceptions our tobacco subsidiaries and investees may not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize these adjacent products which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams 

further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of innovative products including products with claims of reduced risk to adult consumers the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products see tobacco space  business environment  fsptca and fda regulation in item 7 for further discussion nor can we predict whether these products will appeal to adult tobacco consumers or whether adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing decisions would be affected by reducedrisk claims on such products if permitted adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products 

if our tobacco subsidiaries or investees do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products including with claims of reduced risk but one or more of their competitors does succeed our tobacco subsidiaries or investees may be at a competitive disadvantage which could have an adverse effect on their financial performance 

significant changes in price availability or quality of tobacco other raw materials or component parts could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

any significant change in prices quality or availability of tobacco other raw materials or component parts could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for further discussion see tobacco space  business environment  price availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials and component parts in item 7  

because altria’s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers for example the richmond virginia manufacturing facility is the primary facility for manufacturing all pm usa cigarettes and some of our other tobacco products a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries the operations of any key supplier of any of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries or any other disruption in the supply of goods or services from a key supplier including a key supplier’s inability to comply with government regulations or unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended disruption in operations experienced 

by one or more of altria’s subsidiaries or in the supply of goods or services by a key supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria’s subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products which could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

in addition to a recall required by the fda as referenced above our subsidiaries could decide or other laws or regulations could require them to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

the failure of altria’s information systems or service providers’ information systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

altria and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers such as cloud providers to support a variety of business processes and activities including complying with regulatory legal financial reporting and tax requirements engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations manufacturing and distributing our products collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information and communicating internally and externally with employees investors suppliers trade customers adult consumers and others we continue to make investments in administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyberthreats including human error and malicious acts our safeguards include employee training testing and auditing protocols backup systems and business continuity plans maintenance of security policies and procedures monitoring of networks and systems and thirdparty risk management 

to date interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations however because technology is increasingly complex and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future failure of our systems or service providers’ systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands operational disruptions legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria and its subsidiaries 

unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria and its subsidiaries or its investees 

from time to time altria its subsidiaries and its investees are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters for further discussion see tobacco space  business environment  other international federal state and local regulation and governmental and private activity in item 7 we cannot predict the outcome of any such investigation and it is possible that our business or the businesses of our investees could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of a future investigation 

a challenge to our tax positions could adversely affect our tax rate earnings or cash flow 

tax laws and regulations such as the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” are complex and subject to varying interpretations a successful challenge to one or more of altria’s tax positions could give rise to additional liabilities including interest and potential penalties as well as adversely affect our tax rate earnings or cash flows 

international business operations subject altria and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

while altria and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees investees or third parties violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

altria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria’s credit rating and altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction 

from time to time altria considers acquisitions investments or dispositions and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings 

over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition investment disposition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in juul although we continue to maintain investment grade ratings any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and also may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment additionally there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our businesses or investments on favorable terms which may result in a loss in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings 

disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect altria’s access to these markets earnings and dividend rate 

access to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability pricing credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

altria may be required to write down intangible assets including goodwill due to impairment which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets if an impairment is determined to exist in either situation we will incur impairment losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in the fourth quarter of 2018 altria incurred 209 million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to altria’s decision to refocus its innovative product efforts and the impairment of the columbia crest trademark in the fourth quarter of 2019 in the wine segment altria determined that the goodwill of 74 million was fully impaired as the wine reporting unit was impacted by a slowing growth rate in the premium wine category and higher inventory levels see note 4  goodwill and other intangible assets net to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 4 ” for further discussion 

competition changes in adult consumer preferences unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies ste michelle’s business also is impacted by evolving adult consumer preferences shifts away from the wine category to other alcohol categories or shifts to lowerpriced wines have resulted and could continue to result in slowing growth in ste michelle’s sales and higher inventory levels and have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages or surpluses related to any one or more of these factors could impact production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment in item 7 

antitrust clearance required for the conversion of our nonvoting juul shares into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all 

antitrust clearance required for the conversion of the nonvoting juul shares held by us into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all and such clearance may be subject to unanticipated conditions the federal trade commission “ftc” may challenge the investment through litigation or administrative proceedings potentially seeking a range of resolutions such as modifications to the investment structure or economic terms up to divestiture of the investment in april 2019 altria and juul received a request for additional information commonly referred to as a “second request” from the ftc as part of the antitrust review process a second request extends the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended the “hsr act” while the ftc conducts its review until 30 days after the parties have substantially complied with the second request or as otherwise agreed to by the parties as of october 30 2019 altria and juul certified substantial compliance with the second request based on the timing agreement among altria juul and the ftc staff and related extensions for the convenience of the parties altria believes the ftc will complete its review in the first half of 2020 while conducting its review on october 1 2019 the ftc issued a civil investigative demand to altria seeking information regarding among other things altria’s role in the resignation of juul’s former chief executive officer and the hiring by juul of any current or former altria director executive or employee 

unless and until antitrust clearance is obtained including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act our juul shares will not have voting rights and we will not be entitled to certain other rights including the right to appoint any directors to the juul 

board of directors accordingly failure to obtain antitrust clearance including a successful litigation challenge by the ftc to the investment would adversely affect us including by substantially limiting our rights with respect to our investment in juul 

the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all 

regardless of whether antitrust clearance is obtained the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all including due to the risks encountered by juul in its business such as operational risks and regulatory risks at the international federal state and local levels including actions by the fda and adverse publicity due to underage use of evapor products and other factors unanticipated impacts on juul’s relationships with employees customers suppliers and other third parties potential disruptions to juul’s management or current or future plans and operations or domestic or international litigation developments investigations or otherwise as discussed in note 19 juul and altria andor its subsidiaries including pm usa are named as defendants in various individual and class action lawsuits juul also is named in a significant number of additional individual and class action lawsuits to which neither altria nor its subsidiaries is a party see tobacco space  business environment in item 7 for a discussion of certain fdarelated regulatory risks applicable to the evapor category including the potential removal of certain evapor products from the market as a result of fda enforcement action and the potential denial of new tobacco product applications for evapor products failure to realize the expected benefits of our juul investment could adversely affect the value of the investment 

as discussed in note 7  in 2019 as part of the preparation of our financial statements for the periods ended september 30 2019 and december 31 2019 we performed valuations of our investment in juul as a result we determined that our investment in juul was impaired and recorded a total pretax impairment charge of 86 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 reported as impairment of juul equity securities in our consolidated statements of earnings of this amount altria recorded pretax charges of 45 billion in the third quarter of 2019 and 41 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 the third quarter impairment charge was due primarily to lower evapor sales volume assumptions in the us and international markets and a delay in achieving operating margin performance as compared to the assumptions at the time of the juul transaction the fourth quarter impairment charge resulted substantially from increased discount rates applied to future cash flow projections due to the increase in the number and type of legal cases pending against juul during the fourth quarter of 2019 while we believe the december 31 2019 valuation of 42 billion is the appropriate current fair value of our investment the risks identified in this paragraph some of which are also further discussed in note 19 and in item 7 tobacco space  business environment  are ongoing with respect to the current fair value if the fair value of our investment in juul continues to decrease it could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

our investment in juul includes noncompetition standstill and transfer restrictions that prevent us from gaining control of juul furthermore if we elect not to extend our noncompetition obligations beyond december 20 2024 we would lose certain of our governance consent preemptive and other rights with respect to our investment in juul 

the shares of juul we hold generally cannot be sold or otherwise transferred until december 20 2024 subject to limited exceptions we also generally agreed not to compete with juul in the evapor category until at least december 20 2024 which may be extended at our election if however juul is prohibited by federal law from selling evapor products in the us for at least one year or if altria’s carrying value of the juul investment is not more than 10 of its initial carrying value of 128 billion we may compete with juul in the evapor category prior to december 20 2024 in addition following receipt of antitrust clearance juul’s board of directors will include nine members three of whom will be designated by altria including one independent designee juul’s strategy and its material decisions are not and will not be controlled by us and the terms of our agreements with juul mean that we are required to bear the risks associated with our investment in juul until at least december 20 2024 subject to the exceptions mentioned above further if we elect not to extend our noncompetition obligations beyond that date we would lose some or all of our board designation rights preemptive rights consent rights and other rights with respect to our investment in juul loss of these rights could adversely affect us by impairing our ability to influence juul 

altria’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in abi and the dividends paid by abi on shares owned by altria may be adversely affected by various factors including foreign currency exchange rates and abi’s business results and stock price 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi are translated into us dollars “usd” from various local currencies in addition abi pays dividends in euros which we convert into usd during times of a strengthening usd against these currencies our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer usd and the dividends that we receive from abi will convert into fewer usd 

dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi are also subject to the risks encountered by abi in its business for example in october 2018 abi announced a 50 rebase in the dividends it pays to its shareholders which has resulted in a reduction of cash dividends altria receives from abi in addition if the carrying value of our investment in abi exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings we cannot provide any assurance that abi will successfully execute its business plans and strategies earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in abi are also subject to fluctuations in abi’s stock price for example through marktomarket losses on abi’s derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain share commitments 

we received a substantial portion of our consideration from the abi transaction in the form of restricted shares subject to a fiveyear lockup furthermore if our percentage ownership in abi were to decrease below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities suffer a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the abi board of directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 

upon completion of the abi transaction we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the abi transaction subject to limited exceptions these transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in abi for a fiveyear period that expires on october 10 2021 further in the event that our ownership percentage in abi were to decrease below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the abi board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and our use of the equity method of accounting for our investment in abi could be challenged 

the tax treatment of the consideration altria received in the abi transaction may be challenged and the tax treatment of the abi investment may not be as favorable as altria anticipates 

while we expect the equity consideration that we received from the abi transaction to qualify for taxdeferred treatment we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and if they do what the outcome of any such challenge will be in addition there is a risk that the tax treatment of our investment in abi may not be as favorable as we anticipate 

the expected benefits of the cronos transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all 

in march 2019 we acquired common shares representing a 45 equity interest in cronos a warrant to acquire common shares representing an additional 10 equity interest in cronos and antidilution protections to purchase cronos shares to maintain our ownership percentage there can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits of the cronos transaction including due to the risks encountered by cronos in its business such as operational risks and legal and regulatory risks unanticipated impacts on cronos’s relationships with third parties its management or its current or future plans and operations due to the cronos transaction or other factors or domestic or international litigation developments tax disputes investigations or otherwise further a failure by cronos or altria to comply with applicable laws including cannabis laws could result in criminal civil or tax liability for altria if the carrying value of our investment in cronos exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8 and the discussion of risk factors that may affect future results in item 1a 

description of the company 

for a description of altria see item 1 business and background in note 1  

altria’s reportable segments are smokeable products smokeless products and wine the financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of pmcc and the relative financial contribution of altria’s innovative tobacco products businesses to altria’s consolidated results 

effective with the first quarter of 2020 altria’s smokeless products segment will be renamed as the oral tobacco products segment altria’s oral tobacco products segment will include financial results volume and retail share performance from usstc’s core mst and snus businesses and helix’s on oral nicotine pouches prior period volume and retail share data will be updated to reflect these changes 

executive summary 

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in altria’s net earnings losses and diluted eps attributable to altria for the year ended december 31 2019  from the year ended december 31 2018  were due primarily to the following 



see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings losses amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 

 partially offset by higher interest and other debt expense net due to debt incurred in connection with the cronos and juul transactions 

for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis 

2020 forecasted results 

altria forecasts that its 2020 fullyear adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 4 to 7 over its 2019 fullyear adjusted diluted eps base of 422 as shown in the table below altria’s 2020 guidance reflects increased investments related to pm usa’s 

commercialization efforts for iqos  helix’s plans to manufacture and expand us distribution of on and one extra shipping day in the first quarter of 2020 

this forecasted growth rate excludes estimated per share charges in 2020 of 005 for tax expense representing a partial reversal of the tax basis benefit recorded in 2017 attributable to the deemed repatriation tax related to altria’s investment in abi for further discussion see note 15  

altria expects its 2020 fullyear adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of 235 to 245 



altria’s fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance and fullyear forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example restructuring charges asset impairment charges acquisitionrelated costs equity investmentrelated special items including any changes in fair value for the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights certain tax items charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items and resolutions of certain nonparticipating manufacturer “npm” adjustment disputes under the 1998 master settlement agreement such dispute resolutions are referred to as “npm adjustment items” and are more fully described in health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes in note 19  

altria’s management cannot estimate on a forwardlooking basis the impact of certain income and expense items including those items noted in the preceding paragraph on altria’s reported diluted eps and its reported effective tax rate because these items which could be significant may be unusual or infrequent are difficult to predict and may be highly variable as a result altria does not provide a corresponding united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” measure for or reconciliation to its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast 

the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast 

while altria reports its financial results in accordance with us gaap its management reviews certain financial results including diluted eps on an adjusted basis which excludes certain income and expense items including those items noted above altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria’s underlying results as they may be highly variable may be unusual or infrequent are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis altria’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with us gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation the consolidated financial statements include altria as well as its whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in which altria currently has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting equity investments in which altria does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for as an investment in an equity security all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

upon antitrust clearance altria expects to account for its equity method investment in juul using the fair value option under the fair value option altria’s consolidated statements of earnings losses will include any cash dividends from its investment in juul and any changes in the fair value of its investment which will be calculated quarterly altria believes the fair value option provides quarterly transparency to investors as to the fair market value of altria’s investment in juul given the changes and volatility in the evapor category since altria’s initial investment as well as the lack of publicly available information regarding juul’s business or a marketderived valuation 

▪ revenue recognition altria’s businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers while altria’s businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type all sales contracts are similarly structured these contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer all performance obligations are satisfied within one year therefore costs to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred and unsatisfied performance obligations are not disclosed there is no financing component because altria’s businesses expect at contract inception that the period between when altria’s businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less 

altria’s businesses define net revenues as revenues which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers net of cash discounts for prompt payment sales returns also referred to as returned goods and sales incentives altria’s businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and valueadded taxes imposed at the time of sale which do not include excise taxes on cigarettes cigars smokeless tobacco or wine billed to customers 

altria’s businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer altria’s businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer altria’s businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings altria’s businesses record an allowance for returned goods based principally on historical volume and return rates which is included in other accrued liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets altria’s businesses record sales incentives which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities as a reduction to revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers retailers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical volume utilization and redemption rates expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets 

payment terms vary depending on product type altria’s businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue which is included in other accrued liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized pm usa receives payment in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product usstc receives substantially all payments within one business day of the customer obtaining control of the product ste michelle receives substantially all payments from customers within 45 days of the customer obtaining control of the product amounts due from customers are included in receivables on altria’s consolidated balance sheets 

for further discussion see note 3  revenues from contracts with customers to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if altria determines that an impairment exists any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

altria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria to perform an interim review if the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a reporting unit but is limited to the total 

amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value in the period identified 

goodwill by reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible assets at december 31 2019 were as follows 



during 2019  altria completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets performed as of october 1 2019 upon completion of this testing altria concluded that the goodwill of 74 million in the wine segment was fully impaired as the wine reporting unit was impacted by a slowing growth rate in the premium wine category and higher inventories in performing the 2019 quantitative annual impairment test for the wine reporting unit altria concluded that the fair value of the unit as a whole was approximately 25 below its carrying value of approximately 15 billion after the impairment charge discussed above altria also evaluated all wine reporting unit assets including current assets property plant and equipment and other longlived assets other than goodwill and concluded that these assets were fairly stated at december 31 2019 

the results of the 2019 quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for the other reporting units and trademarks are indicated below 

the estimated fair values of the cigarettes and cigars reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets within the cigars reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying values 

the estimated fair values of the smokeless products reporting unit and the indefinitelived intangible assets within the reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying values with the exception of the skoal trademark at december 31 2019 the estimated fair value of the skoal trademark exceeded its carrying value of 39 billion by approximately 18 skoal continues to be impacted by slowing category volumes and increased competitive activities due to higher pricing and adult tobacco consumer movement among tobacco products including oral nicotine pouch products 

the estimated fair values of the indefinitelived intangible assets within the wine reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying values with the exception of the patz  hall trademark which at december 31 2019 exceeded its carrying value of 30 million by approximately 11 

during 2018  altria’s quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in 54 million of impairment charges during 2017 altria’s quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges 

in 2019 altria used an income approach to estimate the fair values of all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the weightedaverage discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10 

in performing the 2019 discounted cash flow analysis altria made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria’s longterm financial forecast which is used by altria’s management to evaluate business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria’s indefinitelived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2 fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria’s control 

although altria’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions federal state and local regulatory developments category growth rates consumer preferences success of planned product expansions competitive activity and income and tobaccorelated taxes for further discussion of these factors see operating results by business segment  tobacco space  business environment below 

while altria’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods

investments in abi and cronos 

altria reviews its equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting abi and cronos for impairment on a quarterly basis in connection with the preparation of its financial statements by comparing the fair value of each of its investments to their carrying value if the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired and reduced to fair value and the impairment is recognized in the period identified the factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and altria’s intent and ability to hold its investment until recovery 

the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi at december 31 2019 and 2018 was 161 billion carrying value of 181 billion  and 131 billion carrying value of 177 billion  respectively which was less than its carrying value by 11 and 26 respectively at december 31 2019 and 2018 during 2019 the fair value increased and at september 30 2019 the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi exceeded its carrying value by 4 in october 2019 the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi declined below its carrying value at february 24 2020 the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi was approximately 137 billion approximately 24 below its carrying value altria concluded that the decline in fair value of its investment in abi below its carrying value is temporary and therefore no impairment was recorded this conclusion is based on i the fair value of altria’s equity investment in abi having historically exceeded its carrying value since october 2016 when altria obtained its ownership interest in abi with the exception of certain periods starting in september 2018 ii the period of time that abi shares have traded below altria’s carrying value although abi shares began to trade below altria’s carrying value in september 2018 the fair value of abi’s shares have exceeded altria’s carrying value as recently as september 30 2019 and the magnitude by which the carrying value of altria’s investment in abi exceeds its fair value iii abi’s global platform world’s largest brewer by volume and one of the world’s top five consumer products companies by revenue with strong market positions in key markets geographic diversification experienced management team financial condition expected earnings and history of performance and iv altria’s ownership of restricted shares being subject to a fiveyear lockup subject to limited exceptions ending october 10 2021 which altria believes provides sufficient time to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value of its investment in abi 

if altria were to conclude that the decline in fair value is other than temporary altria would determine and recognize in the period identified the impairment of its investment which could result in a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

the fair value of altria’s acquired common shares in cronos at december 31 2019 was 12 billion compared with its carrying value of 10 billion  at february 24 2020 the fair value of altria’s acquired common shares in cronos was approximately 10 billion which approximates its carrying value altria will continue to assess the fair value of its acquired common shares in cronos to determine if any decline in fair value below its carrying value is other than temporary 

for further discussion of altria’s investments in abi and cronos see note 7  

investment in juul 

altria reviews its investment in juul for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators on a quarterly basis in connection with the preparation of its financial statements if this qualitative assessment indicates that altria’s investment in juul may be impaired a quantitative assessment is performed if the quantitative assessment indicates the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is written down to its fair value and the impairment is recognized in the period identified 

as part of the preparation of its financial statements for the periods ended september 30 2019 and december 31 2019 altria performed its respective qualitative assessments of impairment indicators for its investment in juul and determined that indicators of impairment existed 

at september 30 2019 these indicators included recent significant adverse changes in both the evapor regulatory environment and the industry in which juul operates at december 31 2019 altria determined that a significant increase in the number and types of legal cases pending against juul in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the expectation that this trend will continue resulted in an additional indicator of impairment 

given the existence of these impairment indicators altria performed quantitative valuations of its investment in juul as of september 30 2019 and december 31 2019 and recorded total pretax charges of 86 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 reported as impairment of juul equity securities in its consolidated statement of earnings losses of this amount altria recorded pretax charges of 45 billion in the third quarter of 2019 and 41 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 the thirdquarter impairment charge was due primarily to lower evapor sales volume assumptions in the us and international markets and a delay in achieving operating margin performance as compared to the assumptions at the time of the juul transaction the fourthquarter impairment charge results substantially from increased discount rates applied to future cash flow projections due to the significant risk created by the increase in number and types of legal cases pending against juul in the fourth quarter although altria has not made any assumptions or drawn any conclusions regarding the merits or likelihood of success of any of any of these cases litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases while juul secured approximately 720 million in financing in early february 2020 the uncertainty has 

increased the risk that juul may not be able to obtain financing andor fund working capital requirements financial obligations and international expansion plans 

altria used an income approach to estimate the fair value of its investment in juul the income approach reflects the discounting of future cash flows for the us and international markets at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing future cash flows future cash flows in the us were based on a range of scenarios that consider various potential regulatory and market outcomes 

in determining the fair value of its investment in juul altria made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were sales volume operating margins discount rates and perpetual growth rates the discount rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 135 to 165 at september 30 2019 and 195 to 230 at december 31 2019 the perpetual growth rates used in performing the valuations ranged from 05 to 00 at both september 30 2019 and december 31 2019 additionally altria made significant assumptions regarding the likelihood and extent of various potential regulatory actions and the continued adverse public perception impacting the evapor category and specifically juul as well as expectations of the future state of the evapor category all significant inputs used in the valuation are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

although altria’s discounted cash flow analyses were based on assumptions that altria’s management considered reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time that the analyses were developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows altria believes the following factors have the most potential to impact projected future cash flows and therefore altria’s valuation of juul federal state local and international regulatory developments juul’s execution of its strategy including the success of its planned international market expansions category growth rates evaporrelated litigation against juul consumer preferences and competitive activity 

while altria’s management believes that the estimated fair value of its investment in juul as of december 31 2019 is appropriate juul’s actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance due to changes in the factors noted above one or more such changes could result in additional impairment charges to altria’s investment in juul in future periods 

for additional information on altria’s investment in juul and the impairment indicators that altria considered see note 7  investments in equity securities  investment in juul  

▪ marketing costs altria’s businesses promote their products with consumer incentives trade promotions and consumer engagement programs these consumer incentive and trade promotion activities which include discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives do not create a distinct deliverable and are therefore recorded as a reduction of revenues consumer engagement program payments are made to third parties altria’s businesses expense these consumer engagement programs which include event marketing as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing administration and research costs in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings losses for interim reporting purposes altria’s businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies as discussed in note 19 and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various us and foreign jurisdictions against altria and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees and altria’s investees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due in addition pm usa middleton nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume operating income market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales altria’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 45 billion 45 billion and 47 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees 

altria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except to the extent discussed in note 19 and item 3 i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings losses 

▪ employee benefit plans altria provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees including pension postretirement health care and postemployment benefits altria records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified 

by us gaap which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets mortality compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings losses are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years 

altria’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations decreased to 34 at december 31 2019 from 44 at december 31 2018 altria presently anticipates a decrease of approximately 36 million in its 2020 pretax pension and postretirement expense versus 2019 excluding amounts in each year related to settlement and curtailment this anticipated decrease is due primarily to i lower interest costs driven by the impact of lower discount rates and ii lower amortization due to a change in the recognition period based on the culmination of pension population changes to primarily inactive status following the plan’s closure to new entrants in 2008 this decrease is partially offset by lower expected return on assets due to a change in asset allocation strategy assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve a 50 basis point decrease increase in altria’s discount rates would increase decrease altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 15 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 40 million 

for additional information see note 17  benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 17 ” 

▪ income taxes significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria records a valuation allowance when it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

altria recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings losses 

altria recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings losses during 2019  2018 and 2017 as a result of various tax events including the impact of the tax reform act 

the main provisions of the tax reform act that impact altria include i a reduction in the us federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and ii changes in the treatment of foreignsource income commonly referred to as a modified territorial tax system 

the transition to a modified territorial tax system required altria to record a deemed repatriation tax and an associated tax basis benefit in 2017 the tax impact related to the tax basis benefit and the deemed repatriation tax was based on provisional estimates as of january 2018 substantially all of which were related to altria’s share of abi’s accumulated earnings and associated taxes altria recorded adjustments to the provisional estimates and completed the accounting for the repatriation tax in 2018

operating results by business segment 

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the us tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees and altria’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail below in note 19  item 1a and item 3 include 

 in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for altria’s tobacco subsidiaries altria’s tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch among tobacco categories use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products such as evapor products and oral nicotine pouches in fact a growing number of adult smokers are converting from cigarettes to exclusive use of noncombustible tobacco product alternatives the evapor category has experienced significant growth in recent years and the number of adults who exclusively use evapor products also has increased which along with growth in oral nicotine pouches has negatively impacted consumption levels and sales volume of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco 1 continued growth in the evapor category may be negatively impacted by legislative and regulatory activities discussed below based on the accelerated adult smoker movement across categories and the federal government raising the legal age to purchase tobacco products to 21 as discussed below under federal state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products  altria expects the us adjusted cigarette industry volume for 2020 to decline by 4  6 due to the expected continued volatility across tobacco categories altria is no longer providing a multiyear forecast for us cigarette industry volume decline altria and its tobacco subsidiaries believe the innovative tobacco product categories will continue to be dynamic as adult tobacco consumers explore a variety of tobacco product options and as the regulatory environment for these innovative tobacco products evolves 

 

1 “smokeless tobacco” as used in this section of this annual report on form 10k refers to smokeless tobacco products first regulated by the fda in 2009 it excludes oral nicotine pouches which were first regulated by the fda in 2016 

altria and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the us through innovation and adjacency growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties 

fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action under the fsptca the fda has broad authority to 1 regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products 2 require disclosures of related information and 3 enforce the fsptca and related regulations the fsptca applies to cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and as of 2016 other tobacco products see fda regulatory actions  deeming regulations below 

among other measures the fsptca or its implementing regulations 

 ▪ premarket review pathways for tobacco products including substantial equivalence the fsptca permits the sale of tobacco products that were commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 and for which no modifications have been made to the products since that date “grandfathered products” for new and modified tobacco products however the fsptca imposes restrictions on marketing requiring fda review and authorization before marketing a new or modified product specifically cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market after march 22 2011 and other tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market after august 8 2016 are subject to new tobacco product application and premarket review and authorization requirements unless a manufacturer can demonstrate they are “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 the fda could deny any such new tobacco product application or determine lack of substantial equivalence thereby preventing the distribution and sale of any product affected by such denial a manufacturer is permitted however to introduce grandfathered products into the marketplace 

for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and march 22 2011 “provisional products” for which a manufacturer submitted substantial equivalence reports the fda may determine that such products are not “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 in such cases the fda could require the removal of such products from the marketplace see fda regulatory actions  substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways  cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products below 

similarly the fda could determine that other tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and august 8 2016 for which a manufacturer submits substantial equivalence reports are not “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 or reject a new tobacco product application submitted by a manufacturer both of which could require the removal of such products from the marketplace see fda’s comprehensive regulatory plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation and fda regulatory actions  substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways  other tobacco products below 

modifications to currently marketed products including modifications that result from for example changes to the quantity of tobacco products in a package a manufacturer being unable to acquire ingredients or a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency 

required in ingredients can trigger the fda’s premarket review process described above as noted adverse determinations by the fda during that process could restrict a manufacturer’s ability to continue marketing such products 

▪ fda’s comprehensive regulatory plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation in july 2017 the fda announced a comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation designed to strike a balance between regulation and encouraging the development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes since then the fda has issued additional information about its comprehensive plan in response to concerns associated with the rise in the use of evapor products by youth and the potential youth appeal of flavored tobacco products the fda said it is monitoring youth tobacco usage rates particularly evapor product use and exercised its regulatory authority by implementing measures designed to decrease youth tobacco use including the removal of certain evapor products from the market see fda regulatory actions  underage access and use of certain tobacco products below 

major components of the fda’s comprehensive plan include the following 

 see fda regulatory actions below for further discussion 

▪ rulemaking and guidance the provisions of the fsptca that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and for some issues scientific review as required by the fsptca the fda has established a tobacco product scientific advisory committee the “tpsac” which consists of voting and nonvoting members to provide advice reports information and recommendations to the fda on certain scientific and health issues relating to tobacco products tpsac votes are considered by the fda but are not binding from time to time the fda issues guidance which may be issued in draft or final form and generally involves public comment altria’s tobacco subsidiaries participate actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by us states territories and localities of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect the ability of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs and user fees regulations imposed and other regulatory actions taken by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries in a number of different ways for example actions by the fda could 

 the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions also could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

the fsptca imposes user fees on cigarette cigarette tobacco smokeless tobacco cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the fsptca does not impose user fees on evapor or oral nicotine pouch manufacturers the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares all as prescribed by the 

statute and fda regulations payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the fda user fee payments on altria see offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for altria’s tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material either individually or in the aggregate to one or more of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings monetary penalties product withdrawal and recall orders and product seizures the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca the fda repromulgated in march 2010 a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the “final tobacco marketing rule” the may 2016 amendments to the final tobacco marketing rule apply certain provisions to certain “covered tobacco products” which include cigars evapor products containing nicotine or other tobacco derivatives pipe tobacco and oral nicotine pouches but do not include any component or part that is not made or derived from tobacco the final tobacco marketing rule as so amended 

 subject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for covered tobacco products at the time of the repromulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda also issued an anprm regarding the socalled “1000 foot rule” which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds 

▪ fda regulatory actions 

 in march 2019 in a case filed by the american academy of pediatrics and other plaintiffs a federal district court in massachusetts ordered the fda to propose a new rule relating to graphic health warnings by august 2019 and to submit the final version of the rule for publication by march 2020 in may 2019 the fda appealed the district court’s order to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit currently the appeal is stayed pending the fda’s timely issuance of a final rule on graphic health warnings in august 2019 the fda proposed a new graphic warnings rule which was subject to public comment pm usa and nat sherman filed comments with the fda as of february 21 2020 the fda has not issued a final rule 

▪ substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways 



require the removal of such products from the marketplace leaving altria’s cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries with the option of marketing other products that have received fda premarket authorization or grandfathered products 

the fda has communicated that it will not review a certain subset of provisional product substantial equivalence reports and that the products that are the subject of those reports can generally continue to be legally marketed without further fda review pm usa and usstc have provisional products included in this subset of products but also have a number of provisional products that will continue to be subject to the substantial equivalence review process in addition pm usa and usstc have submitted and continue to submit substantial equivalence reports on products proposed to be marketed after march 22 2011 “nonprovisional products” 

pm usa and usstc have received substantial equivalence determinations on certain provisional and nonprovisional products the provisional products that were found to be not substantially equivalent certain smokeless tobacco products had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the fda’s determinations therefore the determinations did not impact business results 

while altria’s cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries believe all of their current products meet the statutory requirements of the fsptca they cannot predict whether when or how the fda ultimately will apply its guidance to their various respective substantial equivalence reports or seek to enforce the law and regulations should altria’s cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries receive unfavorable determinations on any substantial equivalence reports currently pending with the fda they believe they have the ability to replace most of their respective product volumes that could be impacted by these determinations with other products that have received fda premarket authorization or with grandfathered products 

 previously the deadlines to file all substantial equivalence reports and new tobacco product applications for combustible other tobacco products such as cigars and pipe tobacco and for noncombustible other tobacco products such as evapor products and oral nicotine pouches were at various points in 2018 the fda extended these deadlines to august 8 2021 for combustible other tobacco products and august 8 2022 for noncombustible other tobacco products through guidance rather than by providing notice and allowing for public comment in may 2019 in a lawsuit filed by the american academy of pediatrics among other plaintiffs a federal court in maryland found that the fda’s failure to engage in the notice and comment process violated the administrative procedures act in july 2019 the court ordered that 1 the fda require that for other tobacco products on the market as of august 8 2016 applications must be filed with the fda by may 12 2020 2 at the fda’s discretion other tobacco products for which applications are not timely filed will be subject to fda enforcement action 3 applications for other tobacco products that are timely filed can remain on the market during fda review without being subject to fda enforcement action for up to one year from the date of the application and 4 on a casebycase basis the fda can exempt other tobacco products from filing requirements for good cause the court’s ruling did not however prevent the fda from taking enforcement action against other tobacco products prior to the may 12 2020 filing deadline the fda and other parties appealed the court’s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit if juul is unable to meet the may 12 2020 filing deadline or if juul’s new tobacco product applications are timely filed but subsequently denied it could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul and have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

manufacturers of cigars and oral nicotine pouches also must file substantial equivalence reports or new tobacco product applications by the may 12 2020 filing deadline in order for their products to remain on the market middleton has received market authorizations from the fda that cover a significant portion of its cigar product volume and has filed substantial equivalence reports with the fda that cover nearly all of its remaining cigar product volume middleton continues to prepare and file substantial equivalence reports with the fda and plans to submit all required filings by the may 12 2020 filing deadline helix plans to file all required new tobacco product applications for its oral nicotine pouches by the may 12 2020 filing deadline 

failure of other tobacco product manufacturers including middleton helix and juul to meet the may 12 2020 filing deadline for currently marketed products or to ultimately obtain market authorization from the fda following proper submission could result in other tobacco products being removed from the market 

in january 2020 in an effort to address youth usage of certain other tobacco products the fda issued final guidance the “january 2020 final guidance” in which it stated that certain cartridgebased flavored evapor products other than tobacco and menthol flavors would be prioritized for fda enforcement action beginning early february 2020 effectively requiring the removal of these products from the market unless these products receive fda market authorization evapor product manufacturers may still however file new tobacco product applications for these products in its january 2020 final guidance independent of the abovementioned federal court order the fda adopted the may 12 2020 filing deadline and stated that after that deadline it would prioritize its enforcement against any evapor product in any format or flavor offered for sale but for which either no new tobacco product application has been filed or for which an application was timely filed but for which the fda issued a negative decision see fda regulation  underage access and use of certain tobacco products below for further discussion the effect of this guidance is to restrict the sale of certain flavored cartridgebased evapor products including those manufactured by juul but permit the continued sale subject to the exceptions discussed above of other flavored evapor products including flavored disposable evapor products if these other flavored evapor products are sold in higher volumes than juul’s evapor products it could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul and have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

 in september 2019 the fda issued a proposed rule in which it set forth requirements for content format and fda’s procedures for reviewing new tobacco product applications pm usa nat sherman middleton usstc and helix filed comments with the fda as of february 21 2020 no final rule has issued 

it is not possible to predict how long reviews by the fda of substantial equivalence reports or new tobacco product applications for any tobacco product will take a “not substantially equivalent” determination or denial of a new tobacco product application on one or more products could have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

 among the fsptca requirements that apply to other tobacco products is a ban on descriptors including “mild” when used as descriptors of modified risk unless expressly authorized by the fda in connection with a 2016 lawsuit initiated by middleton the department of justice on behalf of the fda informed middleton that at present the fda does not intend to bring an enforcement action against middleton for the use of the term “mild” in the trademark “black  mild” consequently middleton dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice if the fda were to change its position at some later date middleton would have the opportunity to make a submission to the fda and ultimately if necessary to bring another lawsuit 

 in march 2019 the fda issued draft guidance the “march 2019 draft guidance” further reflecting among other things its concerns about youth evapor use the fda finalized this guidance in the form of the january 2020 final guidance discussed above which revises the fda’s compliance policy and states that the fda intends to prioritize enforcement action against 



 the january 2020 final guidance became effective in early february 2020 fda enforcement action could result in tobacco products that are subject to such action being removed from the market unless and until these products receive premarket authorization from the fda juul ceased its sales of all of its cartridgebased flavored evapor products other than tobacco and menthol in 2019 if fda enforcement action is taken against currently marketed juul evapor products and a significant number of those products are removed from the market or if the fda does not ultimately allow for the reintroduction of flavors other than tobacco and menthol it could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul and have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

 this anprm process may ultimately lead to the fda’s development of product standards for nicotine in combustible tobacco products such as cigarettes and cigars if such regulations were to become final and upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

 in the march 2019 draft guidance noted above under fda regulatory action  underage access and use of certain tobacco products  the fda also announced its intention to prioritize enforcement action against flavored cigars other than tobacco flavor that either are not grandfathered products or have not received market authorization from the fda to remain on the market in the january 2020 final guidance the fda declined to take enforcement action against such cigars before the may 12 2020 filing deadline instead the fda reiterated its intention to issue a proposed rule for a product standard banning all cigars with characterizing flavors in its march 2019 draft guidance the fda indicated that such a rule would include grandfathered products and cigars that have received market authorization from the fda 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries submitted public comments in response to the anprm regarding flavors in tobacco products and to the march 2019 draft guidance any proposed rules ultimately may lead to the fda banning characterizing flavors in not only cigars but in all tobacco products including oral nicotine pouches if these regulations become final and are upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 



excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the us significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the us 

federal state and local cigarette excise taxes have increased substantially over the past two decades far outpacing the rate of inflation between the end of 1998 and february 21 2020 the weightedaverage state cigarette excise tax increased from 036 to 182 per pack as of february 21 2020 no state has increased cigarette excise taxes in 2020 but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed 

a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria’s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 21 2020 the federal government 23 states puerto rico philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the sales volume and reported share performance of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

an increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on evapor and oral nicotine pouches as of february 21 2020 21 states the district of columbia puerto rico and a number of cities and counties tax evapor products these taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the evapor product form similarly nine states and the district of columbia tax oral nicotine pouches 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 21 2020 180 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the us is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobaccorelated issues 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the us either indirectly or as a result of the us becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 19  during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation operating income market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements on altria see offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below and note 19  the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and us territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 

other international federal state and local regulation and governmental and private activity 

▪ international federal state and local regulation a number of states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products including evapor and other innovative tobacco products such as legislation that 1 prohibits the sale of tobacco product categories such as evapor andor the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors such as menthol cigarettes 2 requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings and 3 restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products including proposals to ban all tobacco product sales the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions for example a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint or wintergreenflavored products as of february 21 2020 23 states and the district of columbia have proposed legislation to ban flavors in one or more tobacco products including evapor products oral nicotine pouches and cigarettes and two states massachusetts and new jersey have passed such legislation additionally massachusetts has passed legislation capping the amount of nicotine in evapor products similar legislation has been proposed in six other states 

in addition to legislation some state governors have imposed restrictions on tobacco products through executive action for example in response to reports of lung injuries and deaths related to evapor product use the governors of eight states exercised executive action to temporarily prohibit either the sale of all evapor products or evapor products with flavors other than tobacco some of those executive actions have been challenged in the courts similar executive action andor proposed legislation is being considered in 12 additional states restrictions on evapor products also have been instituted or proposed internationally for example in september 2019 india instituted a ban on evapor products 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries have challenged and will continue to challenge certain state and local legislation and other governmental action including through litigation it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ federal state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products after a number of states and localities proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products including evapor products in december 2019 the federal government passed legislation increasing the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products including evapor products to 21 nationwide although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on sales volume of our tobacco businesses as discussed above under underage access and use of certain tobacco products altria supported raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels reflecting its longstanding commitment to combat underage tobacco use 

▪ health effects of tobacco products including evapor products reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including various reports by the us surgeon general more recently there have been public health advisories concerning vapingrelated lung injuries and deaths altria and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the us surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products 

most jurisdictions within the us have restricted smoking in public places and some have restricted vaping in public places some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking and vaping in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting children it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes require tax stamping of smokeless tobacco products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and investees and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul 

▪ governmental investigations from time to time altria its subsidiaries and investees are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters for example i the ftc issued a civil investigative demand to altria while conducting its antitrust review of altria’s investment in juul seeking information regarding among other things altria’s role in the resignation of juul’s former chief executive officer and the hiring by juul of any current or former altria director executive or employee and ii the sec has commenced an investigation relating to altria’s disclosures and controls in connection with the juul investment additionally juul is currently under investigation by various federal and state agencies including the fda and the ftc and state attorneys general such investigations vary in scope but at least some appear to include juul’s marketing practices particularly as such practices relate to youth 

private sector activity 

an increasing number of retailers including national chains have discontinued or are in the process of discontinuing the sale of evapor products reasons for the discontinuation include reported illnesses related to evapor product use and the uncertain regulatory environment it is possible that this private sector activity could adversely affect the value of altria’s investment in juul and have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

illicit trade in tobacco products 

illicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of altria its tobacco subsidiaries and investees illicit trade can take many forms including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products the sale of tobacco products in the us that are intended for sale outside the country the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another counterfeit tobacco products for example are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments counterfeit versions of our tobacco subsidiaries’ and investees’ products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands illicit trade in tobacco products also harms lawabiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees have made in legitimate distribution channels moreover illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal state and local governments losing tax revenues losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions including increasing excise taxes imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact altria’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows including adversely affecting the value of altria’s investment in juul and the businesses of its tobacco subsidiaries and investees or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries communicate with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities enforce wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and when necessary litigate to protect their trademarks 

price availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials and component parts 

shifts in crops such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns government restrictions and mandated prices economic trade sanctions import duties and tariffs geopolitical instability and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco other raw materials or component parts used to manufacture our companies’ products any significant change in the price quality or availability of tobacco other raw materials or component parts used to manufacture our products could restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our subsidiaries’ profitability and businesses 

with respect to tobacco as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies including geographies experiencing political instability and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries’ ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability 

timing of sales 

in the ordinary course of business our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events the timing of promotions customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and taxdriven price increases 

operating results 

the following table summarizes operating results for the smokeable and smokeless products segments

4 purchase obligations for inventory and production costs such as raw materials indirect materials and services contract manufacturing packaging storage and distribution are commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice usually 30 days any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 

5 other longterm liabilities primarily consist of accrued postretirement health care costs and certain accrued pension costs the amounts included in the table above for accrued pension costs consist of the actuarially determined anticipated minimum funding requirements for each year from 2020 through 2024 contributions beyond 2024 cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore are not included in the table above in addition the following longterm liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above accrued postemployment costs income taxes and tax contingencies and other accruals altria is unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items 

the state settlement agreements and related legal fee payments and payments for fda user fees as discussed below and in note 19  are excluded from the table above as the payments are subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation operating income market share and industry volume litigation escrow deposits as discussed below and in note 19  are also excluded from the table above since these deposits will be returned to pm usa should it prevail on appeal 

payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation  as discussed previously and in note 19  pm usa and nat sherman have entered into state settlement agreements with the states and territories of the united states that call for certain payments in addition pm usa middleton nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca altria’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 45 billion 45 billion and 47 billion of charges to cost of sales for each of the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees for further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the npm adjustment provision under the msa see health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes in note 19  

based on current agreements 2019 market share and estimated annual industry volume decline rates the estimated amounts that altria’s subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to state settlement agreements and fda user fees approximate 45 billion in 2020 and 44 billion each year thereafter these amounts exclude the potential impact of the npm adjustment provision applicable under the msa and the revised npm adjustment provisions applicable under the resolutions of the npm adjustment disputes 

the estimated amounts due under the state settlement agreements charged to cost of sales in each year would generally be paid in the following year the amounts charged to cost of sales for fda user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred as previously stated the payments due under the terms of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors including volume operating income inflation and certain contingent events and in general are allocated based on each manufacturer’s market share the future payment amounts discussed above are estimates and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results

dividends paid in 2019 and 2018 were approximately 61 billion and 54 billion  respectively an increase of 121  reflecting a higher dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased by altria under its share repurchase programs

based on quality price consumer and trade wine tastings competitive wine judging thirdparty acclaim and advertising substantially all of ste michelle’s sales occur in the united states through statelicensed distributors ste michelle also sells to domestic consumers through retail and ecommerce channels and exports wines to international distributors

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our results of operations our cash flows our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

we 1  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec reports to security holders press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans estimates and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this annual report on form 10k particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses below in item 7 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions 

 

1  this section uses the terms “we” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

against altria and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors shareholders and distributors 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases have ranged in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome 

in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 19  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 19 ” tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation altria and its subsidiaries may face potentially significant nonmonetary remedies which may cause reputational harm for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in detail in note 19  the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” 

altria and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain 

 

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria to do so see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k “item 3” note 19  and exhibits 991 and 992 to this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

significant federal state and local governmental actions including actions by the fda and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on us and our tobacco subsidiaries’ businesses and sales volumes 

as described in tobacco space  business environment  in item 7 our cigarette subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector actions including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold these subsidiaries responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke these actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels 

more broadly actions by the fda and other federal state or local governments or agencies including those specific actions described in tobacco space  business environment  in item 7  may impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products for example through product standards that may be proposed by the fda for nicotine and flavors limit adult tobacco consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace for example as a result of product contamination rulemaking that bans menthol a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence because the fda requires that a currentlymarketed tobacco product proceed through the premarket review process or because the fda otherwise determines that removal is necessary for the protection of public health restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse 

impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries see tobacco space  business environment  in item 7 for a more detailed discussion 

tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the federal state and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes  in item 7  

our tobacco businesses face significant competition including across categories and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria or the business of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

each of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories this competition also exists across categories as adult tobacco consumer preferences evolve significant methods of competition include product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging distribution and promotional activities a highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria see tobacco space  business environment    summary  in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences including evapor products growth of the evapor product category and other innovative tobacco products has further contributed to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and has adversely affected the growth rates of other tobacco products continued growth in these categories could have a material adverse impact on the business results of operations cash flows or financial position of pm usa and usstc 

pm usa also faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states these settlements among other factors resulted in substantial cigarette price increases these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states 

 

where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands 

altria and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of altria or the business of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 

 

see tobacco space  business environment    summary  in item 7 and the immediately preceding risk factor for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences specifically the growth of evapor and other innovative tobacco products and the effects on our tobacco operating companies 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries while our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products the failure to do so could negatively impact our companies’ ability to compete in these circumstances 

our financial services business conducted through pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation real estate and manufacturing equipment its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and 

competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries and investees may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams andor put them at a competitive disadvantage 

altria and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences examples include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful such as evapor products these efforts include arrangements with or investments in third parties such as our minority investment in juul this minority investment subjects us to noncompetition obligations restricting us from investing or engaging in the evapor business other than through juul subject to limited exceptions our tobacco subsidiaries and investees may not succeed in their efforts to introduce such new products which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams 

further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to adult consumers the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing decisions would be affected by reduced risk claims if permitted adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products 

if our tobacco subsidiaries or investees do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk but one or more of their competitors do succeed our tobacco subsidiaries or investees may be at a competitive disadvantage which could have an adverse effect on their financial performance 

significant changes in price availability or quality of tobacco other raw materials or component parts could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

any significant change in prices quality or availability of tobacco other raw materials or component parts could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  

 

price availability and quality   of tobacco other raw materials and component parts  in item 7  

because altria’s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any key suppliers of any of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries including as a result of a key supplier’s unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria’s subsidiaries or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria’s subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products which could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

in addition to a recall required by the fda as referenced above our subsidiaries could decide or other laws or regulations could require them to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering product recalls could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

the failure of altria’s information systems or service providers’ information systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its subsidiaries 

altria and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers such as cloud providers to support a variety of business processes and activities including complying with regulatory legal financial reporting and tax requirements engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations manufacturing and distributing our products collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information and communicating internally and externally with employees investors suppliers trade customers adult consumers and others we continue to make investments in 

administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyberthreats including human error and malicious acts our safeguards include employee training testing and auditing protocols backup systems and business continuity plans maintenance of security policies and procedures monitoring of networks and systems and thirdparty risk management 

to date interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations however because technology is increasingly complex and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future failure of our systems or service providers’ systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands operational disruptions legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria and its subsidiaries 

unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria and its subsidiaries 

from time to time altria and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of any such investigation and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of a future investigation 

a challenge to our tax positions could adversely affect our tax rate earnings or cash flow 

tax laws and regulations such as the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” are complex and subject to varying interpretations a successful challenge to one or more of altria’s tax positions could give rise to additional liabilities including interest and potential penalties as well as adversely affect our tax rate earnings or cash flows 

international business operations subject altria and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

while altria and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that 

 

it will always protect against improper actions by employees investees or third parties violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

altria may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria’s credit rating and altria may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction 

from time to time altria considers acquisitions or investments and may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or investment or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings as occurred following our investment in juul although we continue to maintain investment grade ratings any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or an investment 

disruption and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect altria’s access to these markets earnings and dividend rate 

access to the credit and capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in these markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability pricing credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

altria may be required to write down intangible assets including goodwill due to impairment which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes certain events can also trigger an immediate review of intangible assets if an impairment is determined to exist in either situation we will incur impairment losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in the fourth quarter of 2018 altria incurred 209 million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to altria’s decision to refocus its innovative product efforts and the impairment of the columbia crest  trademark see   note 4  goodwill and other intangible assets net  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a more detailed discussion 

competition unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment  in item 7 

altria’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in ab inbev and the dividends paid by ab inbev on shares owned by altria may be adversely affected by various factors including foreign currency exchange rates and ab inbev’s business results and stock price 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are translated into us dollars from various local currencies in addition ab inbev pays dividends in euros which we convert into us dollars during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer us dollars and 

 

the dividends that we receive from ab inbev will convert into fewer us dollars 

dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to the risks encountered by ab inbev in its business for example in october 2018 ab inbev announced a 50 rebase in the dividends it pays to its shareholders which will result in a reduction of cash dividends altria receives from ab inbev as discussed in the  discussion and analysis  critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 if the carrying value of our investment in ab inbev exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings we cannot provide any assurance that ab inbev will successfully execute its business plans and strategies earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to fluctuations in ab inbev’s stock price for example through marktomarket losses on ab inbev’s derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain share commitments 

we received a substantial portion of our consideration from the ab inbev transaction in the form of restricted shares subject to a fiveyear lockup furthermore if our percentage ownership in ab inbev were to decrease below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities suffer a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 

upon completion of the ab inbev transaction we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the ab inbev transaction subject to limited exceptions these transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in ab inbev for a fiveyear period that expires on october 10 2021 further in the event that our ownership percentage in ab inbev were to decrease below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and our use of the equity method of accounting for our investment in ab inbev could be challenged 

the tax treatment of the consideration altria received in the ab inbev transaction may be challenged and the tax treatment of the ab inbev investment may not be as favorable as altria anticipates 

while we expect the equity consideration that we received from the ab inbev transaction to qualify for taxdeferred treatment we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and if they do what the outcome of any such challenge will be in addition there is a risk that the tax treatment of our investment in ab inbev may not be as favorable as we anticipate 

antitrust clearance required for the conversion of our nonvoting juul shares into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all and the expected benefits of the juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all 

antitrust clearance required for the conversion of the nonvoting juul shares held by us into voting shares may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all and such clearance may be subject to unanticipated conditions unless and until such antitrust clearance is obtained including expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or extension thereof under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder our juul shares will not have voting rights and we will not be entitled to certain other rights including the right to appoint any directors to the juul board of directors accordingly failure to obtain antitrust clearance would adversely affect us including because it would substantially limit our rights with respect to our investment in juul and would prevent us from accounting for our investment in juul using the equity method 

in addition regardless of whether antitrust clearance is obtained the expected benefits of the juul transaction such as any equity earnings and receipt of cash dividends may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all including due to the risks encountered by juul in its business such as operational risks and regulatory risks at the international federal and state levels including actions by the fda unanticipated impacts on juul’s relationships with employees customers suppliers and other third parties potential disruptions to juul’s management or current or future plans and operations due to the juul transaction or domestic or international litigation developments investigations or otherwise   see   item 7  tobacco space  business environment for a discussion of certain fdarelated regulatory risks applicable to the evapor category failure to realize the expected benefits of our juul investment could adversely affect the value of the investment as discussed in the  discussion and analysis  critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 if a qualitative assessment of impairment of our juul investment were to indicate that its fair value is less than its carrying value the investment would be written down to its fair value which could have a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings 

our investment in juul includes noncompetition standstill and transfer restrictions that prevent us from gaining control of juul furthermore if our percentage ownership in juul were to decrease below certain levels we would lose certain of our governance consent preemptive and other rights with respect to our investment in juul and may be unable to account for the investment under the equity method 

the shares of juul we hold generally cannot be sold or otherwise transferred for a sixyear period that expires on december 20 2024 subject to limited exceptions we have also generally agreed not to compete with juul in the evapor space 

 

for at least six years which may be extended at our election in addition following receipt of antitrust clearance our designees will comprise no more than one third of the members of the juul board of directors as a result juul’s strategy and its material decisions are not controlled by us and the terms of our agreements with juul mean that we are required to bear the risks associated with our investment in juul for at least a sixyear period further in the event that our ownership percentage in juul were to decrease below certain levels due to transfers by us or otherwise or if we elect not to extend our noncompetition obligations beyond six years we would lose some or all of our board designation rights preemptive rights consent rights and other rights with respect to our investment in juul loss of these rights could adversely affect us by impairing our ability to influence juul and may prevent us from accounting for our investment under the equity method 

our proposed investment in cronos may not be completed within the anticipated timeframe or at all and the expected benefits of the cronos transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all 

on december 7 2018 we agreed to acquire common shares representing a 45 equity interest in cronos and a warrant to acquire common shares representing an additional 10 equity interest in cronos the proposed transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions including receipt of required regulatory approval which may take longer than expected we cannot provide any assurance that the proposed transaction will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the proposed transaction there can also be no assurance that if we complete the cronos transaction we will be able to realize its expected benefits including due to the risks encountered by cronos in its business such as operational risks and legal and regulatory risks at the international federal and state levels unanticipated impacts on cronos’s relationships with third parties its management or its current or future plans and operations due to the cronos transaction or domestic or international litigation developments investigations or otherwise

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8 and the discussion of cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a 

 

description of the company 

for a description of altria see item 1 business and background  in note 1 background and basis of presentation  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 1” 

altria’s reportable segments are smokeable products smokeless products and wine the financial services and the 

innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of pmcc and the relative financial contribution of altria’s innovative tobacco products businesses to altria’s consolidated results 

as discussed in note 1 on january 1 2018 altria adopted several accounting standard updates “asu” in connection with the adoption of two of these asus asu no 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230   restricted cash  and asu no 201707 compensationretirement benefits topic 715  improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  altria restated certain prior year amounts 

executive summary 

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in altria’s net earnings and diluted earnings per share “eps” attributable to altria for the year ended december 31 2018  from the year ended december 31 2017  were due primarily to the following 



see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 



 

 

partially offset by 

 for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis 

2019 forecasted results 

in january 2019 altria forecasted that its 2019 fullyear adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 4 to 7 over its 2018 fullyear adjusted diluted eps base of 399 this forecasted growth rate excludes the 2019 forecasted expense items in the second table below altria’s 2019 guidance reflects its expectation for a higher fullyear adjusted effective tax rate primarily resulting from lower dividends from ab inbev increased interest expense from the debt incurred from the cronos and juul transactions savings from the cost reduction program announced in december 2018 which altria expects to build over the course of the year to an annualized level of approximately 575 million and increased investments related to pm usa’s lead market plans for launching iqos  once authorized by the fda the guidance assumes littletono earnings or cash contributions from the cronos and juul investments altria expects the adjusted diluted eps growth to come in the last three quarters of 2019 with a midsingle digit decline in the first quarter in the first quarter of 2019 altria will have the increased interest expense without the full benefits of the cost reduction program and one fewer shipping day in the smokeable products segment altria expects its 2019 fullyear adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of approximately 235 to 245 



altria’s fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance and fullyear forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example loss on early extinguishment of debt restructuring charges asset impairment charges lossgain on ab inbevsabmiller business combination ab inbev special items certain tax items charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items and resolutions of certain nonparticipating manufacturer “npm” adjustment disputes under the 1998 master settlement agreement such dispute resolutions are referred to as “npm adjustment items” and are more fully described in  health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 19  

altria’s management cannot estimate on a forwardlooking basis the impact of certain income and expense items including those items noted in the preceding paragraph on altria’s reported diluted eps and reported effective tax rate because these items which could be significant may be infrequent are difficult to predict and may be highly variable as a result altria does not provide a corresponding united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” measure for or reconciliation to its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast 

the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast 



1  represents 004 for acquisitionrelated costs associated with the cronos and juul transactions and 004 for the cost reduction program announced in december 2018 

2  represents a partial reversal of the tax basis benefit recorded in 2017 attributable to the deemed repatriation tax related to altria’s investment in ab inbev for further discussion see note 15  

altria reports its financial results in accordance with us gaap altria’s management reviews certain financial results including diluted eps on an adjusted basis which excludes 

 

certain income and expense items including those items noted above altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria’s underlying results as they may be highly variable may be infrequent are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis altria’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with us gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include altria as well as its whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in which altria has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting equity investments in which altria does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for as an investment in an equity security all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

▪ revenue recognition   on january 1 2018 altria adopted asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  and all related asu amendments 

altria’s businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers while altria’s businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type all sales contracts are similarly structured these contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer all performance obligations are satisfied within one year therefore costs to obtain contracts are expensed as incurred and unsatisfied performance obligations are not disclosed there is no financing component because altria expects at contract inception that the period between when altria transfers product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less 

altria’s businesses define net revenues as revenues which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers net of cash discounts for prompt payment sales returns also referred to as returned goods and sales incentives altria’s businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and valueadded taxes imposed at the time of sale which do not include excise taxes on cigarettes cigars smokeless tobacco or wine billed to customers 

altria’s businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer altria’s businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer altria’s businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings altria’s businesses record an allowance for returned goods based principally on historical volume and return rates which is included in other accrued liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets altria’s businesses record sales incentives which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities as a reduction to revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers retailers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical volume utilization and redemption rates expected payments for sales incentives are included in accrued marketing liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets 

payment terms vary depending on product type altria’s businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue which is included in other accrued liabilities on altria’s consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized pm usa receives payment in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product usstc receives substantially all payments within one business day of the customer obtaining control of the product ste michelle receives substantially all payments from customers within 45 days of the customer obtaining control of the product amounts due from customers are included in receivables on altria’s consolidated balance sheets 

for further discussion see note 3  revenues from contracts with customers to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if altria determines that an impairment exists any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

substantially all of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets recorded by altria at december 31 2018  relate to the 2017 acquisition of nat sherman the 2009 acquisition of ust and the 2007 acquisition of middleton altria conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria to perform an interim review if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the fair values are determined using discounted cash flows 

goodwill by reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible assets at december 31 2018  were as follows 



during 2018 altria recorded goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of 111 million and 44 million respectively related to altria’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2018 to refocus its innovative product efforts which includes nu mark’s discontinuation of production and distribution of all   evapor products 

in addition during 2018  altria completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible 

assets upon completion of this testing altria concluded in the wine segment that the columbia crest  trademark of 54 million was fully impaired as columbia crest  has been negatively impacted by an accelerated decline in the 7 to 10 premium wine segment increased competition and reduction in trade support the results of the 2018 quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for the other reporting units and trademarks are indicated below 

at december 31 2018 the estimated fair values of the cigarettes and cigars reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets within those reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 

at december 31 2018 the estimated fair values of the smokeless products reporting unit and the indefinitelived intangible assets within the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying values with the exception of the skoal trademark at december 31 2018 the estimated fair value of the skoal  trademark exceeded its carrying value of 39 billion by approximately 20 skoal  continues to be impacted by slowing category volumes and increased competitive activities due to higher pricing and adult tobacco consumer movement among tobacco products 

at december 31 2018 the estimated fair value of the wine reporting unit did not substantially exceed its carrying value the estimated fair values of the indefinitelived intangible assets within the wine reporting unit with the exception of columbia crest  discussed above substantially exceeded their carrying values at december 31 2018 the wine reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of 15 billion by approximately 14 the wine reporting unit continues to be impacted by the slowing growth rate in the premium wine category and higher trade inventories 

during 2017  and 2016  altria’s quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets resulted in no  impairment charges 

in 2018 altria used an income approach to estimate the fair values of all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the weightedaverage discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10 

in performing the 2018 discounted cash flow analysis altria made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria’s longterm financial forecast which is used by altria’s management to evaluate business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria’s indefinitelived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2 fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and 

 

assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria’s control 

although altria’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions federal state and local regulatory developments category growth rates consumer preferences success of planned product expansions competitive activity and income and tobaccorelated taxes for further discussion of these factors see operating results by business segment  tobacco space   business environment  below 

while altria’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4  goodwill and other intangible assets net  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

altria reviews its investment in ab inbev for impairment by comparing the fair value of its investment to its carrying value if the carrying value of altria’s investment exceeds its fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary the investment is considered impaired and impairment is recognized in the period identified the factors used to make this determination include the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline ab inbev’s financial condition and nearterm prospects and altria’s intent and ability to hold its investment in ab inbev until recovery 

the fair value of altria’s equity investment in ab inbev at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 was 131 billion  and 221 billion  respectively compared with its carrying value of 177 billion  and 180 billion  respectively at december 31 2018 the fair value of altria’s equity investment in ab inbev was less than its carrying value by approximately 26 at february 22 2019 the fair value of altria’s equity investment in ab inbev was approximately 147 billion approximately 17 below its carrying value altria concluded that the decline in fair value of its investment in ab inbev below its carrying value is temporary and therefore no impairment was recorded this conclusion is based on i the fair value of altria’s equity investment in ab inbev having historically exceeded its carrying value since october 2016 when altria obtained its ownership interest in ab inbev ii the period of time that ab inbev shares have traded below altria’s carrying value began in september 2018 and the magnitude by which the carrying value of altria’s investment in ab inbev exceeds its fair value iii ab inbev’s global platform world’s largest brewer by volume and one of the world’s top five consumer products companies by revenue with strong market positions in key markets geographic diversification experienced management team financial condition expected earnings and history of performance and iv altria’s ownership of restricted shares being subject to a fiveyear lockup subject to limited exceptions ending october 10 2021 

which altria believes provides sufficient time to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value of its investment in ab inbev 

if altria were to conclude that the decline in fair value is other than temporary altria would determine and recognize in the period identified the impairment of its investment in ab inbev which could result in a material adverse effect on altria’s consolidated financial position or earnings for additional information see note 7  

altria reviews its investment in juul for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators if a qualitative assessment indicates that altria’s investment in juul is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value the investment is written down to its fair value at december 31 2018 there was no indication of impairment for additional information see note 8 

▪ marketing costs   altria’s businesses promote their products with consumer incentives trade promotions and consumer engagement programs these consumer incentive and trade promotion activities which include discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives do not create a distinct deliverable and are therefore recorded as a reduction of revenues consumer engagement program payments are made to third parties altria’s businesses expense these consumer engagement programs which include event marketing as incurred and such expenses are included in marketing administration and research costs in altria’s consolidated statements of earnings for interim reporting purposes altria’s businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies   as discussed in note 19  and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due in addition pm usa middleton nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume operating income market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement 

 

agreements and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales altria’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 45 billion 47 billion and 49 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees 

altria and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except to the extent discussed in note 19  and item 3 i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings 

▪ employee benefit plans   as discussed in note 17  benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 17” altria provides a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees including pension postretirement health care and postemployment benefits altria records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets mortality compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings losses are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years 

at december 31 2018 altria’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations increased from 37 to 44 at december 31 2018 altria presently anticipates a decrease of approximately 15 million in its 2019 pretax pension and postretirement expense versus 2018 excluding amounts in each year related to termination settlement and curtailment this anticipated decrease is due primarily to lower amortization of unrecognized losses partially offset by higher interest costs each driven by the impact of higher discount rates assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve a 50 basis point decrease in altria’s discount rates would increase altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 46 

million and a 50 basis point increase in altria’s discount rates would decrease altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 42 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 38 million see note 17  for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

▪ income taxes   significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria records a valuation allowance when it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

altria recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings 

altria recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2018  2017  and 2016  as a result of various tax events including the impact of the tax reform act 

the main provisions of the tax reform act that impact altria include i a reduction in the us federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 and ii changes in the treatment of foreignsource income commonly referred to as a modified territorial tax system 

the transition to a modified territorial tax system required altria to record a deemed repatriation tax and an associated tax basis benefit in 2017 the tax impact related to the tax basis benefit and the deemed repatriation tax was based on provisional estimates as of january 18 2018 substantially all of which were related to altria’s share of ab inbev’s accumulated earnings and associated taxes altria recorded adjustments to the provisional estimates in 2018 the accounting for the repatriation tax is complete therefore no further adjustments to the provisional estimates are required

operating results by business segment 

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the united states tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and investees and our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail in note 19  item 1a and item 3 include 



 in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for altria’s tobacco subsidiaries our tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch among tobacco categories use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products such as evapor products and oral tobaccoderived nicotine products the evapor category grew rapidly from 2012 through early 2015 off a small base but then plateaued the growth trend resumed in 2017 and accelerated rapidly in 2018 growth of the evapor category and other innovative tobacco products has negatively impacted consumption levels and sales volume of other tobacco product categories in connection with this rapid growth trend in the evapor category altria anticipates that the us cigarette industry volume decline rate may exceed the recent longterm decline rate with expected annual decline rates of 35  5 in 2019 and 4  5 in 2019 through 2023 altria and its tobacco subsidiaries believe the innovative tobacco product categories will continue to be dynamic as adult tobacco consumers explore a variety of tobacco product options and as the regulatory environment for these innovative tobacco products evolves 

altria and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the united states through innovation and adjacency growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties see the discussions regarding new product technologies adjacency growth strategy and evolving consumer preferences in item 1a for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion 

 

we have provided additional detail on the following topics below 

 fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action under the fsptca the fda has broad authority to 1 regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products 2 require disclosures of related information and 3 enforce the fsptca and related regulations the fsptca went into effect in 2009 for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for all other tobacco products including cigars evapor products pipe tobacco and oral tobaccoderived nicotine products “other tobacco products” see fda regulatory actions  deeming regulations  below 

among other measures the fsptca or its implementing regulations 



cigarettes nicotine yields and other constituents or ingredients and imposing manufacturing standards for tobacco products see fda’s comprehensive regulatory plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation and  fda regulatory actions  potential product standards below 

 ▪ premarket review pathways including substantial equivalence the fsptca imposes restrictions on marketing new and modified tobacco products requiring fda review to begin marketing a new product or continue marketing a modified product specifically cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market after march 22 2011 and other tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market after august 8 2016 are subjected to new tobacco product application and premarket review and authorization requirements unless a manufacturer can demonstrate they are “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 the fda could deny any such new tobacco product application thereby preventing the distribution and sale of any product affected by such denial 

for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and march 22 2011 “provisional products” for which a manufacturer submitted substantial equivalence reports that the fda determines are not “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 the fda could require the removal of such products from the marketplace see  fda regulatory actions   substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways below 

similarly the fda could determine that other tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and august 8 2016 for which a manufacturer submits substantial equivalence reports that the fda determines are not “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 or rejects a new tobacco product application submitted by a manufacturer both of which could require the removal of such products from the marketplace see  fda’s comprehensive regulatory plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation and  fda regulatory actions   substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways below 

modifications to currentlymarketed products including modifications that result from for example a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients or a manufacturer being unable to obtain the ingredients with the required specifications can trigger the fda’s premarket review process described above as noted adverse determinations by the fda during that process could restrict a manufacturer’s ability to continue marketing such products 

 

▪ fda’s comprehensive regulatory plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation in july 2017 the fda announced a comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation that will serve as the fda’s multiyear regulatory road map the “july 2017 comprehensive plan” the fda has stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes major components of the july 2017 comprehensive plan include the following 

 in september 2018 the fda announced that while it continues to be committed to the approach outlined in the july 2017 comprehensive plan it is taking a number of steps to address underage use of evapor products including i reexamining the fda’s compliance policy that extended the dates for manufacturers of certain evapor products to submit applications for premarket authorization and ii issuing letters to the manufacturers of certain evapor products requiring them to submit to the fda plans for addressing youth access and use of evapor products see fda regulatory actions  underage access and use of evapor products  below for steps altria has taken in response to this request from the fda   

in november 2018 the fda announced additional steps it is considering taking with respect to flavored tobacco products because of concerns that these products are appealing to youth including 

 the fda is monitoring youth tobacco usage rates particularly usage rates of evapor products and has indicated that it may exercise its regulatory authority by implementing measures designed to decrease youth tobacco use potentially including the removal of evapor products from the market 

▪ implementation timing rulemaking and guidance the implementation of the fsptca began in 2009 for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for other tobacco products and will continue over time the provisions of the fsptca that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and for some issues scientific review as required by the fsptca the fda has established a tobacco product scientific advisory committee the “tpsac” which consists of voting and nonvoting members to provide advice reports information and recommendations to the fda on scientific and health issues relating to tobacco products tpsac votes are considered by the fda but are not binding from time to time the fda issues guidance that also generally involves public comment which may be issued in draft or final form 

altria’s tobacco subsidiaries participate actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states territories and localities of the united states of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements  below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs and user fees   regulations imposed and other regulatory actions taken by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries in a number of different ways for example actions by the fda could 



 

 the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions could also have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the fsptca imposes user fees on cigarette cigarette tobacco smokeless tobacco cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the fsptca does not impose user fees on evapor product manufacturers the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares all as prescribed by the statute and fda regulations payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the fda user fee payments on altria see financial review  offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material either individually or in the aggregate to one or more of our tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings monetary penalties product withdrawal and recall orders and product seizures the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of altria or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca the fda repromulgated in march 2010 a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 but 

never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the “final tobacco marketing rule” the may 2016 amendments to the final tobacco marketing rule instituted as part of the fda’s deeming regulations apply certain provisions to certain “covered tobacco products” which include cigars evapor products containing nicotine or other tobacco derivatives pipe tobacco and oral tobaccoderived nicotine products but do not include any component or part that is not made or derived from tobacco the final tobacco marketing rule as so amended 

 subject to certain limitations arising from legal challenges the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for covered tobacco products at the time of the repromulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda also issued an anprm regarding the socalled “1000 foot rule” which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds pm usa and usstc submitted comments on this anprm 

▪ fda regulatory actions 



 

required to send to the fda a report demonstrating substantial equivalence by march 22 2011 for the fda to determine if such tobacco products are “substantially equivalent” to products commercially available as of february 15 2007 most cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently marketed by pm usa and usstc are provisional products as are some of the products currently marketed by nat sherman our subsidiaries submitted timely substantial equivalence reports for these provisional products and can continue marketing these products unless the fda makes a determination that a specific provisional product is not substantially equivalent if the fda ultimately makes such a determination it could require the removal of such products from the marketplace in april 2018 the fda announced that it will not review a certain subset of provisional product substantial equivalence reports and that those products can generally continue to be legally marketed without further fda review pm usa and usstc have provisional products included in this subset of products but also have provisional products that will continue to be subject to the substantial equivalence review process as discussed below in addition pm usa and usstc submitted substantial equivalence reports on products proposed to be marketed after march 22 2011 “nonprovisional” products while our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries believe all of their current products meet the statutory requirements of the fsptca they cannot predict whether when or how the fda ultimately will apply its guidance to their various respective substantial equivalence reports or seek to enforce the law and regulations consistent with its guidance 

pm usa and usstc have received decisions on certain provisional and nonprovisional products the provisional products that were found to be not substantially equivalent all smokeless tobacco products had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the fda’s determination therefore the determinations did not impact business results in february 2018 usstc filed a lawsuit challenging the fda’s determination that certain of its nonprovisional products are not substantially equivalent in june 2018 the fda reversed its determination and found that such products were substantially equivalent as a result usstc dismissed its lawsuit 

there remain a significant number of substantial equivalence reports for products for which the fda has not announced decisions and that do not fall within the scope of the fda’s april 2018 announcement discussed above at the request of the fda our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries have provided additional information with respect to certain of these substantial equivalence reports we cannot predict whether this additional information will be satisfactory to the fda to result in substantial equivalence determinations for the products covered by those reports it is also not possible to predict how long reviews by the fda of substantial equivalence reports or new tobacco product applications for any tobacco product will take a “not substantially equivalent” determination or denial of a new 

tobacco product application on one or more products could have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

in order to continue marketing other tobacco products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between february 15 2007 and august 8 2016 manufacturers originally were required to send to the fda a report demonstrating substantial equivalence by may 8 2018 or a new tobacco product application by november 8 2018 in august 2017 the fda extended the filing deadlines for combustible other tobacco products such as cigars and pipe tobacco to august 8 2021 and for noncombustible other tobacco products such as evapor and oral nicotine products to august 8 2022 the fda also announced that it will permit manufacturers to continue to market such other tobacco products until the fda renders a decision on the applicable substantial equivalence report or new tobacco product application however as discussed below under underage access and use of evapor products  in september 2018 the fda announced that it is reexamining these timelines for certain evapor products also as noted above under fda’s comprehensive regulatory plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation  the fda announced in november 2018 that it proposes to revisit the extended compliance date by which manufacturers of flavored cigars first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and august 8 2016 would have to submit substantial equivalence reports or new tobacco product applications for such products 

because of the limited number of evapor products on the market as of february 15 2007 evapor manufacturers may not be able to file substantial equivalence reports with the fda on their evapor products in the market as of august 8 2016 in such case the evapor manufacturer would have to file new tobacco product applications which among other things demonstrate that the marketing of the evapor products would be appropriate for the protection of the public health it is uncertain how the fda will interpret the requirements for obtaining a “new tobacco product marketing order” although as noted above the fda has indicated its intention to issue appropriate regulations to clarify the requirements 

manufacturers intending to first introduce new and modified cigarette cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products into the market after march 22 2011 or intending to first introduce new and modified other tobacco products into the market after august 8 2016 must before introducing the products into the market submit substantial equivalence reports to the fda and obtain “substantial equivalence orders” from the fda or submit new tobacco product applications to the fda and obtain “new tobacco product marketing orders” from the fda 

the fda issued guidance on the substantial equivalence process in 2015 entitled “guidance for industry demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions” “substantial equivalence guidance” the 

 

guidance provides that i certain label changes and ii changes to the quantity of tobacco products in a package would each require submission of newly required substantial equivalence reports and authorization from the fda prior to marketing tobacco products with such changes even when the tobacco product itself is not changed in a 2016 industry legal challenge the court concluded that a modification to an existing product’s label does not result in a “new tobacco product” subject to the substantial equivalence review process and upheld the substantial equivalence guidance in all other respects our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries market various products that fall within the scope of the substantial equivalence guidance 

 among the fsptca requirements that apply to other tobacco products is a ban on descriptors including “mild” when used as descriptors of modified risk unless expressly authorized by the fda in connection with a 2016 lawsuit initiated by middleton the department of justice on behalf of the fda informed middleton that at present the fda does not intend to bring an enforcement action against middleton for the use of the term “mild” in the trademark “black  mild” consequently middleton dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice if the fda were to change its mind at some later date middleton would have the opportunity to make a submission to the fda and ultimately if necessary to bring another lawsuit 



in october 2018 altria responded to the fda’s request for a written plan setting forth the actions it was taking to address underage access and met with the fda in december 2018 altria refocused its innovative product efforts which included the discontinuation of all nu mark evapor products altria’s decision was based on current and expected financial performance of its innovative products as well as regulatory restrictions limiting the ability to quickly improve such products later in december altria purchased through a wholly owned subsidiary a 35 economic interest in juul following the announcement of this investment altria requested a meeting with the fda to discuss the transaction and its ongoing support for underage tobacco prevention in february 2018 the fda sent altria a letter expressing concern about this investment given the rise in underage use of evapor products and issued a statement indicating that if the increased trend in underage use of evapor products does not reverse the fda may unilaterally take action to address the trend altria responded by reaffirming its ongoing and longstanding investment in underage tobacco prevention efforts for example altria is advocating raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels to further address underage tobacco use altria will meet with the fda to continue discussing underage evapor use 

if the fda determines that it should use its regulatory authority such as through enforcement of the premarket authorization requirements for evapor products manufacturers of such products could be required to remove the products from the market until they receive premarket authorization 

 pm usa middleton and nat sherman submitted public comments in response to the anprm regarding nicotine in cigarettes and potentially other combustible tobacco products in july 2018 this anprm process may ultimately lead to the fda’s development of product standards for nicotine in combustible tobacco

 altria’s tobacco subsidiaries submitted public comments in response to the anprm regarding flavors in tobacco products in july 2018 this anprm process may ultimately lead to the fda’s development of product standards for characterizing flavors in all tobacco products including menthol in cigarettes if such regulations were to become final and upheld in the courts it could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the july 2017 comprehensive plan also includes the fda’s intent to develop evapor product standards to protect against known public health risks such as battery issues and concerns about children’s exposure to liquid nicotine

 excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the united states 

federal state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade far outpacing the rate of inflation by way of example in 2009 the federal excise tax “fet” on cigarettes increased from 039 per pack to approximately 101 per pack in 2010 the new york state excise tax increased by 160 to 435 per pack in october 2014 philadelphia pennsylvania enacted a 200 per pack local cigarette excise tax and in november 2016 california passed a ballot measure to increase its cigarette excise tax by 200 per pack and its smokeless tobacco ad valorem excise tax from 2730 to 6508 which went into effect on april 1 2017 and july 1 2017 respectively between the end of 1998 and february 22 2019 the weightedaverage state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from 036 to 179 per pack in 2018 kentucky oklahoma and washington dc enacted cigarette excise tax increases as of february 22 2019 no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2019 but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the sales volume and reported share performance of tobacco products of altria’s tobacco subsidiaries 

a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria’s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 22 2019 the federal government 23 states puerto rico philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 22 2019 180 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the united states is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would among other things establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising marketing promotion and sponsorship initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting implement regulations imposing product testing disclosure and performance standards impose health warning requirements on packaging adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products in addition the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” was approved by the conference of parties to the fctc in november 2012 it includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture distribution and sale of tobacco products the protocol has not yet entered into force but in any event will not apply to the united states until the senate ratifies the fctc and until the president signs and the senate ratifies the protocol it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the united states either indirectly or as a result of the united states becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 19  during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation operating income market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements on altria see financial review  offbalance sheet arrangement and contractual obligations  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below and note 19  the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations 

including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 

other federal state and local regulation and activity 

▪ federal state and local regulation a number of states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products including innovative tobacco products such as evapor products such as legislation that 1 prohibits the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors including menthol cigarettes 2 requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federallymandated health warnings and 3 restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products including proposals to ban all tobacco product sales the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions for example a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint or wintergreenflavored products 

whether other states or localities will enact legislation in these areas and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted cannot be predicted altria’s tobacco subsidiaries have challenged and will continue to challenge certain state and local legislation including through litigation 

▪ state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products an increasing number of states and localities have proposed legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase tobacco products above the current federal minimum age of 18 the following states have enacted such legislation virginia 21 california 21 hawaii 21 alabama 19 alaska 19 new jersey 21 utah 19 oregon 21 maine 21 and massachusetts 21 many localities including new york city 21 and chicago 21 have taken similar actions 

 

virginia enacted legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products including evapor products to 21 in february 2019 and legislation is under consideration in various other states although an increase in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products may have a negative impact on sales volume of our tobacco businesses as discussed above under underage access and use of evapor products  altria supports raising the minimum legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 at the federal and state levels reflecting its longstanding commitment to combat underage tobacco use 

▪ health effects of tobacco product consumption and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including various reports by the us surgeon general altria and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the us surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products 

most jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting minors it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes require tax stamping of mst products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ governmental investigations from time to time altria and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters altria and its subsidiaries cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced 

illicit trade in tobacco products 

illicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of altria and its tobacco subsidiaries illicit trade can take many forms including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products the sale of tobacco products in the united states that are intended for sale outside the country the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another counterfeit tobacco products for example are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments counterfeit versions of our tobacco subsidiaries’ products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands illicit trade in tobacco products also harms lawabiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment altria’s tobacco subsidiaries have made in legitimate distribution channels moreover illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal state and local governments losing tax revenues losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions including increasing excise taxes imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact altria’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows and the businesses of its tobacco subsidiaries or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold 

altria and its tobacco subsidiaries devote resources to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products and to protect legitimate trade channels for example altria’s tobacco subsidiaries engage in a number of initiatives to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products including communication with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities enforcement of wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products and when necessary litigation to protect their trademarks 

price availability and quality of tobacco other raw materials and component parts 

shifts in crops such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns government mandated prices economic trade sanctions import duties and tariffs geopolitical instability and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco other raw materials or component parts used to manufacture our companies’ products any significant change in the price quality or availability of tobacco other raw materials or component parts used to manufacture our products could restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability and adversely affect our subsidiaries’ profitability and businesses 

 

with respect to tobacco as with other agriculture commodities the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies including geographies experiencing political instability and loss of their availability could impair our subsidiaries’ ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability 

timing of sales 

in the ordinary course of business our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events the timing of promotions customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and taxdriven price increases

the interest rate on altria’s shortterm borrowings which is variable rate debt was approximately 35 at december 31 2018 altria had no shortterm borrowings at december 31 2017 

all of altria’s longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2018  and 2017  was fixedrate debt the weightedaverage coupon interest rate on total longterm debt was approximately 46  and 49  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively

the state settlement agreements and related legal fee payments and payments for fda user fees as discussed below 

 

and in note 19  are excluded from the table above as the payments are subject to adjustment for several factors including 

inflation operating income market share and industry volume litigation escrow deposits as discussed below and in note 19  are also excluded from the table above since these deposits will be returned to pm usa should it prevail on appeal 

payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation   as discussed previously and in note 19  pm usa and nat sherman have entered into state settlement agreements with the states and territories of the united states that call for certain payments in addition pm usa middleton nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca altria’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 45 billion 47 billion and 49 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees for further discussion of the resolutions of certain disputes with states and territories related to the npm adjustment provision under the msa see health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 19  

based on current agreements 2018 market share and estimated annual industry volume decline rates the estimated amounts that altria’s subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to state settlement agreements and fda user fees approximate 47 billion in 2019 and 2020 and 46 billion each year thereafter these amounts exclude the potential impact of the npm adjustment provision applicable under the msa and the revised npm adjustment provisions applicable under the resolutions of the npm adjustment disputes 

the estimated amounts due under the state settlement agreements charged to cost of sales in each year would generally be paid in the following year the amounts charged to cost of sales for fda user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred as previously stated the payments due under the terms of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors including volume operating income inflation and certain contingent events and in general are allocated based on each manufacturer’s market share the future payment amounts discussed above are estimates and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results

09 million  restricted stock units and 02 million performance stock units to eligible employees

dividends paid in 2018  and 2017  were approximately 54 billion  and 48 billion  respectively an increase of 126  reflecting a higher dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased by altria under its share repurchase programs

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our results of operations our cash flows our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

we 1  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec reports to security 

 

1  this section uses the terms “we” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria group inc and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

holders press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans estimates and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses below in item 7 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases have ranged in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may 

 

be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria group inc or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 18  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 18 ” tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation altria group inc and its subsidiaries may face potentially significant nonmonetary remedies which may cause reputational harm for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in detail in note 18  the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” that altria group inc and pm usa began making in various media in the fourth quarter of 2017 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain 

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into 

settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see item 3  legal proceedings  of this annual report on form 10k “item 3” note 18  and exhibits 991 and 992 to this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

significant federal state and local governmental actions including actions by the fda and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on our tobacco subsidiaries’ businesses and sales volumes 

as described in tobacco space  business environment  in item 7 our cigarette subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector actions including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold these subsidiaries responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke these actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels 

actions by the fda and other federal state or local governments or agencies including those specific actions described in tobacco space  business environment  in item 7   may impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products for example through product standards limit adult tobacco consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace for example as a result of product contamination a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence or because the fda requires that a modification to a currentlymarketed tobacco product proceed through the premarket review process restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries see tobacco space  business environment  in item 7   for a more detailed discussion 

tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco 

 

subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes  in item 7  

our tobacco businesses face significant competition within their categories and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria group inc or the business of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories significant methods of competition include product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging distribution and promotional activities a highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria group inc 

pm usa also faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states these settlements among other factors have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands in the cigar category additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machinemade large cigars manufactured offshore 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 



 see tobacco space  business environment    summary  in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences including evapor products growth of this product category could contribute to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and could adversely affect the growth rates of other tobacco products 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries while our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products the failure to do so could negatively impact our companies’ ability to compete in these circumstances 

our financial services business conducted through pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation real estate and manufacturing equipment its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams andor put them at a competitive disadvantage 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences examples include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful these efforts may include arrangements with or 

 

investments in third parties our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in their efforts to introduce such new products which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams 

further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to adult consumers the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing decisions would be affected by reduced risk claims if permitted adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products 

if our tobacco subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk but one or more of their competitors do succeed our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

significant changes in tobacco leaf price availability or quality could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  price availability and quality   of agricultural products  in item 7  

because altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any key suppliers of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries including as a result of a key supplier’s unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria group inc’s subsidiaries or key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria group inc’s subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products which could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

in addition to a recall required by the fda as referenced above our subsidiaries could decide or laws or regulations could require them to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering in january 2017 usstc announced that it was voluntarily recalling certain of its smokeless tobacco products manufactured at a usstc facility due to product tampering usstc recorded a charge during the first quarter of 2017 related to this recall while this charge was not material to altria group inc’s financial statements future recalls if any could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

altria group inc may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria group inc’s credit rating and altria group inc may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives of a transaction 

from time to time altria group inc considers acquisitions and may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or the occurrence of other events could negatively impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition 

disruption and uncertainty in the debt capital markets could adversely affect altria group inc’s access to the debt capital markets earnings and dividend rate 

access to the debt capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the credit and debt capital markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability pricing credit terms or credit rating 

 

may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

altria group inc may be required to write down intangible assets including goodwill due to impairment which would reduce earnings 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes certain events can also trigger an immediate review of intangible assets if an impairment is determined to exist in either situation we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

competition unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment  in item 7 

the failure of altria group inc’s information systems or service providers’ information systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the business reputation consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems many of which are managed by thirdparty service providers such as cloud providers to support a variety of business processes and activities including complying with regulatory legal financial reporting and tax requirements engaging in marketing and ecommerce activities managing and improving the effectiveness of our operations manufacturing and distributing our products collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information and communicating internally and externally with employees investors suppliers trade customers 

adult consumers and others we continue to make investments in administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect our information systems and data from cyberthreats including human error and malicious acts our safeguards include employee training testing and auditing protocols backup systems and business continuity plans maintenance of security policies and procedures monitoring of networks and systems and thirdparty risk management 

to date interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations however because technology is increasingly complex and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent there can be no assurance that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future failure of our systems or service providers’ systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands operational disruptions legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of any such investigation and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of a future investigation 

expanding international business operations subjects altria group inc and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

while altria group inc and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees or third parties violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

altria group inc’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in ab inbev and the dividends paid by ab inbev on shares owned by altria group inc may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and other factors 

 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are translated into us dollars from various local currencies in addition ab inbev pays dividends in euros which we convert into us dollars during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer us dollars and the dividends that we receive from ab inbev will convert into fewer us dollars 

dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to the risks encountered by ab inbev in its business we cannot provide any assurance that ab inbev will successfully execute its business plans and strategies earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to fluctuations in ab inbev’s stock price for example through marktomarket losses on ab inbev’s derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain share commitments 

we received a substantial portion of our consideration from the transaction in the form of restricted shares subject to a fiveyear lockup furthermore if our percentage ownership in ab inbev were to decrease below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities suffer a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 

upon completion of the transaction we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the transaction subject to limited exceptions these transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in ab inbev for a fiveyear period that expires on october 10 2021 further in the event that our ownership percentage in ab inbev were to decrease below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and our use of the equity method of accounting for our investment in ab inbev could be challenged 

our tax treatment of the transaction consideration may be challenged and the tax treatment of ab inbev dividends may not be as favorable as altria group inc anticipates 

while we expect the equity consideration that we received from the transaction to qualify for taxdeferred treatment we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and if they do what the outcome of any such challenge will be in addition there is a risk that the tax treatment of the dividends altria group inc expects to receive from ab inbev may not be as favorable as altria group inc anticipates

executive summary 

the following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in altria group inc’s net earnings and diluted earnings per share “eps” attributable to altria group inc for the year ended december 31 2017  from the year ended december 31 2016  were due primarily to the following 



see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 



 

 for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis 

2018 forecasted results 

in february 2018 altria group inc forecasted that its 2018 fullyear adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 15 to 19 over 2017 fullyear adjusted diluted eps this forecasted growth rate excludes the income and expense items in the table below altria group inc’s 2018 guidance reflects investments in focus areas for longterm growth including innovative product development and launches regulatory science brand equity retail fixtures and future retail concepts altria group inc expects its 2018 fullyear adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of approximately 23 to 24 

altria group inc’s fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance and fullyear forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example loss on early extinguishment of debt restructuring charges gain on the transaction ab inbevsabmiller special items certain tax items charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items and resolutions of certain nonparticipating manufacturer “npm” adjustment disputes under the 1998 master settlement agreement such dispute resolutions are referred to as “npm adjustment items” and are more fully described in  health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 18  

altria group inc’s management cannot estimate on a forwardlooking basis the impact of certain income and expense items including those items noted in the preceding paragraph on altria group inc’s reported diluted eps and reported effective tax rate because these items which could be significant may be infrequent are difficult to predict and may be highly variable as a result altria group inc does not provide a corresponding united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” measure for or reconciliation to its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast 

in addition the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast 

expense income net excluded from adjusted diluted eps 



1  represents tax expense for a tax basis adjustment related to the deemed repatriation tax associated with the tax reform act as defined below for further discussion see note 14 

altria group inc reports its financial results in accordance with us gaap altria group inc’s management reviews certain financial results including diluted eps on an adjusted basis which excludes certain income and expense items including those items noted above altria group inc’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria group inc’s underlying results as they may be highly variable may be infrequent are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria group inc’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis altria group inc’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate altria group inc’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to the codm for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with us gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria group inc must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts 

 

of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria group inc’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include altria group inc as well as its whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in which altria group inc has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

▪ revenue recognition   altria group inc’s businesses recognize revenues net of sales incentives and sales returns and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized altria group inc’s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria group inc depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria group inc reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria group inc performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria group inc groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria group inc also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

substantially all of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets recorded by altria group inc at december 31 2017  relate to the acquisitions of nat sherman in 2017 green smoke in 2014 ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007 altria group inc conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group inc to perform an interim review if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value the indefinitelived intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value for substantially all goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the fair values are determined using discounted cash flows 

goodwill by reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible assets at december 31 2017  were as follows 



during 2017  2016  and 2015  altria group inc completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and no impairment charges resulted at december 31 2017 the estimated fair values of all reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets within those reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values except for the  columbia crest trademark within the wine reporting unit at december 31 2017 the fair value of the columbia crest  trademark exceeded its book value of 54 million by approximately 9 results for columbia crest  in 2017 were negatively impacted by increased competitive activity and continued trade inventory reductions 

in 2017 altria group inc used an income approach to estimate the fair values of substantially all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the weightedaverage discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 9 

in performing the 2017 discounted cash flow analysis altria group inc made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group inc’s longterm financial forecast which is used by altria group inc’s 

 

management to evaluate business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria group inc’s indefinitelived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2 fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group inc’s control 

although altria group inc’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria group inc’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions federal state and local regulatory developments category growth rates consumer preferences success of planned product expansions competitive activity and income and tobaccorelated taxes for further discussion of these factors see operating results by business segment  tobacco space   business environment  below 

while altria group inc’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets see note 3  

▪ marketing costs   altria group inc’s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs consumer incentives and trade promotions such programs include discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives event marketing and volumebased incentives consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers retailers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical volume utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies   as discussed in note 18  and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 master settlement 

agreement the “msa” with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due in addition pm usa middleton nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume operating income market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria group inc’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales altria group inc’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 47 billion 49 billion and 48 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except to the extent discussed in note 18  and item 3 i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings 

▪ employee benefit plans   as discussed in note 16  benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 16 ” altria group inc provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pension postretirement health care and postemployment benefits altria group inc records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets mortality compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria group inc reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

 

altria group inc recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings losses are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years 

at december 31 2017 altria group inc’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations decreased from 41 to 37 at december 31 2017 altria group inc presently anticipates an increase of approximately 30 million in its 2018 pretax pension and postretirement expense versus 2017 excluding amounts in each year related to termination settlement and curtailment this anticipated increase is due primarily to higher amortization of unrecognized losses driven by the impact of lower discount rates partially offset by the expected return on postretirement assets resulting from the december 2017 270 million contribution to fund certain postretirement benefits assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve a 50 basis point decrease in altria group inc’s discount rates would increase altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 53 million and a 50 basis point increase in altria group inc’s discount rates would decrease altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 49 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 38 million see note 16  for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

▪ income taxes   significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions altria group inc’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria group inc records a valuation allowance when it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

altria group inc recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria group inc recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings 

altria group inc recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2017  2016  and 2015  as a result of various tax events including the impact of the tax reform act as defined below 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” the main provisions of the tax reform act that impact altria group inc include i a reduction in the us federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 and ii changes in the treatment of foreignsource income commonly referred to as a modified territorial tax system 

the transition to a modified territorial tax system required altria group inc to record a deemed repatriation tax and an associated tax basis benefit in 2017 the tax impact related to the tax basis benefit and the deemed repatriation tax was based on provisional estimates as of january 18 2018 substantially all of which were related to altria group inc’s share of ab inbev’s accumulated earnings and associated taxes altria group inc may be required to adjust these provisional estimates based on i additional guidance related to or interpretation of the tax reform act and associated tax laws and ii additional information to be received from ab inbev including information regarding ab inbev’s accumulated earnings and associated taxes for the 2016 and 2017 tax years this additional guidance and information could result in increases or decreases to the provisional estimates which may be significant in relation to these estimates altria group inc will record any such adjustments in 2018

operating results by business segment 

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the united states tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail below in note 18  item 1a and item 3 include 



 

conditions excise taxes and price gap relationships may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to discount products or other lower priced tobacco products 

 in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries our tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products such as evapor products the evapor category grew rapidly from 2012 through early 2015 off a small base but then slowed the growth trend resumed in 2017 nu mark believes the category will continue to be dynamic as adult tobacco consumers explore a variety of tobacco product options 

altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the united states through innovation and adjacency growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties see the discussions regarding new product technologies adjacency growth strategy and evolving consumer preferences in item1a for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion 

we have provided additional detail on the following topics below 

 fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action under the fsptca the fda has broad authority to 1 regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products 2 require disclosures of related information and 3 enforce the fsptca and related regulations the fsptca went into effect in 2009 for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for 

all other tobacco products including cigars evapor products pipe tobacco and oral tobaccoderived nicotine products “other tobacco products” see fda regulatory actions  deeming regulations  below 

among other measures the fsptca or its implementing regulations 

 ▪ premarket review pathways including substantial equivalence the fsptca imposes restrictions on marketing new and modified tobacco products requiring fda review to begin marketing a new product or continue marketing a modified product specifically cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market after march 22 2011 and other tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market after august 8 2016 are subjected to new tobacco product application and premarket review and authorization requirements unless a manufacturer can demonstrate they are “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 the fda could deny any such 

 

new tobacco product application thereby preventing the distribution and sale of any product affected by such denial 

for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and march 22 2011 “provisional products” for which a manufacturer submitted substantial equivalence reports that the fda determines are not “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 the fda could require the removal of such products from the marketplace see  fda regulatory actions   substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways below 

similarly the fda could determine that other tobacco products modified or first introduced into the market between february 15 2007 and august 8 2016 for which a manufacturer submits substantial equivalence reports that the fda determines are not “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 or rejects a new tobacco product application submitted by a manufacturer both of which could require the removal of such products from the marketplace see  fda’s comprehensive regulatory plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation and  fda regulatory actions   substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways below 

modifications to currentlymarketed products including modifications that result from for example a supplier being unable to maintain the consistency required in ingredients or a manufacturer being unable to obtain the ingredients with the required specifications can trigger the fda’s premarket review process described above as noted adverse determinations by the fda during that process could restrict a manufacturer’s ability to continue marketing such products 

▪ fda’s comprehensive regulatory plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation in july 2017 the fda announced a new comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation that will serve as the fda’s multiyear regulatory road map the “july 2017 comprehensive plan” the fda has stated its belief that this approach will strike an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes major components of the july 2017 comprehensive plan include the following 

▪ the fda’s planned issuance of advance notices of proposed rulemaking “anprm” seeking comments for potential future regulations establishing product standards for i nicotine in combustible cigarettes ii flavors in tobacco products and iii evapor products see fda regulatory actions  product standards  below 

▪ the fda’s planned extension of the timelines to submit applications for other tobacco products that were on the market as of august 8 2016 which the fda extended in august 2017 see fda regulatory actions  substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways below 

▪ the fda’s reconsideration of whether its current plan which is to review all “provisional” products pending in the substantial equivalence queue is an effective use of its resources and if not whether it should continue to pursue its current approach to these reviews see fda regulatory actions  substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways below as previously noted a “provisional” product refers to cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products modified or first commercially available after february 15 2007 and before march 22 2011 and 

▪ the fda’s planned issuance of foundational regulations identifying the information the fda expects to be included in substantial equivalence reports and applications for “new tobacco products” and “modified risk tobacco products” the fda also plans to finalize guidance on how it intends to review new product applications for evapor products 

▪ implementation timing rulemaking and guidance the implementation of the fsptca began in 2009 for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for other tobacco products and will continue over time the provisions of the fsptca that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and for some issues scientific review as required by the fsptca the fda has established a tobacco product scientific advisory committee the “tpsac” which consists of voting and nonvoting members to provide advice reports information and recommendations to the fda on scientific and health issues relating to tobacco products tpsac votes are considered by the fda but are not binding from time to time the fda issues guidance that also generally involves public comment which may be issued in draft or final form 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries participate actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states territories and localities of the united states of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements  below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs and user fees regulations imposed and other regulatory actions taken by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries in a number of different ways for example actions by the fda could 



 

 the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions could also have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the fsptca imposes user fees on cigarette cigarette tobacco smokeless tobacco cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the fsptca does not impose user fees on evapor product manufacturers the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares all as prescribed by the statute and fda regulations payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the fda user fee payments on altria group inc see financial review  offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material either individually or in the aggregate to one or more of our tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings monetary penalties product withdrawal and recall orders and product seizures the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of altria group inc or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca the fda repromulgated in march 2010 a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the “final tobacco marketing rule” the may 2016 amendments to the final tobacco marketing rule instituted as part of the fda’s deeming regulations apply certain provisions to certain “covered tobacco products” which include cigars evapor products containing nicotine or other tobacco derivatives pipe tobacco and oral tobaccoderived nicotine products but do not include any component or part that is not made or derived from tobacco the final tobacco marketing rule as so amended 

 subject to the limitations described below the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for covered tobacco products at the time of the repromulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda also issued an anprm regarding the socalled “1000 foot rule” which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds pm usa and usstc submitted comments on this anprm 

since enactment in 2009 several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the fsptca the final tobacco marketing rule and the deeming regulations including their constitutionality and the scope of the fda’s authority thereunder one lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of an fda regulation that restricts tobacco manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a nontobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products the case was dismissed and the fda agreed not to enforce the current or any amended trade name rule until at least 180 days after rulemaking on the amended rule concludes   in november 2011 the fda proposed an amended rule but has not yet issued a final rule pm usa and usstc submitted comments on the proposed amended rule 

 

▪ fda regulatory actions 

 pm usa and usstc have received decisions on certain provisional and nonprovisional products some of which were found to be substantially equivalent and others were found to be not substantially equivalent the provisional products all smokeless tobacco products found to be not substantially equivalent had been discontinued for business reasons prior to the fda’s determination therefore the determinations did not impact business results in february 2018 usstc filed a lawsuit challenging the fda’s determination that certain of its nonprovisional products are not substantially equivalent there remain a significant number of substantial equivalence reports for products for 

which the fda has not announced decisions at the request of the fda our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries have provided additional information with respect to certain of these substantial equivalence reports we cannot predict whether this additional information will be satisfactory to the fda to result in substantial equivalence determinations for the products covered by those reports it is also not possible to predict how long reviews by the fda of substantial equivalence reports or new tobacco product applications for any tobacco product will take a “not substantially equivalent” determination or denial of a new tobacco product application on one or more products could have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

in order to continue marketing other tobacco products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between february 15 2007 and august 8 2016 manufacturers originally were required to send to the fda a report demonstrating substantial equivalence by may 8 2018 or a new tobacco product application by november 8 2018 in august 2017 the fda extended the filing deadlines for combustible other tobacco products such as cigars and pipe tobacco to august 8 2021 and for noncombustible other tobacco products such as evapor and oral nicotine products to august 8 2022 the fda also announced that it will permit manufacturers to continue to market such other tobacco products until the fda renders a decision on the applicable substantial equivalence report or new tobacco product application 

because of the limited number of evapor products on the market as of february 15 2007 nu mark may not be able to file substantial equivalence reports with the fda on its evapor products in the market as of august 8 2016 in such case nu mark would have to file new tobacco product applications which among other things demonstrate that the marketing of the evapor products would be appropriate for the protection of the public health it is uncertain how the fda will interpret the requirements for obtaining a “new tobacco product marketing order” although as noted above the fda has indicated its intention to issue appropriate regulations to clarify the requirements 

manufacturers intending to first introduce new and modified cigarette cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products into the market after march 22 2011 or intending to first introduce new and modified other tobacco products into the market after august 8 2016 must submit substantial equivalence reports to the fda and obtain “substantial equivalence orders” from the fda or submit new tobacco product applications to the fda and obtain “new tobacco product marketing orders” from the fda before introducing the products into the market 

in march 2015 the fda issued a document entitled “guidance for industry demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions” “substantial equivalence 

 

guidance” in that document the fda announced that i certain label changes and ii changes to the quantity of tobacco products in a package would each require submission of newly required substantial equivalence reports and authorization from the fda prior to marketing tobacco products with such changes even when the tobacco product itself is not changed our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries market various products that fall within the scope of the substantial equivalence guidance 

in september 2015 after industry objections to the substantial equivalence guidance the fda issued a second edition of the guidance the “revised se guidance” which continued to require fda preauthorization for certain label changes and for product quantity changes pm usa usstc and other tobacco product manufacturers initiated litigation challenging the revised se guidance in august 2016 the court held that a modification to an existing product’s label does not result in a “new tobacco product” and therefore such a label change does not give rise to the substantial equivalence review process however the court upheld the revised se guidance in all other respects including its treatment of product quantity changes as modifications that give rise to a new tobacco product requiring substantial equivalence review 

 among the fsptca requirements that apply to other tobacco products is a ban on descriptors including “mild” when used as descriptors of modified risk unless expressly authorized by the fda in may 2016 middleton filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the fda challenging the application of the descriptor ban on the use of the word “mild” as it relates to the “black  mild” trademark in july 2016 the department of justice on behalf of the fda informed middleton that at present the fda does not intend to bring an enforcement action against middleton for the use of the term “mild” in the trademark “black  mild” consequently middleton dismissed its 

lawsuit without prejudice if the fda were to change its mind at some later date middleton would have the opportunity to make a submission to the fda and ultimately if necessary to bring another lawsuit 

 in july 2013 the fda released its preliminary scientific evaluation on menthol which states “that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes” at the same time the fda also issued an anprm requesting comments on the fda’s preliminary scientific evaluation and information that may inform potential regulatory actions regarding menthol in cigarettes pm usa submitted comments to the fda raising a number of concerns about the preliminary scientific evidence and unintended consequences 

the july 2017 comprehensive plan contemplates the issuance of an anprm seeking comments on the role that flavors including menthol in tobacco products play in attracting youth no future action can be taken by the fda to regulate the manufacture marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes including a possible ban until the completion of a full rulemaking process 



 

 these anprm processes may ultimately lead to the fda’s development of product standards for nicotine and flavors the july 2017 comprehensive plan also includes the fda’s intent to develop evapor product standards to protect against known public health risks such as battery issues and concerns about children’s exposure to liquid nicotine 

 excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the united states 

federal state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade far outpacing the rate of inflation by way of example in 2009 the federal excise tax “fet” on cigarettes increased from 039 per pack to approximately 101 per pack in 2010 the new york state excise tax increased by 160 to 435 per pack in october 2014 philadelphia pennsylvania enacted a 200 per pack local cigarette excise tax and in november 2016 california passed a ballot measure to increase its cigarette excise tax by 200 per pack and its smokeless tobacco ad valorem excise tax from 2730 to 6508 which went into effect on april 1 2017 and july 1 2017 respectively between the end of 1998 and february 23 2018 the weightedaverage state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from 036 to 175 per pack during 

2017 rhode island delaware connecticut and puerto rico enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise taxes as of february 23 2018 no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2018 but various increases are under consideration or have been proposed 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the sales volume and reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria group inc’s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 23 2018 the federal government 23 states puerto rico philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 23 2018 180 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the united states is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would among other things establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising marketing promotion and sponsorship initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting implement regulations imposing product testing disclosure and performance standards impose health warning requirements on packaging adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products in addition the 

 

protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” was approved by the conference of parties to the fctc in november 2012 it includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture distribution and sale of tobacco products the protocol has not yet entered into force but in any event will not apply to the united states until the senate ratifies the fctc and until the president signs and the senate ratifies the protocol it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the united states either indirectly or as a result of the united states becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 18  during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation operating income market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements on altria group inc see financial review  debt and liquidity  payments under state settlement agreements and fda regulation below and note 18  the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 

other federal state and local regulation and activity 

▪ federal state and local regulation  a number of states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products including innovative tobacco products such as evapor products such as legislation that 1 prohibits the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors including menthol cigarettes 2 requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federallymandated health warnings and 3 restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products including proposals to ban all tobacco product sales the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions for example a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint or wintergreenflavored products 

whether other states or localities will enact legislation in these areas and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted cannot be predicted altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries have challenged and will continue to challenge certain state and local legislation including through litigation 

▪ state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products an increasing number of states and localities have proposed legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase tobacco products above the current federal minimum age of 18 the following states have enacted such legislation california 21 hawaii 21 alabama 19 alaska 19 new jersey 21 utah 19 oregon 21 and maine 21 various localities such as new york city 21 and chicago 21 have taken similar actions 

▪ health effects of tobacco product consumption and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including various reports by the us surgeon general altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the united states surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products 

most jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting minors it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 

 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes require tax stamping of moist smokeless tobacco “mst” products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ governmental investigations from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters altria group inc and its subsidiaries cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced 

illicit trade in tobacco products 

illicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries illicit trade can take many forms including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products the sale of tobacco products in the united states that are intended for sale outside the country the sale of untaxed tobacco products over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another counterfeit tobacco products for example are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments counterfeit versions of our tobacco subsidiaries’ products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands illicit trade in tobacco products also harms lawabiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries have made in legitimate distribution channels moreover illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal state and local governments losing tax 

revenues losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions including increasing excise taxes imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows and the businesses of its tobacco subsidiaries or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold 

altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries devote significant resources to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products and to protect legitimate trade channels for example altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries are engaged in a number of initiatives to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products including communication with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities enforcement of wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products engagement with and support of law enforcement and regulatory agencies litigation to protect their trademarks and support for a variety of federal and state legislative initiatives legislative initiatives to address illicit trade in tobacco products are designed to protect the legitimate channels of distribution impose more stringent penalties for the violation of illegal trade laws and provide additional tools for law enforcement regulatory measures and related governmental actions to prevent the illicit manufacture and trade of tobacco products continue to evolve as the nature of illicit tobacco products evolves 

price availability and quality of agricultural products 

shifts in crops such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns government mandated prices economic trade sanctions geopolitical instability and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our companies’ products as with other agriculture commodities the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply certain types of tobacco are only available in limited geographies including geographies experiencing political instability and loss of their availability could impact adult tobacco consumer product acceptability any significant change in the price quality or availability of tobacco leaf or other agricultural products used to manufacture our products could restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to continue marketing existing products or impact adult consumer product acceptability adversely affecting our subsidiaries’ profitability and businesses 

 

timing of sales 

in the ordinary course of business our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events the timing of promotions customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and taxdriven price increases 

operating results 

the following table summarizes operating results for the smokeable and smokeless products segments 

smokeable products segment 

the smokeable products segment’s operating companies income increased during 2017  due primarily to higher pricing and lower costs partially offset by lower shipment volume shipment volume and retail share were negatively impacted in 2017 by a large cigarette excise tax increase in california 

the following table summarizes the smokeable products segment shipment volume performance 



cigarettes shipment volume includes marlboro  other premium brands such as virginia slims  parliament  and benson  hedges  and discount brands which include lm and basic cigarettes volume includes units sold as well as promotional units but excludes units sold for distribution to 

puerto rico and units sold in us territories to overseas military and by philip morris duty free inc none of which individually or in the aggregate is material to the smokeable products segment 

the following table summarizes cigarettes retail share performance 

retail share results for cigarettes are based on data from irimanagement science associate inc a tracking service that uses a sample of stores and certain wholesale shipments to project market share and depict share trends this service tracks sales in the food drug mass merchandisers convenience military dollar store and club trade classes for other trade classes selling cigarettes retail share is based on shipments from wholesalers to retailers through the store tracking analytical reporting system “stars” this service is not designed to capture sales through other channels including the internet direct mail and some illicitly taxadvantaged outlets it is iri’s standard practice to periodically refresh its services which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service 

pm usa and middleton executed the following pricing and promotional allowance actions during 2017  2016  and 2015  

▪ effective september 24 2017 pm usa increased the list price on all of its cigarette brands by 010 per pack 

▪ effective may 21 2017 middleton increased various list prices across substantially all of its cigar brands resulting in a weightedaverage increase of approximately 010 per fivepack 

▪ effective march 19 2017 pm usa increased the list price on parliament  by 012 per pack in addition pm usa increased the list price on all of its other cigarette brands by 008 per pack 

▪ effective november 13 2016 pm usa reduced its wholesale promotional allowance on marlboro  by 002 per pack and lm  by 008 per pack in addition pm usa increased the list price on marlboro  by 006 per pack and on all of its other cigarette brands by 008 per pack except for  lm  which had no list price change 

▪ effective may 15 2016 pm usa increased the list price on all of its cigarette brands by 007 per pack

▪ effective may 17 2015 pm usa increased the list price on all of its cigarette brands by 007 per pack 

the following discussion compares operating results for the smokeable products segment for the year ended december 31 2017 with the year ended december 31 2016 

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers decreased 215 million 09 due primarily to lower shipment volume 1273 million partially offset by higher pricing which includes higher promotional investments 

operating companies income increased 640 million 82 due primarily to higher pricing 1023 million which includes higher promotional investments lower marketing administration and research costs 251 million which includes 2016 state excise tax ballot initiative spending and lower product liability defense costs and lower asset impairment and exit costs 120 million these factors were partially offset by lower shipment volume 691 million and higher per unit settlement charges 

marketing administration and research costs for the smokeable products segment include pm usa’s cost of administering and litigating product liability claims litigation defense costs are influenced by a number of factors including the number and types of cases filed the number of cases tried annually the results of trials and appeals the development of the law controlling relevant legal issues and litigation strategy and tactics for further discussion on these matters see note 18  and item 3 for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 product liability defense costs for pm usa were 179 million 234 million and 228 million respectively the factors that have influenced past product liability defense costs are expected to continue to influence future costs pm usa does not expect future product liability defense costs to be significantly different from product liability defense costs incurred in the last few years 

total smokeable products segment’s reported shipment volume decreased 50 the smokeable products segment’s reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume decreased 51 driven primarily by the industry’s rate of decline retail share declines and one fewer shipping day when adjusted for calendar differences the smokeable products segment’s domestic cigarettes shipment volume decreased an estimated 5 total cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 4 

shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 909  of smokeable products’ reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume for 2017 versus 908  for 2016 

the smokeable products segment’s reported cigars shipment volume increased 99  

marlboro’s retail share declined 04 share points driven primarily by competitive activity and the effect of the cigarette excise tax increase in california pm usa’s total retail share decreased 04 share points 

the following discussion compares operating results for the smokeable products segment for the year ended december 31 2016 with the year ended december 31 2015

operating companies income increased 199 million 26 due primarily to higher pricing which includes higher promotional investments lower costs due primarily to lower pension and benefit costs and lower tobacco and health litigation items 39 million these factors were partially offset by lower shipment volume 298 million higher per unit settlement charges costs in connection with the productivity initiative and facilities consolidation 134 million and npm adjustment items in 2015 97 million 

total smokeable products segment’s reported shipment volume decreased 24 the smokeable products segment’s reported and adjusted domestic cigarettes shipment volume decreased approximately 25 driven primarily by the industry’s rate of decline total cigarette industry volumes declined by an estimated 25 

shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 908  of smokeable products’ reported domestic cigarettes shipment volume for 2016 versus 912  for 2015 

middleton’s reported cigars shipment volume increased 59  driven primarily by black  mild  in the tipped cigars segment 

marlboro ’s retail share declined 01 share point in 2016 pm usa’s total retail share was unchanged in 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our results of operations our cash flows our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

we 1  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec reports to security holders press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses in item 7 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there 

 

1  this section uses the terms “we” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria group inc and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

 

could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or 

other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other 

litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria group inc or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 19   contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 19” tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation altria group inc and its subsidiaries may face potentially significant nonmonetary remedies for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in note 19  the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain 

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a 

defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k “item 3” note 19  and exhibits 991 and 992 to this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

significant federal state and local governmental actions including actions by the fda and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on our tobacco subsidiaries’ businesses and sales volumes 

as described in tobacco space  business environment  in item 7   our cigarette subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector actions including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold these subsidiaries responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke these actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels 

actions by the fda and other federal state or local governments or agencies including those specific actions described in tobacco space  business environment  in item 7   may impact the adult tobacco consumer acceptability of or access to tobacco products for example through product standards including those that our tobacco companies may be unable to achieve limit adult tobacco consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace for example as a result of product contamination or a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries see tobacco space  business environment  in item 7   for a more detailed discussion 

tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes  in item 7  

our tobacco businesses face significant competition and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria group inc or the business of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories significant methods of competition include product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging distribution and promotional activities a highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria group inc 

pm usa also faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states these settlements among other factors have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands in the cigar category additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machinemade large cigars manufactured offshore 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 

 see tobacco space  business environment    summary  in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences including evapor products growth of this product category could contribute to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and could adversely affect the growth rates of other tobacco products 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products 

our financial services business conducted through pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation real estate and manufacturing equipment its lessees are subject to significant competition and uncertain economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences examples include tobaccocontaining and nicotine 

 

containing products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful these efforts may include arrangements with or investments in third parties our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in these efforts which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams 

further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to consumers the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing decisions would be affected by such claims if permitted adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products 

if our tobacco subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk but one or more of their competitors do succeed our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

significant changes in tobacco leaf price availability or quality could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  price availability and quality   of agricultural products  in item 7  

because altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any significant suppliers of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria group inc’s subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria group inc’s subsidiaries could decide or be required to recall products which could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

in addition to a recall required by the fda as referenced above our subsidiaries could decide or laws or regulations could require them to recall products due to the failure to meet quality standards or specifications suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering in january 2017 usstc announced that it was voluntarily recalling certain of its smokeless tobacco products manufactured at a usstc facility due to product tampering usstc will record a charge during the first quarter of 2017 related to this recall while this charge is not expected to be material to altria group inc’s financial statements future recalls if any could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

altria group inc may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria group inc’s credit rating and altria group inc may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives 

from time to time altria group inc considers acquisitions and may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or the occurrence of other events could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition 

disruption and uncertainty in the debt capital markets could adversely affect altria group inc’s access to the debt capital markets earnings and dividend rate 

access to the debt capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the credit and debt capital markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability pricing credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and 

 

may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

altria group inc may be required to write down intangible assets including goodwill due to impairment which would reduce earnings 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes certain events can also trigger an immediate review of intangible assets if an impairment is determined to exist in either situation we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

competition unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment  in item 7 

the failure of altria group inc’s information systems or service providers’ information systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws reputational harm and significant costs 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries rely on information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data comply with regulatory financial reporting and tax requirements engage in marketing and ecommerce activities collect and store sensitive data and confidential information and communicate internally and externally with employees investors suppliers trade customers adult consumers and others many of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have implemented administrative technical and physical safeguards including testing and auditing protocols 

backup systems and business continuity plans intended to protect our systems and data however because the techniques used in cyberattacks and security breaches change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures to date interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations failure of our systems or service providers’ systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches by parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations 

expanding international business operations subjects altria group inc and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

while altria group inc and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees or third parties violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

altria group inc’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in ab inbev and the dividends paid by ab inbev on shares owned by altria group inc may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and other factors 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are translated into us dollars from various local currencies in addition ab inbev pays dividends in euros which we convert into us dollars during times of a strengthening us dollar 

 

against these currencies our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev will be reduced because these currencies will translate into fewer us dollars and the dividends that we receive from ab inbev will convert into fewer us dollars dividends and earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev are also subject to the risks encountered by ab inbev in its business 

ab inbev may not achieve the intended benefits of the transaction which could have a negative effect on our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev 

there can be no assurance that ab inbev will be able to successfully integrate sabmiller’s business or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the transaction any of these outcomes could result in increased costs to ab inbev and could adversely affect ab inbev’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows and altria group inc’s reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in ab inbev 

we received a substantial portion of our consideration from the transaction in the form of restricted shares subject to a fiveyear lockup furthermore if our percentage ownership in ab inbev were to be decreased below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities suffer a reduction in the number of directors that we can have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors and be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting 

upon completion of the transaction we received a substantial portion of our consideration in the form of restricted shares that cannot be sold or transferred for a period of five years following the transaction subject to limited exceptions these transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in ab inbev for a fiveyear period that expires on october 10 2021 further in the event that our ownership percentage in ab inbev were to be decreased below certain levels we may be subject to additional tax liabilities the number of directors that we have the right to have appointed to the ab inbev board of directors could be reduced from two to one or zero and our use of the equity method of accounting for investment in ab inbev could be challenged 

our tax treatment of the transaction consideration may be challenged and the tax treatment of ab inbev dividends is not expected to be as favorable as prior sabmiller dividends 

while we expect the equity consideration that we received from the transaction to qualify for taxdeferred treatment we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and if they do what the outcome of any such challenge will be we also anticipate that the tax treatment of the dividends altria group inc expects to receive from ab inbev will not be as favorable as that associated with the dividends we received from sabmiller

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8 and the discussion of cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a 

description of the company 

at december 31 2016  altria group inc’s whollyowned subsidiaries included pm usa which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states middleton which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machinemade large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a whollyowned subsidiary of pm usa and ust which through its whollyowned subsidiaries including usstc and ste michelle is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine altria group inc’s other operating companies included nu mark a whollyowned subsidiary that is engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products and pmcc a whollyowned subsidiary that maintains a portfolio of finance assets substantially all of which are leveraged leases other altria group inc whollyowned subsidiaries included altria group distribution company which provides sales distribution and consumer engagement services to certain altria group inc operating subsidiaries and altria client services llc which provides various support services in areas such as legal regulatory finance human resources and external affairs to altria group inc and its subsidiaries in addition nu mark and middleton use thirdparty contract manufacturing arrangements in the manufacture of their products altria group inc’s access to the operating cash flows of its whollyowned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries at december 31 2016  altria group inc’s principal whollyowned subsidiaries were not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests 

at september 30 2016 altria group inc had an approximate 27 ownership of sabmiller which altria group inc accounted for under the equity method of accounting on october 10 2016  legacy ab inbev completed the transaction and ab inbev became the holding company for the combined sabmiller and legacy ab inbev businesses upon completion of the transaction altria group inc had a 96  ownership of ab inbev based on ab inbev’s shares outstanding at october 10 2016 following completion of the transaction altria group inc purchased 12341937  ordinary shares of ab inbev for a total cost of approximately 16 billion  thereby increasing altria group inc’s ownership to approximately 102  at december 31 2016 altria group inc had an approximate 102  ownership of ab inbev which

executive summary 

the following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in altria group inc’s net earnings and diluted earnings per share “eps” attributable to altria group inc for the year ended december 31 2016  from the year ended december 31 2015  were due primarily to the following 



see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 



 

 partially offset by 

 for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis 

2017 forecasted results 

in february 2017 altria group inc forecasted that its 2017 fullyear adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 75 to 95 over 2016 fullyear adjusted diluted eps this forecasted growth rate excludes the income and expense items in the table below altria group inc expects that its 2017 fullyear effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 36 

altria group inc’s fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance and fullyear forecast for its effective tax rate on operations exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example loss on early extinguishment of debt restructuring charges gain on the transaction ab inbevsabmiller special items certain tax items charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items and settlements of and determinations made in connection with disputes with certain states and territories related to the nonparticipating manufacturer “npm” adjustment provision under the 1998 master settlement agreement such settlements and determinations are referred to collectively as “npm adjustment items” and are more fully described in  health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 19  

altria group inc’s management cannot estimate on a forwardlooking basis the impact of certain income and expense items including those items noted in the preceding paragraph on altria group inc’s reported diluted eps and reported effective tax rate because these items which could be significant are difficult to predict and may be highly variable as a result altria group inc does not provide a corresponding united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” measure for or reconciliation to its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its effective tax rate on operations forecast 

in addition the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast 

expense income net excluded from adjusted diluted eps 



1  represents restructuring charges in connection with the facilities consolidation announced in october 2016 for further discussion see note 5 

  altria group inc reports its financial results in accordance with us gaap altria group inc’s management reviews certain financial results including diluted eps on an adjusted basis which excludes certain income and expense items including those items noted above altria group inc’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria group inc’s underlying results as they may be highly variable are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria group inc’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis altria group inc’s effective tax rate on operations may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate altria group inc’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to the codm for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with us gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria group inc must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if 

 

actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria group inc’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include altria group inc as well as its whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in which altria group inc has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

▪ revenue recognition   altria group inc’s businesses recognize revenues net of sales incentives and sales returns and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized altria group inc’s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria group inc depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria group inc reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria group inc performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria group inc groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria group inc also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets recorded by altria group inc at december 31 2016  relate primarily to the acquisitions of green smoke in 2014 ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007 altria group inc conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group inc to perform an interim review if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets by reporting unit at december 31 2016  were as follows 



during 2016  2015  and 2014  altria group inc completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and no impairment charges resulted at december 31 2016 the estimated fair values of all reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded their carrying values 

in 2016 altria group inc used an income approach to estimate the fair values of substantially all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the discount rate used in performing substantially all of the valuations was 85 

in performing the 2016 discounted cash flow analysis altria group inc made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group inc’s longterm financial forecast which is used by altria group inc’s management to evaluate business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria group inc’s indefinitelived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2 fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which 

 

relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group inc’s control 

although altria group inc’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria group inc’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions federal state and local regulatory developments category growth rates consumer preferences success of planned product expansions competitive activity and income and tobaccorelated taxes for further discussion of these factors see operating results by business segment  tobacco space   business environment  below 

while altria group inc’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4  

▪ marketing costs   altria group inc’s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs consumer incentives and trade promotions such programs include discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives event marketing and volumebased incentives consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers retailers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical volume utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies   as discussed in note 19  and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the 

year preceding that in which the payment is due pm usa usstc and middleton were also subject to payment obligations imposed by the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” the fetra payment obligations expired after the third quarter of 2014 in addition in june 2009 pm usa and usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume operating income market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria group inc’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the state settlement agreements fetra which expired after the third quarter of 2014 and fda user fees was approximately 49 billion 48 billion and 49 billion respectively 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except to the extent discussed in note 19  and item 3 i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings 

▪ employee benefit plans   as discussed in note 17  benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 17 ” altria group inc provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pension postretirement health care and postemployment benefits altria group inc records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets mortality compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria group inc reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria group inc recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as 

 

components of other comprehensive earnings losses are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years 

at december 31 2016 altria group inc’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations decreased to 41 from 44 at december 31 2015 altria group inc presently anticipates its 2017 pretax pension and postretirement expense will be essentially unchanged versus 2016 excluding amounts in each year related to termination settlement and curtailment higher expected return on plan assets due to the impact of voluntary pension contributions totaling 500 million in september 2016 is expected to be offset by the impact of higher amortization of unrecognized losses which includes the impact of the lower discount rate assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve a 50 basis point decrease in altria group inc’s discount rates would increase altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 49 million and a 50 basis point increase in altria group inc’s discount rates would decrease altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 45 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria group inc’s pension expense by approximately 38 million see note 17  for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

▪ income taxes   significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions altria group inc’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria group inc records a valuation allowance when it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized altria group inc may be required to change the valuation allowance with respect to foreign tax credit carryforwards based upon additional information to be received from ab inbev in 2017 

altria group inc recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria group inc recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings 

altria group inc recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2016  2015  and 2014  as a result of various tax events 

for additional information on income taxes see note 15 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 15” 

▪ leasing   substantially all of pmcc’s net revenues in 2016  related to income on leveraged leases and related gains on asset sales income attributable to leveraged leases is initially 

recorded as unearned income which is included in the line item finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets and subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant aftertax rates of return on the positive net investment balances pmcc lessees are affected by bankruptcy filings credit rating changes and financial market conditions 

pmcc’s investment in leases is included in the line item finance assets net on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2016  and 2015  at december 31 2016  pmcc’s net finance receivables of approximately 11 billion which are included in finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheet consisted of rents receivable 16 billion and the residual value of assets under lease 05 billion reduced by thirdparty nonrecourse debt 08 billion and unearned income 02 billion the repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to the general assets of pmcc as required by us gaap the thirdparty nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rents receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets finance assets net of 10 billion at december 31 2016  also included an allowance for losses 

estimated residual values represent pmcc’s estimate at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the noncancelable lease terms the estimated residual values are reviewed at least annually by pmcc’s management which includes analysis of a number of factors including activity in the relevant industry if necessary revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values in 2016 2015 and 2014 pmcc’s review of estimated residual values resulted in a decrease of 28 million 65 million and 63 million respectively to unguaranteed residual values these decreases in unguaranteed residual values resulted in a reduction to pmcc’s net revenues of 18 million 41 million and 26 million  in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

pmcc considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date pmcc stops recording income “nonaccrual status” on rents receivable when contractual payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain payments received on rents receivable that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance writeoffs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible there were no rents receivable on nonaccrual status at december 31 2016  

to the extent that rents receivable due to pmcc may be uncollectible pmcc records an allowance for losses against its finance assets losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable pmcc regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment impairment takes into consideration both 

 

the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur pmcc considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses for further discussion see note 8

the following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2016  with the year ended december 31 2015  

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers increased 310 million 12 due primarily to higher net revenues in the smokeless products smokeable products and wine segments 

cost of sales was essentially unchanged as higher per unit settlement charges and npm adjustment items in 2015 were offset by lower shipment volume and lower pension and benefit costs in the smokeable products segment 

excise taxes on products decreased 173 million 26 due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume 

marketing administration and research costs decreased 58 million 21 due primarily to lower costs in the smokeable products segment which included lower tobacco and health litigation items partially offset by higher costs in the smokeless products segment

operating results by business segment 

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the united states tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail below in note 19  item 1a and item 3 include 



 

competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation 

 in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries our tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products such as evapor products while the evapor category grew rapidly from 2012 through early 2015 the category has slowed since that time nu mark believes the category will continue to be dynamic as adult tobacco consumers explore a variety of tobacco product options 

altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the united states through innovation and adjacency growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties for example nu mark entered the evapor category in 2013 see the discussions regarding new product technologies adjacency growth strategy and evolving consumer preferences in cautionary factors that may affect future results  below for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion 

we have provided additional detail on the following topics below 

 fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework   the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action under the fsptca the fda has broad authority to 1 regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products 2 require disclosures of related information and 3 enforce the fsptca and related regulations the fsptca went into effect in 2009 for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for other tobacco products see fda regulatory actions  deeming regulations  below 

among other measures the fsptca or its implementing regulations 



 

february 8 2018 are not “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 or to reject a new tobacco product application submitted by a manufacturer by august 8 2018 both of which could require the removal of such products from the marketplace see  fda regulatory actions   substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways below and 

 ▪ implementation timing rulemaking and guidance the implementation of the fsptca began in 2009 for cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for other tobacco products and will continue over time the provisions of the fsptca that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and for some issues scientific review from time to time the fda issues guidance that also generally involves public comment which may be issued in draft or final form 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries participate actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states territories and localities of the united states of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements  below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs and user fees regulations imposed and other regulatory actions taken by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries in a number of different ways for example actions by the fda could 



 the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions could also have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the fsptca imposes user fees on cigarette cigarette tobacco smokeless tobacco cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the fsptca does not impose user fees on evapor product manufacturers the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares all as prescribed by the statute and fda regulations payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the fda user fee payments on altria group inc see financial review  offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement agreements fetra and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date period but could become material either individually or in the aggregate to one or more of our tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings monetary penalties product withdrawal and recall orders and product seizures the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of altria group inc or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ tpsac 



 

including the federal advisory committee act because four of the voting members of the tpsac have financial and other conflicts including service as paid experts for plaintiffs in tobacco litigation in july 2014 the district court granted plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion in part and denied defendants’ summary judgment motion ordering the fda to reconstitute the tpsac and barring defendants from relying on the tpsac report on menthol discussed below the fda appealed to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in september 2014 in january 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the trial court’s ruling on procedural grounds finding that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring suit in february 2016 plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing which was denied in may 2016 

 in march 2011 pm usa submitted a report to the fda outlining its position that neither science nor other evidence demonstrates that regulatory actions or restrictions related to the use of menthol cigarettes are warranted the report noted pm usa’s belief that significant restrictions on the use of menthol cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society the fda has stated that the tpsac report is only a recommendation and in july 2013 the fda released its preliminary scientific evaluation on menthol which states “that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes” at the same time the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comments on the fda’s preliminary scientific evaluation and information that may inform potential regulatory actions regarding menthol in cigarettes or other tobacco products in november 2013 pm usa submitted comments to the fda raising a number of concerns with the preliminary scientific evidence and about unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society no future action can be taken by the fda to regulate the manufacture marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes including a possible ban until the completion of the rulemaking process 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca the fda repromulgated in march 2010 a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the “final tobacco marketing rule” the may 2016 amendments to the final tobacco marketing rule 

instituted as part of the fda’s deeming regulations apply certain provisions to certain “covered tobacco products” which include cigars evapor products containing nicotine or other tobacco derivatives pipe tobacco and oral tobaccoderived nicotine products but do not include any component or part that is not made or derived from tobacco the final tobacco marketing rule as so amended 

 subject to the limitations described below the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and in august 2016 for covered tobacco products at the time of the repromulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the socalled “1000 foot rule” which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds pm usa and usstc submitted comments on this advance notice 

since enactment in 2009 several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the fsptca the final tobacco marketing rule and the deeming regulations including their constitutionality and the scope of the fda’s authority thereunder as a result of one such challenge  commonwealth brands  the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising is unenforceable by the fda for a further discussion of the final tobacco marketing rule and the status of graphic warnings for cigarette packages and advertising see fda regulatory actions  graphic warnings  below 

in a separate lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of an fda regulation that restricts tobacco manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a nontobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products the case was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation by which the fda agreed not to enforce the current or any amended trade name rule against plaintiffs until at least 180 days after rulemaking on the amended 

 

rule concludes   this relief only applies to plaintiffs in the case however in may 2010 the fda issued guidance on the use of nontobacco trade and brand names applicable to all cigarette and smokeless tobacco product manufacturers this guidance indicated the fda’s intention not to commence enforcement actions under the regulation while it considers how to address the concerns raised by various manufacturers in november 2011 the fda proposed an amended rule but has not yet issued a final rule pm usa and usstc submitted comments on the proposed amended rule 

▪ fda regulatory actions 



respective substantial equivalence reports or seek to enforce the law and regulations consistent with its guidance 

the fda began announcing its decisions on substantial equivalence reports for provisional cigarette cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products in 2013 there are a significant number of substantial equivalence reports for such products for which the fda has not announced decisions including reports submitted by our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries at the request of the fda our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries have provided additional information with respect to certain substantial equivalence reports at this time it is not possible to predict how long reviews by the fda of substantial equivalence reports or new tobacco product applications for any tobacco product will take a “not substantially equivalent” determination or denial of a new tobacco product application on one or more products could have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

in order to continue marketing other tobacco products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between february 15 2007 and august 8 2016 manufacturers are required to send to the fda a report demonstrating substantial equivalence by february 8 2018 or a new tobacco product application by august 8 2018 if a manufacturer does not obtain a “substantial equivalence order” from the fda by february 8 2019 or a “new tobacco product marketing order” from the fda by august 8 2019 the fda could require the manufacturer to remove such product from the marketplace 

because of the limited number of evapor products on the market as of february 14 2007 nu mark may not be able to file substantial equivalence reports with the fda on its evapor products in the market as of august 8 2016 in such case nu mark would have to file new tobacco product applications which among other things demonstrate that the marketing of the evapor products would be appropriate for the protection of the public health it is uncertain how the fda will interpret the requirements for obtaining a “new tobacco product marketing order” 

manufacturers intending to first introduce new and certain modified cigarette cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products into the market after march 22 2011 or intending to first introduce new and certain modified other tobacco products into the market after august 8 2016 must submit a substantial equivalence report to the fda and obtain a “substantial equivalence order” from the fda or submit a new tobacco product application to the fda and obtain a “new tobacco product marketing order” from the fda before introducing the products into the market 

in march 2015 the fda issued a document entitled “guidance for industry demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions” “substantial equivalence guidance” in that document the fda announced that i 

 

certain label changes and ii changes to the quantity of tobacco products in a package would each require submission of newly required substantial equivalence reports and authorization from the fda prior to marketing tobacco products with such changes even when the tobacco product itself is not changed our cigarette and smokeless tobacco subsidiaries market various products that fall within the scope of the substantial equivalence guidance 

in april 2015 pm usa usstc and other tobacco product manufacturers filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the fda the united states department of health and human services and the heads of both agencies seeking to declare these new requirements invalid and to enjoin defendants from enforcing them in may 2015 the fda announced that it was continuing to consider the substantial equivalence guidance in light of comments received and that it would not enforce the requirements under such guidance until further notice in light of the fda’s announcement the plaintiffs dismissed the pending lawsuit without prejudice in june 2015 

in september 2015 the fda issued a second edition of the substantial equivalence guidance the “revised se guidance” which continued to require fda preauthorization for certain label changes and for product quantity changes pm usa usstc and other tobacco product manufacturers filed a new lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the same defendants named in the prior suit seeking to declare the requirements of the revised se guidance invalid and to enjoin defendants from enforcing them in october 2015 plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment defendants opposed the motion for summary judgment and moved to dismiss the complaint in december 2015 in august 2016 the court held that a modification to an existing product’s label does not result in a “new tobacco product” and therefore such a label change does not give rise to the substantial equivalence review process accordingly the court vacated the revised se guidance insofar as it pertains to label changes but upheld the guidance in all other respects including its treatment of product quantity changes as modifications that give rise to a new tobacco product requiring substantial equivalence review the parties did not appeal this decision concluding the litigation 



demonstrate substantial equivalence to a product on the market as of february 15 2007 or obtain a “new tobacco marketing order” by certain specified dates to continue marketing those products for further details see fsptca and fda regulation  fda regulatory actions  substantial equivalence and other new product processespathways above  

among the fsptca requirements that apply to other tobacco products is a ban on descriptors including “mild” when used as descriptors of modified risk unless expressly authorized by the fda in may 2016 middleton filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the fda challenging the application of the descriptor ban on the use of the word “mild” as it relates to the “black  mild” trademark in july 2016 the department of justice on behalf of the fda informed middleton that at present the fda does not intend to bring an enforcement action against middleton for the use of the term “mild” in the trademark “black  mild” consequently middleton dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice if the fda were to change its mind at some later date middleton would have the opportunity to make a submission to the fda and ultimately if necessary to bring another lawsuit 

 excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the united states 

federal state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade far outpacing the rate of inflation by way of example in 2009 the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased from 039 per pack to approximately 101 

 

per pack in 2010 the new york state excise tax increased by 160 to 435 per pack and in october 2014 philadelphia pennsylvania enacted a 200 per pack local cigarette excise tax between the end of 1998 and february 23 2017 the weightedaverage state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from 036 to 161 per pack during 2016 pennsylvania louisiana and west virginia enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise taxes and california passed a ballot measure to increase its cigarette excise tax by 200 per pack and impose corresponding increases on other tobacco products and evapor products as of february 23 2017 no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2017 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the sales volume and reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria group inc’s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 23 2017 the federal government 23 states puerto rico philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 23 2017 179 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the united states is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would among other things establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising marketing promotion and sponsorship initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting implement regulations imposing product testing disclosure and performance standards impose health warning requirements on packaging adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco 

products including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products in addition the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” was approved by the conference of parties to the fctc in november 2012 it includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture distribution and sale of tobacco products the protocol has not yet entered into force but in any event will not apply to the united states until the senate ratifies the fctc and until the president signs and the senate ratifies the protocol it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the united states either indirectly or as a result of the united states becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 19  during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation operating income market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements on altria group inc see financial review  offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement agreements fetra and fda regulation below and note 19  the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases

▪ federal state and local regulation a number of states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products including innovative tobacco products such as evapor products such as legislation that 1 prohibits the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors 2 requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federallymandated health warnings and 3 restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products including proposals to ban all tobacco product sales the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions for example a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint or wintergreenflavored products 

whether other states or localities will enact legislation in these areas and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted cannot be predicted altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries have challenged and will continue to challenge certain state and local legislation including through litigation 

▪ state and local legislation to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products an increasing number of states and localities have proposed legislation to increase the minimum age to purchase tobacco products above the current federal minimum age of 18 the following states have enacted such legislation california 21 hawaii 21 alabama 19 alaska 19 new jersey 19 and utah 19 various localities such as new york city 21 and chicago 21 have taken similar actions

most jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting minors it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes require tax stamping of mst products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that could have a material adverse impact on the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our results of operations our cash flows our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

we 1  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec reports to security holders press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be  

1  this section uses the terms “we” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria group inc and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k “item 7” you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria group inc 

 

or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 47 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 18 contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 18” tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation pm usa faces potentially significant nonmonetary remedies for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in note 18 the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain 

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k “item 3” note 18 and exhibits 991 and 992 to this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

significant federal state and local governmental actions including actions by the fda and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on our tobacco subsidiaries’ businesses 

as described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7   pm usa faces significant governmental and private sector actions including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of 

tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold pm usa responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke these actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels 

actions by the fda and other federal state or local governments or agencies including those specific actions described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7 may impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products limit adult tobacco consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products or products with claims of reduced risk require the recall or other removal of tobacco products from the marketplace for example as a result of product contamination or a determination by the fda that one or more tobacco products do not satisfy the statutory requirements for substantial equivalence restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries see tobacco space  business environment in item 7 for a more detailed discussion of these risks 

tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes  in item 7  

our tobacco businesses face significant competition and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria group inc or the business of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories significant methods of 

 

competition include product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging distribution and promotional activities a highly competitive environment could negatively impact the profitability market share and shipment volume of our tobacco subsidiaries which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of altria group inc 

pm usa also faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states these settlements among other factors have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands in the cigar category additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machinemade large cigars manufactured offshore 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 

 see tobacco space  business environment    summary  in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences including increased consumer awareness of and expenditures on evapor products continued growth of this product category could further contribute to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume 

and could adversely affect the growth rates of other tobacco products 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products 

our financial services business conducted through pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into adjacent products or processes including innovative tobacco products some innovative tobacco products may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences examples include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful these efforts may include arrangements with or investments in third parties our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in these efforts which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams 

further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to consumers the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing decisions would be affected by such claims if permitted adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products 

if our tobacco subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk but one or more of their competitors 

 

do succeed our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

significant changes in tobacco leaf price availability or quality could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  price availability and quality    of agricultural products  in item 7  

because altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any significant suppliers of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria group inc’s subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria group inc may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria group inc’s credit rating and altria group inc may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives 

altria group inc from time to time considers acquisitions and may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or the occurrence of other events could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings any such change in ratings or outlook may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

disruption and uncertainty in the debt capital markets could adversely affect altria group inc’s access to the debt capital markets earnings and dividend rate 

access to the debt capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the credit and debt capital markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability pricing credit terms or credit rating may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

altria group inc’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in sabmiller may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and other factors 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller are translated into us dollars from various local currencies during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer us dollars the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller are also subject to the risks encountered by sabmiller in its business 

altria group inc may be required to write down intangible assets including goodwill due to impairment which would reduce earnings 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

competition unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop 

 

conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment  in item 7 

the failure of altria group inc’s information systems or service providers’ information systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws reputational harm and significant costs 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries rely on information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data comply with regulatory financial reporting and tax requirements engage in marketing and ecommerce activities collect and store sensitive data and confidential information and communicate internally and externally with employees investors suppliers trade customers adult consumers and others many of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have implemented administrative technical and physical safeguards including testing and auditing protocols backup systems and business continuity plans intended to protect our systems and data however because the techniques used in cyberattacks and security breaches change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures to date interruptions of our information systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations failure of our systems or service providers’ systems to function as intended or cyberattacks or security breaches by parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets personal data intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data violation of applicable privacy and data security laws damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations and it is possible that our 

business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations 

expanding international business operations subjects altria group inc and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

while altria group inc and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees or third parties violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

ab inbev’s proposed transaction to effect a business combination with sabmiller may not be completed within the anticipated time frame or at all which could have a negative effect on the value of our equity investment in sabmiller 

as described in more detail in note 6 investment in sabmiller to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 6” on november 11 2015 ab inbev announced its firm offer to effect a business combination with sabmiller the proposed transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions including shareholder approvals of both sabmiller and ab inbev and receipt of the required regulatory approvals these conditions may not be satisfied or may take longer than expected to be satisfied the transaction is also subject to other risks and uncertainties over which altria group inc has no control we cannot provide any assurance that the proposed transaction will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of the proposed transaction if the transaction is not completed or is subject to a delay the value of our investment in sabmiller could be adversely affected 

if ab inbev’s proposed transaction to effect a business combination with sabmiller is completed ab inbev may not achieve the intended benefits of the transaction which could have a negative effect on our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in the combined company 

there can be no assurance that ab inbev will be able to successfully integrate sabmiller’s business or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the proposed transaction any of these outcomes could result in increased costs to the combined company and dilution to its shareholders and could adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition and altria group inc’s reported earnings from and carrying value of our investment in the combined company 

 

if ab inbev’s proposed transaction to effect a business combination with sabmiller is completed we will receive a substantial portion of our transaction consideration in the form of restricted shares furthermore the number of restricted shares we expect to receive is under certain circumstances described below subject to proration which if it were to occur would decrease the number of restricted shares and increase the amount of cash that we receive in connection with the transaction any cash we receive will be subject to taxation and to risks associated with changes in the value of the us dollar versus the british pound 

altria group inc has committed to elect the partial share alternative “psa” in the transaction therefore upon completion of the proposed transaction we expect to receive a substantial portion of our transaction consideration in the form of shares that will be subject to certain limitations and restrictions including a fiveyear restriction on sale or transfer subject to limited exceptions these transfer restrictions will require us to bear the risks associated with our investment in the combined company for a fiveyear period following completion of the proposed transaction further while we have committed to elect the psa in the transaction our election is subject to proration to the extent that other sabmiller shareholders also elect this alternative and these elections exceed the maximum number of shares that ab inbev’s firm offer makes available to those sabmiller shareholders that elect the psa if we receive more cash and less equity consideration than we currently expect we will be subject to additional tax liabilities our percentage ownership of the combined company will be reduced and we may be unable to account for our investment under the equity method of accounting as we currently do for our investment in sabmiller 

in addition the cash consideration we expect to receive will be denominated in british pounds based on the british pound to us dollar exchange rate on november 10 2015 the trading day prior to the announcement of the proposed transaction we anticipate receiving approximately 25 billion in pretax cash we entered into a derivative financial instrument in the form of a put option to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of our counterparty financial institution to perform under the contractual obligation of the derivative financial instrument in addition as indicated above we may receive more cash consideration than we anticipate because our election of the psa is subject to proration and therefore we may not be successful in effectively mitigating our foreign currency exchange rate risk on any additional cash proceeds above the 25 billion in pretax cash that we may receive as a result of either of the above risks altria group inc could incur a decrease in the amount of the gain recorded upon the completion of the ab inbev and sabmiller transaction 

if ab inbev’s proposed transaction to effect a business combination with sabmiller is completed our tax treatment of the transaction may be challenged 

while we expect the equity consideration that we receive in the transaction to qualify for taxdeferred treatment we cannot provide any assurance that federal and state tax authorities will not challenge the expected tax treatment and if they do what the outcome of any such challenge will be it is also possible that the tax treatment of the dividends altria group inc expects to receive from the combined company may not be as favorable as that applied to the dividends we receive from sabmiller

altria group inc reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” altria group inc’s management reviews certain financial results including diluted eps on an adjusted basis which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example loss on early extinguishment of debt restructuring charges sabmiller special items certain tax items charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items and settlements of and determinations made in connection with disputes with certain states and territories related to the npm adjustment provision under the msa such settlements and determinations are referred to collectively as “npm adjustment items” and are more fully described in  health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 18  altria group inc’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria group inc’s sustainable results as they may be highly variable are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria group inc’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis altria 

 

group inc’s effective tax rate on operations may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate altria group inc’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria group inc’s chief operating decision maker for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with us gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap 

altria group inc’s fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance and fullyear forecast for its effective tax rate on operations exclude the impact of certain income and expense items including those items noted in the preceding paragraph altria group inc’s management cannot estimate on a forwardlooking basis the impact of these items on altria group inc’s reported diluted eps and reported effective tax rate because these items which could be significant are difficult to predict and may be highly variable as a result altria group inc does not provide a corresponding us gaap measure for or reconciliation to its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its forecast for its effective tax rate on operations 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria group inc must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria group inc’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include altria group inc as well as its whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in which altria group inc has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

▪ revenue recognition   altria group inc’s businesses recognize revenues net of sales incentives and sales returns and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized altria group inc’s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria group inc depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria group inc reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria group inc performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria group inc groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria group inc also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets recorded by altria group inc at december 31 2015  relate primarily to the acquisitions of green smoke in 2014 ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007 altria group inc conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group inc to perform an interim review if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value 

 

which is determined using discounted cash flows the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets by reporting unit at december 31 2015  were as follows 



during 2015  2014  and 2013  altria group inc completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and no impairment charges resulted 

at december 31 2015 

 at december 31 2015 the estimated fair value of the skoal  trademark exceeded its carrying value of 39 billion by approximately 15 and the estimated fair value of certain other smokeless products trademarks primarily red seal  and husky  exceeded their collective carrying value of 921 million by approximately 10 the 2015 results for skoal  continue to be impacted by a lower category growth rate and increased competitive activity usstc continues to implement strategies to enhance skoal ’s equity and to invest more efficiently in the brand usstc expects these strategies to improve skoal ’s profitability over the long term red seal  and husky continue to be impacted by lower levels of promotional support on these brands increased competitive activity in the discount category and sustained growth in popular priced products 

in 2015 altria group inc used an income approach to estimate the fair values of substantially all of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10 

in performing the 2015 discounted cash flow analysis altria group inc made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume 

income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group inc’s longterm financial forecast which is used by altria group inc’s management to evaluate business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria group inc’s indefinitelived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2 fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group inc’s control 

although altria group inc’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant 

judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria group inc’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions federal state and local regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences success of planned product expansions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes for further discussion of these factors see operating results by business segment  tobacco space   business environment  below 

while altria group inc’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4  

▪ marketing costs   altria group inc’s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs consumer incentives and trade promotions such programs include discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives event marketing and volumebased incentives consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers retailers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical volume utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies   as discussed in note 18  and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm 

 

usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due pm usa usstc and middleton were also subject to payment obligations imposed by fetra the fetra payment obligations expired after the third quarter of 2014 in addition in june 2009 pm usa and usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume operating income market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria group inc’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales as a result of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees altria group inc’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 48 billion 49 billion and 44 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the 2015 2014 and 2013 amounts included reductions to cost of sales of 97 million 43 million and 664 million respectively related to the npm adjustment items discussed further below and in health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 18  in addition the 2015 and 2014 amounts reflected decreases in the charge to cost of sales of approximately 300 million and 100 million respectively for the expiration of the obligations imposed by fetra after the third quarter of 2014 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except to the extent discussed in note 18  and item 3 i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings 

▪ employee benefit plans   as discussed in note 16  benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 

16 ” altria group inc provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pension postretirement health care and postemployment benefits altria group inc records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets mortality compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria group inc reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria group inc recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings losses are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years 

at december 31 2015  altria group inc changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for altria group inc’s pension and postretirement plans in 2015 and prior years altria group inc estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension and postretirement plans benefit obligations beginning in 2016 altria group inc will use a spot rate approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows as altria group inc believes that this approach provides a more precise estimate of service and interest costs altria group inc is accounting for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate this change will not affect the measurement of altria group inc’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations as the change in the service and interest costs will be offset by a corresponding change in actuarial gainslosses 

at december 31 2015 altria group inc’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations increased to 44 from 41 and 40 respectively at december 31 2014 altria group inc presently anticipates a decrease of approximately 160 million in its 2016 pretax pension and postretirement expense versus 2015 not including amounts in each year if any related to termination settlement and curtailment this anticipated decrease is due primarily to the impact of the change in approach used to estimate service and interest costs 90 million and the impact of the higher discount rate assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve a 50 basis point decrease in altria group inc’s discount rates would increase altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 50 million and a 50 basis point increase in altria group inc’s discount rates would 

 

decrease altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 43 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria group inc’s pension expense by approximately 35 million see note 16  for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

▪ income taxes   significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions altria group inc’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria group inc records a valuation allowance when it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

altria group inc recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria group inc recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of earnings 

as discussed in note 14  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 14 ” altria group inc recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2015  2014  and 2013  as a result of various tax events 

▪ leasing   substantially all of pmcc’s net revenues in 2015  related to income on leveraged leases and related gains on asset sales income attributable to leveraged leases is initially recorded as unearned income which is included in the line item finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets and subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant aftertax rates of return on the positive net investment balances as discussed in note 7  pmcc lessees are affected by bankruptcy filings credit rating changes and financial market conditions 

pmcc’s investment in leases is included in the line item finance assets net on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2015  and 2014  at december 31 2015  pmcc’s 

net finance receivables of approximately 13 billion which are included in finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheet consisted of rents receivable 21 billion and the residual value of assets under lease 07 billion reduced by thirdparty nonrecourse debt 12 billion and unearned income 03 billion the repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to the general assets of pmcc as required by us gaap the thirdparty nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rents receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets 

finance assets net of 12 billion at december 31 2015  also included an allowance for losses 

estimated residual values represent pmcc’s estimate at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the noncancelable lease terms the estimated residual values are reviewed at least annually by pmcc’s management which includes analysis of a number of factors including activity in the relevant industry if necessary revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values in 2015 and 2014 pmcc’s review of estimated residual values resulted in a decrease of 65 million and 63 million respectively to unguaranteed residual values these decreases in unguaranteed residual values resulted in a reduction to pmcc’s net revenues of 41 million  and 26 million  in 2015 and 2014 respectively there were no such adjustments in 2013 

pmcc considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date pmcc stops recording income “nonaccrual status” on rents receivable when contractual payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain payments received on rents receivable that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance writeoffs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible there were no rents receivable on nonaccrual status at december 31 2015  

to the extent that rents receivable due to pmcc may be uncollectible pmcc records an allowance for losses against its finance assets losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable pmcc regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur pmcc considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses for further discussion see note 7  

 

consolidated operating results 

as discussed further in note 15  altria group inc’s chief operating decision maker reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the segments operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before amortization of intangibles and general corporate expenses management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments 

the following events that occurred during 2015  2014  and 2013  affected the comparability of statement of earnings amounts 

▪ npm adjustment items     for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 pretax income for npm adjustment items was recorded in altria group inc’s consolidated statements of earnings as follows

during 2014 altria group inc and pm usa recorded an aggregate pretax charge of 31 million in marketing administration and research costs for the estimated costs of implementing the corrective communications remedy in connection with the federal government’s lawsuit against altria group inc and pm usa for further discussion see health care cost recovery litigation  federal government’s lawsuit  in note 18  

▪ asset impairment exit integration and acquisitionrelated costs pretax asset impairment exit integration and acquisitionrelated costs for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were 11 million 21 million and 11 million respectively 

for 2014 these costs consisted primarily of integration and acquisitionrelated costs of 28 million related to the acquisition of green smoke partially offset by a pretax gain of 10 million  from the sale of pm usa’s cabarrus north carolina manufacturing facility in 2014 for further discussion of the green smoke acquisition see note 3 

▪ loss on early extinguishment of debt   during 2015 and 2013 altria group inc completed debt tender offers to purchase for cash certain of its senior unsecured notes in aggregate principal amounts of 08 billion  and 21 billion  respectively 

during 2014 ust redeemed in full its 300 million  aggregate principal amount 575  senior notes due 2018

2015 compared with 2014 

the following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2015  with the year ended december 31 2014  

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers increased 912 million 37 due primarily to higher net revenues in the smokeable products segment 

cost of sales decreased 45 million 06 due primarily to lower resolution expenses due principally to the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout payments after the third quarter of 2014 and higher npm adjustment items in 2015 partially offset by higher manufacturing costs in the smokeable products and smokeless products segments 

marketing administration and research costs increased 169 million 67 due primarily to higher costs in the smokeable products segment which included higher tobacco and health litigation items 

operating income increased 741 million 97 due primarily to higher operating results from the smokeable products and smokeless products segments 

interest and other debt expense net increased 9 million 11 due primarily to interest income recorded during 2014 and the reversal of interest income recorded during 2015 as a result of the npm adjustment items and higher interest costs related to tobacco and health litigation items mostly offset by 

lower interest costs on debt as a result of debt refinancing activities in 2015 and 2014 

earnings from altria group inc’s equity investment in sabmiller which decreased 249 million 248 were negatively affected by sabmiller special items and unfavorable currency impacts from a stronger us dollar 

net earnings attributable to altria group inc of 5241 million increased 171 million 34 due primarily to higher operating income partially offset by lower earnings from altria group inc’s equity investment in sabmiller and higher losses on early extinguishment of debt diluted and basic eps attributable to altria group inc of 267 each increased by 43 due to higher net earnings attributable to altria group inc and fewer shares outstanding 

2014 compared with 2013 

the following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2014  with the year ended december 31 2013  

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers were essentially unchanged due primarily to higher net revenues in all reportable segments offset by lower gains on asset sales in the financial services business 

excise taxes on products decreased 226 million 33 due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume 

cost of sales increased 579 million 80 due primarily to higher npm adjustment items in 2013 

marketing administration and research costs increased 199 million 85 due primarily to higher investment spending in the innovative tobacco products businesses lower reductions to the allowance for losses in the financial services business and higher costs in the smokeable products segment 

operating income decreased 464 million 57 due primarily to lower operating results from the smokeable products segment which reflected higher npm adjustment items in 2013 higher investment spending in the innovative tobacco products businesses and lower income from the financial services business partially offset by higher operating results from the smokeless products segment 

interest and other debt expense net decreased 241 million 230 due primarily to lower interest costs on debt as a result of debt maturities in 2013 and 2014 and debt refinancing activities during 2013 as well as interest income recorded in 2014 as a result of the npm adjustment items 

net earnings attributable to altria group inc of 5070 million increased 535 million 118 due primarily to lower losses on early extinguishment of debt lower interest and other debt expense net partially offset by lower operating income diluted and basic eps attributable to altria group inc of 256 each increased by 133 due to higher net earnings attributable to altria group inc and fewer shares outstanding 

 

operating results by business segment 

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the united states tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail below in note 18 item 1a and item 3 include 



 in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries our tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products such as evapor products while the evapor category grew significantly in recent years nu mark estimates a slowdown in growth during 2015 

altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the united states through innovation and adjacency growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties for example nu mark entered the evapor category in 2013 see the discussions regarding new product technologies adjacency growth strategy and evolving consumer preferences in item 1a for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion 

we have provided additional detail on the following topics below 

 fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our cigarette and smokeless tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action under the fsptca the fda has broad authority to 1 regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products 2 require disclosures of related information and 3 enforce the fsptca and related regulations 

among other measures the fsptca 

 



 in april 2014 the fda issued proposed regulations for other tobacco products which as proposed would include machinemade large cigars evapor products pipe tobacco and oral tobaccoderived nicotine products marketed and sold by some of our tobacco subsidiaries the proposed regulations would impose the fsptca regulatory framework on products manufactured marketed and sold by middleton and nu mark with potentially wideranging impact on their businesses see fda regulatory actions  proposed deeming regulations below 

▪ implementation timing rulemaking and guidance   the implementation of the fsptca began in 2009 and will continue over time the provisions of the fsptca that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and for some issues scientific review from time to time the fda also issues guidance for public comment which may be issued in draft or final form 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries participate actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states territories and localities of the united states of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements  below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs and user fees regulations imposed and other regulatory actions taken by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries in a number of different ways for example actions by the fda could 



 

 the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions could also have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the fsptca imposes fees on tobacco product manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares all as prescribed by the statute and fda regulations payments for user fees are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the fda user fee payments on altria group inc see financial review  offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date but could become material either individually or in the aggregate and will depend on the nature of the requirements imposed by the fda 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings monetary penalties product withdrawals and recalls and product seizures the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of altria group inc or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 



of the voting members of the tpsac have financial and other conflicts including service as paid experts for plaintiffs in tobacco litigation in july 2014 the district court granted plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion in part and denied defendants’ summary judgment motion ordering the fda to reconstitute the tpsac and barring defendants from relying on the tpsac report on menthol discussed below the fda appealed to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in september 2014 on january 15 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the trial court’s ruling on procedural grounds finding that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring suit 

 in march 2011 pm usa submitted a report to the fda outlining its position that neither science nor other evidence demonstrates that regulatory actions or restrictions related to the use of menthol cigarettes are warranted the report noted pm usa’s belief that significant restrictions on the use of menthol cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society the fda has stated that the tpsac report is only a recommendation and in july 2013 the fda released its preliminary scientific evaluation on menthol which states “that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes” at the same time the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comments on the fda’s preliminary scientific evaluation and information that may inform potential regulatory actions regarding menthol in cigarettes or other tobacco products in november 2013 pm usa submitted comments to the fda raising a number of concerns with the preliminary scientific evidence and about unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society no future action can be taken by the fda to regulate the manufacture marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes including a possible ban until the completion of the rulemaking process 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca the fda repromulgated in march 2010 a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the “final tobacco marketing rule” the final tobacco marketing rule 



 

 subject to the limitations described below the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 at the time of the repromulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the socalled “1000 foot rule” which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds pm usa and usstc submitted comments on this advance notice 

since enactment several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the fsptca and the final tobacco marketing rule including their constitutionality and the scope of the fda’s authority thereunder altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries are not parties to any of these lawsuits as a result of one such challenge  commonwealth brands  the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising is unenforceable by the fda for a further discussion of the final tobacco marketing rule and the status of graphic warnings for cigarette packages and advertising see fda regulatory actions  graphic warnings  below 

in a separate lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of an fda regulation that restricts tobacco manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a nontobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products the case was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation by which the fda agreed not to enforce the current or any amended trade name rule against plaintiffs until at least 180 days after rulemaking on the amended rule concludes   this relief only applies to plaintiffs in the case however in may 2010 the fda issued guidance on the use of nontobacco trade and brand names applicable to all cigarette and smokeless tobacco product manufacturers this guidance indicated the fda’s intention not to commence enforcement actions under the regulation while it considers how to address the concerns raised by various manufacturers in november 2011 the fda proposed an amended rule but has not yet issued a final rule 

 manufacturers intending to introduce new products and certain modified products into the market after march 22 2011 must submit a report to the fda and obtain a “substantial equivalence order” from the fda before introducing the products into the market if the fda declines to issue a socalled “substantial equivalence order” for a product or if the manufacturer itself determines that the product does not meet the substantial equivalence requirements the product would need to undergo the new product application process 

 

the fda began announcing its decisions on substantial equivalence reports in the second quarter of 2013 however there are a significant number of substantial equivalence reports for which the fda has not announced decisions at this time it is not possible to predict how long reviews by the fda of substantial equivalence reports or new product applications will take “not substantially equivalent” determinations could have a material adverse impact on the business results of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

in march 2015 the fda issued a document entitled “guidance for industry demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions” “substantial equivalence guidance” in that document the fda announced that i certain label changes and ii changes to the quantity of tobacco products in a package would each require submission of newly required substantial equivalence reports and authorization from the fda prior to marketing tobacco products with such changes even when the tobacco product itself is not changed pm usa and usstc market various products that fall within the scope of the substantial equivalence guidance 

in april 2015 pm usa usstc and other tobacco product manufacturers filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the fda the united states department of health and human services and the heads of both agencies seeking to declare these new requirements invalid and to enjoin defendants from enforcing them in may 2015 the fda announced that it was continuing to consider the substantial equivalence guidance in light of comments received and that it would not enforce the requirements under such guidance until further notice in light of the fda’s announcement the plaintiffs dismissed the pending lawsuit without prejudice in june 2015 

in september 2015 the fda issued a second edition of the substantial equivalence guidance the “revised se guidance” which continues to require fda preauthorization for certain label changes and for product quantity changes pm usa usstc and other tobacco product manufacturers filed a new lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the same defendants named in the prior suit seeking to declare the requirements of the revised se guidance invalid and to enjoin defendants from enforcing them on october 30 2015 plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment defendants opposed the motion for summary judgment and moved to dismiss the complaint on december 8 2015 



proposed   regulations in april 2014 that would impose the fsptca regulatory framework on machinemade large cigars evapor products pipe tobacco and chewable tobaccoderived nicotine products nu mark and middleton submitted comments on the proposed regulations in august 2014 nu mark’s submission covers a number of topics including its perspective on 1 the guiding principles that the fda should follow to help ensure successful implementation of the deeming regulation 2 the potential for evapor products and other tobaccoderived nicotine products to reduce tobaccorelated harm and 3 the establishment of product approval pathways that encourage innovation of potentially reduced harm products middleton’s comments covered its perspective on the overall regulation of cigars and on the use of the word “mild” in the black  mild brand name the proposed regulations suggested that the fda may apply the descriptor prohibition to cigars and pipe tobacco which could potentially prohibit the use of the word “mild” in the black  mild  brand name as reflected in the comments middleton believes neither the fda’s regulatory authority nor the first or fifth amendments to the united states constitution allow the fda to ban words such as “mild” regardless of the context and that the fda can only prohibit the word “mild” when used as a descriptor of modified risk 

excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the united states 

federal state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade far outpacing the rate of inflation by way of example in 2009 the federal excise tax “fet” on cigarettes increased from 039 per pack to approximately 101 per pack in 2010 the new york state excise tax increased by 160 to 435 per pack and in october 2014 philadelphia pennsylvania enacted a 200 per pack local cigarette excise tax between the end of 1998 and february 22 2016 the weightedaverage state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from 036 to 154 per pack during 2015 alabama nevada kansas vermont louisiana ohio rhode island and connecticut enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise taxes as of february 22 2016 no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2016 the federal budget released by the president in february 2016 proposes significant increases in the fet for all tobacco products the proposed budget would increase the fet on a pack of cigarettes by 094 per pack raising the total fet to 195 per pack and would also increase the tax on other tobacco products by a proportionate amount it is not possible to predict whether this proposed fet increase will be enacted 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco 

 

subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the sales volume and reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria group inc’s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 22 2016 the federal government 22 states puerto rico philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 22 2016 179 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the united states is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would among other things establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising marketing promotion and sponsorship initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting implement regulations imposing product testing disclosure and performance standards impose health warning requirements on packaging adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products in addition the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” was approved by the conference of parties to the fctc in november 2012 it includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture distribution and sale of tobacco products the protocol has not yet entered into force but in any event will not 

apply to the united states until the senate ratifies the fctc and until the president signs and the senate ratifies the protocol it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the united states either indirectly or as a result of the united states becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 18 during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation operating income market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements on altria group inc see financial review  off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation  below and note 18 the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 

other federal state and local regulation and activity 

▪ federal state and local regulation a number of states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products including innovative tobacco products such as evapor products such as legislation that 1 prohibits the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors 2 requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federallymandated health warnings and 3 restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco 

 

products including proposals to ban all tobacco product sales or to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products above the current federal minimum age requirement of 18 the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions for example a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint or wintergreenflavored products 

whether other states or localities will enact legislation in these areas and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted cannot be predicted altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries have challenged and will continue to challenge certain state and local legislation including through litigation 

▪ health effects of tobacco consumption and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the united states surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products 

reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including in a january 2014 united states surgeon general report titled “the health consequences of smoking  50 years of progress” and in a june 2006 united states surgeon general report on ets titled “the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke” 

most jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting minors it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes require tax stamping of mst products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that would materially adversely affect the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

▪ governmental investigations from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters altria group inc and its subsidiaries cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced 

illicit trade in tobacco products 

illicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries illicit trade can take many forms including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products the sale of tobacco products in the united states that are intended for sale outside the country the sale of tobacco products over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another counterfeit tobacco products for example are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments counterfeit versions of pm usa usstc or middleton products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands illicit trade in tobacco products also harms lawabiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries have made in legitimate distribution channels moreover illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal state and local governments losing tax revenues losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions including increasing excise taxes imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows and the businesses of its tobacco subsidiaries or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold 

altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries devote significant resources to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products and to protect legitimate trade channels for example altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries are engaged in a number of initiatives to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products including communication with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities enforcement of wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products engagement with and support of law enforcement and regulatory agencies litigation to protect their trademarks and support for a variety of federal and state 

 

legislative initiatives legislative initiatives to address illicit trade in tobacco products are designed to protect the legitimate channels of distribution impose more stringent penalties for the violation of illegal trade laws and provide additional tools for law enforcement regulatory measures and related governmental actions to prevent the illicit manufacture and trade of tobacco products continue to evolve as the nature of illicit tobacco products evolves 

price availability and quality of agricultural products 

shifts in crops such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns government mandated prices and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products as with other agriculture commodities the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply any significant change in the price quality or availability of tobacco leaf or other agricultural products used to manufacture our products could adversely affect our subsidiaries’ profitability and businesses 

timing of sales 

in the ordinary course of business our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events the timing of promotions customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and taxdriven price increases

in connection with the settlement with the 24 signatory states of certain npm adjustment disputes under the msa the formula for allocating the revised npm adjustments applicable to the signatory states for 2013 and subsequent years among the tobacco product manufacturers that are original signatories to the msa “opms” has been modified in a manner favorable to pm usa although the extent to which it remains favorable to pm usa will depend upon future developments similarly in connection with the settlement with new york of certain npm adjustment disputes under the msa the formula for allocating among the opms the revised npm adjustments applicable to new york for years after 2014 has been modified in a manner favorable to pm usa although the extent to which it remains favorable to pm usa will depend upon future developments for a detailed discussion of settlements of and determinations made in connection with disputes with certain states and territories related to the npm adjustment provision under the msa for the years 20032012 see health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 18 

based on current agreements 2015 market share and historical annual industry volume decline rates the estimated amounts that altria group inc’s subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to state settlement agreements and fda user fees approximate 49 billion in 2016 and each year thereafter the increase in these amounts compared with approximately 48 billion charged to cost of sales in 2015 reflects the impact of the npm adjustments recorded in 2015 these amounts exclude the potential impact of the npm adjustment provision applicable under the msa and the revised npm adjustment provisions applicable under the settlements of the npm adjustment disputes with the 24 signatory states and with new york respectively for years after 2014 discussed above 

the estimated amounts due under the state settlement agreements charged to cost of sales in each year would generally be paid in the following year the amounts charged to cost of sales for fda user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred as previously stated the payments due under the terms of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors including volume operating income inflation and certain contingent events and in general are allocated based on each manufacturer’s market share the future payment amounts discussed above are estimates and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results

a result of fetra altria group inc’s subsidiaries recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately 03 billion during the year ended december 31 2014 and approximately 04 billion for each of the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

the quota buyout and the expiration of the quota buyout did not have a material impact on altria group inc’s 2014 consolidated results 

usstc purchases burley dark firecured and aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants 

middleton purchases burley and dark aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf merchants middleton does not have a contract growing program

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including competition from many larger wellestablished domestic and international companies as well as from many smaller wine producers wine segment competition is primarily based on quality price consumer and trade wine tastings competitive wine judging thirdparty acclaim and advertising substantially all of ste michelle’s sales occur through statelicensed distributors

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our results of operations our cash flows our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

we 1  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec reports to security holders press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements  

1  this section uses the terms “we” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria group inc and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k “item 7” you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

unfavorable litigation outcomes could materially adversely affect the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria group inc or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 46 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 18 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 18” tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in 

 

several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation pm usa faces potentially significant nonmonetary remedies for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in note 18 the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain 

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or the businesses of one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k “item 3” note 18 and exhibits 991 and 992 to this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

significant federal state and local governmental actions including actions by the fda and various private sector actions may continue to have an adverse impact on our tobacco subsidiaries’ businesses 

as described in tobacco space  business environment in item 7   pm usa faces significant governmental and private sector actions including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and efforts seeking to hold pm usa responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke these actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels 

actions by the fda other federal state or local governments or agencies including those actions described in tobacco space  business environment  in item 7 may impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products limit adult tobacco consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco 

products or products with claims of reduced risk restrict communications to adult tobacco consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements require the recall or removal of tobacco products from the marketplace including without limitation as a result of product contamination interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business or restrict or prevent the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments any one or more of these actions may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

tobacco products are subject to substantial taxation which could have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes  in item 7  

our tobacco businesses face significant competition and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the business of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states among other factors have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has 

 

experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands in the cigar category additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machinemade large cigars manufactured offshore 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult consumer preferences responding to changes in consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult economic conditions 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 

▪ promote brand equity successfully 

 ▪ improve productivity and 

 see tobacco space  business environment    summary  in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences including increased consumer awareness of and expenditures on evapor products continued growth of this product category could further contribute to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and could adversely affect the growth rates of other tobacco products 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions which could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its subsidiaries in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products 

our financial services business conducted through pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries may be unsuccessful in developing and commercializing innovative tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries continue to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products including new product technologies that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences examples include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful these efforts may include arrangements with or investments in third parties our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in these efforts which would have an adverse effect on the ability to grow new revenue streams 

further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk to consumers the speed with which they may make such determinations or whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products nor can we predict whether adult tobacco consumers’ purchasing decisions would be affected by such claims if permitted adverse developments on any of these matters could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products 

if our tobacco subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative tobacco products or to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing or sale of products with claims of reduced risk but one or more of their competitors do succeed our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries’ ability to grow new revenue streams may be limited if our operating companies are unable to move successfully into complementary products or processes 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful see the immediately preceding paragraph for a related discussion concerning new product technologies 

significant changes in tobacco leaf price availability or quality could have an adverse effect on the profitability and business of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  price availability and quality    of agricultural products in item 7  

because altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or 

 

financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any significant suppliers of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of altria group inc’s subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

altria group inc may be unable to attract and retain the best talent due to the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

acquisitions or other events may adversely affect altria group inc’s credit rating and altria group inc may not achieve its anticipated strategic or financial objectives 

altria group inc from time to time considers acquisitions and may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

disruption and uncertainty in the debt capital markets could adversely affect altria group inc’s access to the debt capital markets earnings and dividend rate 

access to the debt capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the credit and debt capital markets and any resulting adverse impact on credit availability pricing andor credit terms may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

altria group inc’s reported earnings from and carrying value of its equity investment in sabmiller may be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and other factors 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller are translated into us dollars from various local currencies during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer us dollars the earnings from and carrying value of our equity investment in sabmiller are also subject to the risks encountered by sabmiller in its business 

altria group inc may be required to write down intangible assets including goodwill due to impairment which would reduce earnings 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

competition unfavorable changes in grape supply and new governmental regulations or revisions to existing governmental regulations could adversely affect ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment  in item 7 

the failure of altria group inc’s information systems to function as intended or the penetration by outside parties intent on disrupting business processes could result in significant costs loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data and reputational harm 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business 

 

data and communicate internally and externally with employees investors suppliers trade customers adult tobacco consumers and others many of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data cause damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands and result in legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

unfavorable outcomes of any governmental investigations could materially affect the businesses of altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations 

expanding international business operations subjects altria group inc and its subsidiaries to various united states and foreign laws and regulations and violations of such laws or regulations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs 

while altria group inc and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees or third parties violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs

executive summary 

the following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in altria group inc’s net earnings and diluted earnings per share “eps” attributable to altria group inc for the year ended december 31 2014  from the year ended december 31 2013  were due primarily to the following 



see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 

 ▪ lower interest and other debt expense net 

partially offset by 

 ▪ lower income from the financial services business 

for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis 

2015 forecasted results 

in january 2015 altria group inc forecasted that its 2015 fullyear adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 7 to 9 over 2014 fullyear adjusted diluted eps this forecasted growth rate excludes the net expenses in the table below 

the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast 

expense income net excluded from adjusted diluted eps 



1  the 2015 amount represents a provision that will be recorded by pm usa in the first quarter of 2015 related to the tentative agreement to resolve approximately 415 pending federal engle  progeny cases 

see item 3 

altria group inc reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” altria group inc’s management reviews certain financial results including diluted eps on an adjusted basis which exclude certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example loss on early extinguishment of debt restructuring charges sabmiller special items certain tax items charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items and settlements of and determinations made in connection with disputes with certain states and territories related to the nonparticipating manufacturer “npm” adjustment provision under the 1998 master settlement agreement the “msa” for the years 20032012 such settlements and determinations are referred to collectively as “npm adjustment items” and are more fully described in health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 18 altria group inc’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria group inc’s sustainable results as they may be highly variable are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria group inc’s management believes that these adjusted financial measures provide useful 

 

insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria group inc’s chief operating decision maker for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with us gaap and should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap 

altria group inc’s fullyear adjusted diluted eps guidance excludes the impact of certain income and expense items including those items noted in the preceding paragraph altria group inc’s management cannot estimate on a forwardlooking basis the impact of these items on altria group inc’s reported diluted eps because these items which could be significant are difficult to predict and may be highly variable as a result altria group inc does not provide a corresponding us gaap measure for or a reconciliation to its adjusted diluted eps guidance 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria group inc must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria group inc’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include altria group inc as well as its whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in which altria group inc exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

▪ revenue recognition   altria group inc’s businesses recognize revenues net of sales incentives and sales returns and including shipping and handling charges billed to 

customers upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized altria group inc’s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria group inc depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria group inc reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria group inc performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria group inc groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria group inc also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets recorded by altria group inc at december 31 2014  relate primarily to the acquisitions of green smoke in 2014 ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007 altria group inc conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group inc to perform an interim review if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows the intangible 

 

asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets by reporting unit at december 31 2014  were as follows 



during 2014  2013  and 2012  altria group inc completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and no impairment charges resulted 

at december 31 2014 i the estimated fair values of the indefinitelived intangible assets within the smokeless products cigars and wine reporting units except for the skoal trademark in the smokeless products reporting unit and the columbia crest trademark in the wine reporting   unit substantially exceeded their carrying values ii the carrying values of the skoal  and columbia crest  trademarks were 39 billion and 54 million respectively and iii the estimated fair value of the smokeless products reporting unit did not substantially exceed its carrying value 

at december 31 2014 the estimated fair value of the skoal  trademark exceeded its carrying value by approximately 17 and the estimated fair value of the smokeless products reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 20 in the smokeless products reporting unit 2014 results for skoal  were impacted by strategies to enhance skoal ’s equity and targeted investments to narrow price gaps which are expected to strengthen the brand over the long term in addition usstc estimates that the smokeless products category volume growth rate slowed to approximately 2 for 2014 as compared to approximately 55 for 2013 usstc continues to believe that the smokeless category’s growth rate is best determined over a longer time horizon and will continue to monitor industry volume closely 

in 2014 altria group inc used an income approach to estimate the fair values of its reporting units and its indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 10 

in performing the 2014 discounted cash flow analysis altria group inc made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group inc’s longterm financial forecast and also included market participant assumptions regarding the highest and best use of altria group inc’s indefinitelived intangible assets assumptions are also 

made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group inc’s control 

although altria group inc’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant 

judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria group inc’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions federal state and local regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes 

while altria group inc’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets see note 4  

▪ marketing costs   altria group inc’s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs consumer incentives and trade promotions such programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives event marketing and volumebased incentives consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies   as discussed in note 18  and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic 

 

cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due pm usa usstc and middleton were also subject to payment obligations imposed by fetra the fetra payment obligations expired after the third quarter of 2014 in addition in june 2009 pm usa and usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements fetra and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria group inc’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales as a result of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees altria group inc’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 49 billion 44 billion and 51 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the 2014 and 2013 amounts included reductions to cost of sales of 43 million and 664 million respectively related to the npm adjustment items discussed further below and in health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 18  in addition the 2014 amount included a decrease in the charge to cost of sales of approximately 100 million reflecting the expiration of the obligations imposed by fetra after the third quarter of 2014 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except to the extent discussed in note 18  and item 3 i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings 

▪ employee benefit plans   as discussed in note 16  benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 16 ” altria group inc provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance altria group inc records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets mortality compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria group inc reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria group inc recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 

at december 31 2014  altria group inc’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans decreased to 41  and 40  respectively from 49 and 48 respectively at december 31 2013  in addition at december 31 2014 altria group inc updated its mortality assumptions to reflect longer life expectancy for its defined benefit pension plan and postretirement health care plan participants altria group inc presently anticipates an increase of approximately 100 million in its 2015 pretax pension and postretirement expense versus 2014 not including amounts in each year if any related to termination settlement and curtailment this anticipated increase is due primarily to the impact of the updated mortality assumptions 70 million the impact of the lower discount rate was largely offset by the impact of higher than expected returns on plan assets a 50 basis point decrease increase in altria group inc’s discount rates would increase decrease altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by approximately 52 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria group inc’s pension expense by approximately 34 million see note 16  for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

▪ income taxes   significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions altria group inc’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria group inc records a valuation allowance when it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

altria group inc recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria group inc recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of earnings 

as discussed in note 14  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “ note 14 ” altria group inc recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2014  2013  and 2012  as a result of various tax events 

▪ leasing   substantially all of pmcc’s net revenues in 2014  related to income on leveraged leases and related gains on asset sales income attributable to leveraged leases is initially 

 

recorded as unearned income which is included in the line item finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets and subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant aftertax rates of return on the positive net investment balances as discussed in note 7  pmcc lessees are affected by bankruptcy filings credit rating changes and financial market conditions 

pmcc’s investment in leases is included in the line item finance assets net on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014  and 2013  at december 31 2014  pmcc’s 

net finance receivables of approximately 17 billion which are included in finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheet consisted of rents receivable 34 billion and the residual value of assets under lease 08 billion reduced by thirdparty nonrecourse debt 21 billion and unearned income 04 billion the repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to the general assets of pmcc as required by us gaap the thirdparty nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rents receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets finance assets net of 16 billion at december 31 2014  also included an allowance for losses 

estimated residual values represent pmcc’s estimate at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the noncancelable lease terms the estimated residual values are reviewed annually by pmcc’s management which includes analysis of a number of factors including activity in the relevant industry if necessary revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values in 2014 and 2012 pmcc’s annual review of estimated residual values resulted in a decrease of 63 million and 19 million respectively to unguaranteed residual values these decreases in unguaranteed residual values resulted in a reduction to pmcc’s net revenues of 26 million  and 8 million  in 2014 and 2012 respectively there were no  such adjustments in 2013 

pmcc considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date pmcc stops recording income “nonaccrual status” on rents receivable when contractual payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain payments received on rents receivable that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance writeoffs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible there were no rents receivable on nonaccrual status at december 31 2014  

to the extent that rents receivable due to pmcc may be uncollectible pmcc records an allowance for losses against its finance assets losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable pmcc regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if 

default were to occur pmcc considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses for further discussion see note 7  

consolidated operating results 

as discussed further in note 15  altria group inc’s chief operating decision maker reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the segments operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before amortization of intangibles and general corporate expenses management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments 

the following events that occurred during 2014  2013  and 2012  affected the comparability of statement of earnings amounts 

▪ npm adjustment items     for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 pretax income for npm adjustment items was recorded in altria group inc’s consolidated statements of 

 

earnings as follows

▪ asset impairment exit integration and acquisitionrelated costs    pretax asset impairment exit integration and acquisitionrelated costs for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 21 million 11 million and 61 million respectively 

for 2014 these costs consisted primarily of integration and acquisitionrelated costs of 28 million related to the acquisition of green smoke partially offset by a pretax gain of 10 million from the sale of pm usa’s cabarrus north carolina manufacturing facility during the second quarter of 2014 for further discussion of the green smoke acquisition see note 3  

for 2012 these costs were primarily due to altria group inc’s cost reduction program announced in 2011 the “2011 cost reduction program” 

for a breakdown of asset impairment and exit costs by segment see note 15  

▪ pmcc leveraged lease benefit   during the second quarter of 2012 altria group inc entered into a closing agreement the “closing agreement” with the internal revenue service “irs” that conclusively resolved the federal income tax treatment for all prior and future tax years of certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by pmcc as a result of the closing agreement altria group inc recorded a onetime net earnings benefit of 68 million during the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to lower than estimated interest on tax underpayments see note 7  and note 14  for a further discussion of the closing agreement

▪ tax items   tax items for 2014 included the reversal of tax accruals no longer required tax items for 2013 included the reversal of tax accruals no longer required and the recognition of previously unrecognized foreign tax credits primarily associated with sabmiller dividends excluding the tax impact included in the pmcc leveraged lease benefit tax items for 2012 included the reversal of tax reserves and associated interest due primarily to the closure in 2012 of the irs audit of altria group inc and its consolidated subsidiaries’ 2004  2006 tax years for further discussion see note 14

the following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2014  with the year ended december 31 2013  

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers were essentially unchanged due primarily to higher net revenues in all reportable segments offset by lower gains on asset sales in the financial services business

business and higher costs in the smokeable products segment 

operating income decreased 464 million 57 due primarily to lower operating results from the smokeable products segment which reflected higher npm adjustment items in 2013 higher investment spending in the innovative tobacco products businesses and lower income from the financial services business partially offset by higher operating results from the smokeless products segment 

interest and other debt expense net decreased 241 million 230 due primarily to lower interest costs on debt as a result of debt maturities in 2013 and 2014 and debt refinancing activities during 2013 as well as interest income recorded in 2014 as a result of the npm adjustment items 

net earnings attributable to altria group inc of 5070 million increased 535 million 118 due primarily to lower losses on early extinguishment of debt lower interest and other debt expense net partially offset by lower operating income diluted and basic eps attributable to altria group inc of 256 each increased by 133 due to higher net earnings attributable to altria group inc and fewer shares outstanding

the following discussion compares consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2013  with the year ended december 31 2012  

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers decreased 152 million 06 due primarily to lower net revenues from the smokeable products segment partially offset by higher net revenues from the smokeless products and wine segments and higher gains on asset sales in the financial services business 

excise taxes on products decreased 315 million 44 due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume 

cost of sales decreased 731 million 92 due primarily to npm adjustment items and lower smokeable products shipment volume partially offset by higher per unit settlement charges

operating income increased 831 million 115 due primarily to higher operating results from the smokeable products segment which includes npm adjustment items and higher operating results from the smokeless products segment partially offset by changes to mondelēz international inc “mondelēz” and pmi taxrelated receivablespayables as discussed further in note 14

sabmiller special items which included gains of 342 million resulting from sabmiller’s strategic alliance transactions with anadolu efes and castel in 2012 

altria group inc’s effective income tax rate decreased 07 percentage points to 347 due primarily to an increased recognition of foreign tax credits in 2013 primarily associated with sabmiller dividends and the resolution of various mondelēz and pmi tax matters during 2013 and 2012 partially offset by the leveraged lease benefit recorded by pmcc during the second quarter of 2012

operating results by business segment 

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the united states tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail below in note 18  item 1a and item 3 include 

 



 

 in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries our tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories or use multiple forms of tobacco products and that approximately 50 of adult smokers say they are interested in trying innovative tobacco products altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries further believe that nearly all adult smokers are aware of evapor products such as electronic cigarettes and approximately 60 have tried them nu mark estimates 2014 total consumer expenditures on evapor products of approximately 2 billion based on annualized sales information 

altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the united states through innovation and adjacency growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties for example nu mark entered the evapor category in 2013 with the introduction of markten  evapor products into two lead markets nu mark completed the national expansion of markten  products in december 2014 in addition as further discussed in note 3   in april 2014 nu mark completed the acquisition of the evapor business of green smoke see the discussions regarding new product technologies adjacency growth strategy and evolving 

consumer preferences in item 1a for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion 

we have provided additional detail on the following topics below 

▪ fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ excise taxes 

▪ international treaty on tobacco control 

▪ state settlement agreements 

▪ other federal state and local regulation and activity 

▪ illicit trade in tobacco products 

 ▪ timing of sales 

fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our cigarette and smokeless tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action under the fsptca the fda has broad authority to 1 regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products 2 require disclosures of related information and 3 enforce the fsptca and related regulations 

among other measures the fsptca 



 

cigarettes nicotine yields and other constituents or ingredients and imposing manufacturing standards for tobacco products 

 in april 2014 the fda issued proposed regulations for other tobacco products which as proposed would include machinemade large cigars evapor products such as electronic cigarettes pipe tobacco and chewable tobaccoderived nicotine products marketed and sold by some of our tobacco subsidiaries the proposed regulations would impose the fsptca regulatory framework including the foregoing measures on products manufactured marketed and sold by nu mark and middleton with potentially wideranging impact on their businesses as discussed below in fda regulatory actions  proposed deeming regulations  nu mark and middleton submitted comments on the proposed regulations in august 2014 

▪ implementation timing rulemaking and guidance the implementation of the fsptca began in 2009 and will continue over time the provisions of the fsptca that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and for some issues scientific review 

from time to time the fda also issues guidance for public comment which may be issued in draft or final form such guidance when finalized is intended to represent the fda’s current thinking on a particular topic and may be predictive of the fda’s enforcement stance on that topic such guidance even 

when finalized is not intended to bind the fda or the public or establish legally enforceable responsibilities 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries participate actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states territories and localities of the united states of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements  below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs and user fees regulations imposed and other regulatory actions taken by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries in a number of different ways for example actions by the fda could 

 the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions could also have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the fsptca imposes fees on tobacco product manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category based on their relative market shares all as prescribed by the statute and fda regulations payments for user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the fda user fee payments on altria group inc see financial review  

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter or year to date but could become material either individually or in the aggregate and will depend on the nature of the requirements imposed by the fda 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings monetary penalties product withdrawals and recalls and product seizures the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of altria group inc or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

▪ tpsac 



menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the united states” the tpsac report noted the potential that any ban on menthol cigarettes could lead to an increase in contraband cigarettes and other potential unintended consequences and suggested that the fda consult with appropriate experts on this matter the tpsac report also recommended that additional research could address gaps in understanding menthol cigarettes 

in march 2011 pm usa submitted a report to the fda outlining its position that neither science nor other evidence demonstrates that regulatory actions or restrictions related to the use of menthol cigarettes are warranted the report noted pm usa’s belief that significant restrictions on the use of menthol cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society the fda has stated that the tpsac report is only a recommendation and in july 2013 the fda released its preliminary scientific evaluation on menthol which states “that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes” at the same time the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comments on the fda’s preliminary scientific evaluation and information that may inform potential regulatory actions regarding menthol in cigarettes or other tobacco products in november 2013 pm usa submitted comments to the fda raising a number of concerns with the preliminary scientific evidence including comments demonstrating that menthol cigarettes do not affect population harm differently than nonmenthol cigarettes pm usa also reiterated that significant restrictions on the use of menthol in cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society no future action can be taken by the fda to regulate the manufacture marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes including a possible ban until the completion of the rulemaking process as noted above the fda is subject to a july 2014 court order that bars it from relying on the tpsac report although the fda is currently appealing that order at this time it is unclear how the fda plans to proceed while that appeal is pending 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca the fda repromulgated in march 2010 a wide range of advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the “final tobacco marketing rule” the final tobacco marketing rule 



 

 subject to the limitations described below the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 at the time of the repromulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the socalled “1000 foot rule” which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds pm usa and usstc submitted comments on this advance notice 

since enactment several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the fsptca and the final tobacco marketing rule including their constitutionality and the scope of the fda’s authority thereunder altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries are not parties to any of these lawsuits as a result of one such challenge  commonwealth brands  the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising is unenforceable by the fda for a further discussion of the final tobacco marketing rule and the status of graphic warnings for cigarette packages and advertising see fda regulatory actions  graphic warnings  below 

in a separate lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of an fda regulation that restricts tobacco manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a nontobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products the case was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to a stipulation by which the fda agreed not to enforce the current or any amended trade name rule against plaintiffs until at least 180 days after rulemaking on the amended rule concludes   this relief only applies to plaintiffs in the case however in may 2010 the fda issued guidance on the use of nontobacco trade and brand names applicable to all cigarette and smokeless tobacco product manufacturers this guidance indicated the fda’s intention not to commence enforcement actions under the regulation while it considers how to address the concerns raised by various manufacturers in november 2011 the fda proposed an amended rule but has not yet issued a final rule 



of smoking the graphic health warnings will i be located beneath the cellophane and comprise the top 50 of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and ii occupy 20 of a cigarette advertisement and be located at the top of the advertisement after a legal challenge to the rule initiated by rj reynolds lorillard and several other plaintiffs in which plaintiffs prevailed both at the federal trial and appellate levels the fda decided not to seek further review of the us court of appeals’ decision and announced its plans to propose a new graphic warnings rule in the future 

 manufacturers intending to introduce new products and certain modified products into the market after march 22 2011 must submit a report to the fda and obtain a “substantial equivalence order” from the fda before introducing the products into the market if the fda declines to issue a socalled “substantial equivalence order” for a product or if the manufacturer itself determines that the product does not meet the substantial equivalence requirements the product would need to undergo the new product application process 

the fda began announcing its decisions on substantial equivalence reports in the second quarter of 2013 however there are a significant number of substantial equivalence reports for which the fda has not announced decisions at this time it is not possible to predict how long reviews by the fda of substantial equivalence reports or new product applications will take 

 

 excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the united states 

federal state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade far outpacing the rate of inflation by way of example in 2009 the fet on cigarettes increased from 039 per pack to approximately 101 per pack in 2010 the new york state excise tax increased by 160 to 435 per pack and in october 2014 philadelphia pennsylvania enacted a 200 per pack local cigarette excise tax between the end of 1998 and february 20 2015 the weightedaverage state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from 036 to 149 per pack during 2014 vermont was the only state to enact a cigarette excise tax increase as of february 20 2015 no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2015 the president’s 

2015 budget proposes significant increases in the fet for all tobacco products the proposed budget would increase the fet on a pack of cigarettes by 094 per pack raising the total fet to 195 per pack and would also increase the tax on other tobacco products by a proportionate amount it is not possible to predict whether this proposed fet increase will be enacted 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the sales volume and reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria group inc’s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 20 2015 the federal government 22 states puerto rico philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 20 2015 178 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the united states is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would among other things establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising marketing promotion and sponsorship initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting implement regulations imposing product testing disclosure and performance standards impose health warning requirements on packaging adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which 

 

call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products in addition the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” was approved by the conference of parties to the fctc in november 2012 it includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture distribution and sale of tobacco products the protocol has not yet entered into force but in any event will not apply to the united states until the senate ratifies the fctc and until the president signs and the senate ratifies the protocol it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the united states either indirectly or as a result of the united states becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 18  during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements on altria group inc see financial review  offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below and note 18  the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 

other federal state and local regulation and activity 

▪ federal state and local regulation a number of states and localities have enacted or proposed legislation that imposes restrictions on tobacco products including innovative tobacco products such as evapor products such as legislation that 1 prohibits the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors 2 requires the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federallymandated health warnings and 3 restricts commercial speech or imposes additional restrictions on the marketing or sale of tobacco products including proposals to ban all tobacco product sales or to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco products above the current federal minimum age requirement of 18 the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products the conditions under which such products are or would be restricted or prohibited and exceptions to the restrictions or prohibitions for example a number of proposals involving characterizing flavors would prohibit smokeless tobacco products with characterizing flavors without providing an exception for mint or wintergreenflavored products 

whether other states or localities will enact legislation in these areas and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted cannot be predicted altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries have challenged and will continue to challenge certain state and local legislation including through litigation for example in january 2014 pm usa middleton and a usstc subsidiary along with other tobacco product manufacturers and three trade associations representing new york city retailers filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the southern district of new york challenging the coupondiscount ban included in a recentlyenacted new york city ordinance on the grounds that it violates the first amendment and is preempted by federal and state law in june 2014 the district court upheld the ordinance 

▪ federal tobacco quota buyout in october 2004 fetra which applied to pm usa middleton and usstc was signed into law fetra eliminated the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the 10year buyout which expired after the third quarter of 2014 was approximately 95 billion and was paid by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product subject to fet the cost was allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of such tobacco product 

for a discussion of the impact of fetra payments on altria group inc see financial review  offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below  neither the quota buyout nor the expiration of the quota buyout had a material impact on our consolidated financial results in 2014 

▪ health effects of tobacco consumption and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” it is the policy of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries to defer to the 

 

judgment of public health authorities as to the content of warnings in advertisements and on product packaging regarding the health effects of tobacco consumption addiction and exposure to ets altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the united states surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products 

reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including in a january 2014 united states surgeon general report titled “the health consequences of smoking  50 years of progress” and in a june 2006 united states surgeon general report on ets titled “the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke” 

most jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting minors it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes require tax stamping of mst products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that might materially adversely affect the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

▪ governmental investigations from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters altria group inc and its 

subsidiaries cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced 

illicit trade in tobacco products 

illicit trade in tobacco products can have an adverse impact on the businesses of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries illicit trade can take many forms including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products the sale of tobacco products in the united states that are intended for sale outside the country the sale of tobacco products over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes and diversion into one taxing jurisdiction of tobacco products intended for sale in another counterfeit tobacco products for example are manufactured by unknown third parties in unregulated environments counterfeit versions of pm usa usstc or middleton products can negatively affect adult tobacco consumer experiences with and opinions of those brands illicit trade in tobacco products also harms lawabiding wholesalers and retailers by depriving them of lawful sales and undermines the significant investment altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries have made in legitimate distribution channels moreover illicit trade in tobacco products results in federal state and local governments losing tax revenues losses in tax revenues can cause such governments to take various actions including increasing excise taxes imposing legislative or regulatory requirements that may adversely impact altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows and the businesses of its tobacco subsidiaries or asserting claims against manufacturers of tobacco products or members of the trade channels through which such tobacco products are distributed and sold 

altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries devote significant resources to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products and to protect legitimate trade channels for example altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries are engaged in a number of initiatives to help prevent illicit trade in tobacco products including communication with wholesale and retail trade members regarding illicit trade in tobacco products and how they can help prevent such activities enforcement of wholesale and retail trade programs and policies that address illicit trade in tobacco products engagement with and support of law enforcement and regulatory agencies litigation to protect their trademarks and support for a variety of federal and state legislative initiatives legislative initiatives to address illicit trade in tobacco products are designed to protect the legitimate channels of distribution impose more stringent penalties for the violation of illegal trade laws and provide additional tools for law enforcement regulatory measures and related governmental actions to prevent the illicit manufacture and trade of tobacco products continue to evolve as the nature of illicit tobacco products evolves 

 

price availability and quality of agricultural products 

shifts in crops such as those driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns government mandated prices and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the supply or quality of tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products as with other agriculture commodities the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could impact tobacco leaf prices and tobacco supply any significant change in the price quality or availability of tobacco leaf or other agricultural products used to manufacture our products could adversely affect our subsidiaries’ profitability and businesses 

timing of sales 

in the ordinary course of business our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events the timing of promotions customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and taxdriven price increases 

operating results 

the following table summarizes operating results for the smokeable and smokeless products segments 

smokeable products segment

channels including the internet direct mail and some illicitly taxadvantaged outlets retail share results for cigars are based on data for machinemade large cigars middleton defines machinemade large cigars as cigars made by machine that weigh greater than three pounds per thousand except cigars sold at retail in packages of 20 cigars because the cigars service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share it is iri’s standard practice to periodically refresh its services which could restate retail share results that were previously released in these services 

pm usa and middleton executed the following pricing and promotional allowance actions during 2014  2013  and 2012

3  amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases 

4  purchase obligations for inventory and production costs such as raw materials indirect materials and supplies packaging storage and distribution are commitments for projected needs to be used in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice usually 30 days any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 

5  other longterm liabilities consist of accrued postretirement health care costs and certain accrued pension costs the amounts included in the table above for accrued pension costs consist of the actuarially determined anticipated minimum funding requirements for each year from 2015 through 2019 contributions beyond 2019 cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore are not included in the table above in addition the following longterm liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above accrued postemployment costs income taxes and tax contingencies and other accruals altria group inc is unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items 

the state settlement agreements and related legal fee payments and payments for fda user fees as discussed below and in note 18  and item 3 are excluded from the table above as the payments are subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume litigation escrow deposits as discussed below and in note 18  are also excluded from the table above since these deposits will be returned to pm usa should it prevail on appeal 

payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation   as discussed previously and in note 18  and item 3 pm usa has entered into state settlement agreements with the states and territories of the united states that call for certain payments pm usa middleton and usstc were also subject to payment obligations imposed by fetra the fetra payment obligations expired after the third quarter of 2014 in addition in june 2009 pm usa and usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca payments under the state settlement agreements fetra and the fda user fees are based on variable factors such as volume market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria group inc’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales as a result of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees altria group inc’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 49 billion 44 billion and 51 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the 2014 and 2013 amounts included reductions to cost of sales of 43 million and 664 million respectively for the npm adjustment items in addition the 2014 amount included a decrease in the charge to cost of sales of approximately 100 million reflecting the expiration of the obligations imposed by fetra after the third quarter of 2014 

in connection with the settlement of the npm adjustment disputes under the msa for the years 20032012 the formula for allocating the revised npm adjustments applicable to the signatory states for 2013 and subsequent years among the tobacco product manufacturers that are original signatories to the msa “opms” has been modified in a manner favorable to pm usa although the extent to which it remains favorable to pm usa will depend upon future developments for a detailed discussion of settlements of and determinations made in connection with disputes with certain states and territories related to the npm adjustment provision under the msa for the years 20032012 see health care cost recovery litigation  npm adjustment disputes  in note 18 

based on current agreements 2014 market share and historical annual industry volume decline rates the estimated amounts that altria group inc’s subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to state settlement agreements and fda user fees approximate 46 billion in 2015 and each year thereafter the decrease in these amounts compared with approximately 49 billion charged to cost of sales in 2014 reflects the expiration of obligations imposed 

 

by fetra after the third quarter of 2014 these amounts exclude the potential impact of the revised and streamlined npm adjustment provision applicable to signatory states for years after 2014 discussed above 

the estimated amounts due under the state settlement agreements charged to cost of sales in each year would generally be paid in the following year the amounts charged to cost of sales for fda user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred as previously stated the payments due under the terms of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors including volume inflation and certain contingent events and in general are allocated based on each manufacturer’s market share the future payment amounts discussed above are estimates and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results

dividends paid in 2014  and 2013  were approximately 39 billion  and 36 billion respectively an increase of 78  reflecting a higher dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased by altria group inc under its share repurchase programs discussed below

▪ cigarettes   pm usa is the largest cigarette company in the united states with total cigarette shipment volume in the united states of approximately 1293 billion  units in 2013  a decrease of 41  from 2012  marlboro  the principal cigarette brand of pm usa has been the largestselling cigarette brand in the united states for over 35 years

▪ distribution competition and raw materials   altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products 

 

principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services 

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts including coupons product promotions and allowances for new products 

in june 2009 the president signed into law the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act “fsptca” which provides the united states food and drug administration “fda” with broad authority to regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products the authority to require disclosures of related information and the authority to enforce the fsptca and related regulations the law also grants the fda authority to extend its application by regulation to all other tobacco products including cigars pipe tobacco and electronic cigarettes the fsptca imposes restrictions on the advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products including at retail the fda has indicated that it intends to regulate cigars electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products but it has not indicated a timeline for the issuance of final regulations pm usa and a subsidiary of usstc are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of this legislation and the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product pm usa usstc and other us tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

in the united states under a contract growing program pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers under the terms of this program pm usa agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts pm usa also purchases a portion of its united states tobacco requirements through leaf merchants in 2003 pm usa and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quotaholders the agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant including pm usa to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from us tobacco growers over a period of at least 10 years these quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement 

tobacco production in the united states was historically subject to government controls including the production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law pm usa usstc and middleton are all subject to obligations imposed by fetra fetra eliminated the federal 

tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout is approximately 95 billion and is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product as a result of fetra altria group inc’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 04 billion of charges to cost of sales during each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 obligations imposed by fetra expire after the third quarter of 2014 

in february 2011 pm usa filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the usda’s method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the fetra buyout described above and used by the fda to calculate the industry’s fda user fees pm usa asserts in this litigation that the usda violated fetra and its own regulations by failing to apply the most current federal excise tax “fet” rates enacted by congress which became effective in april 2009 in calculating the class share allocations pm usa has filed administrative appeals of its fetra assessments beginning in fiscal year 2011 all of which have been denied by the usda and has submitted a petition for rulemaking with the usda which petition was denied by the usda in november 2011 in each case asserting that the usda erroneously failed to base the fetra class share allocations on the current fet rates pm usa is appealing the usda’s calculations methodology as well as the denial of the petition for rulemaking and the denial of its quarterly assessment challenges the cigar association of america has joined the litigation as a defendant intervenor in october 2012 the district court dismissed the case over pm usa’s objection and pm usa appealed on november 20 2013 the appellate court affirmed the district court’s decision 

the quota buyout did not have a material impact on altria group inc’s 2013  consolidated results and altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2014 when the obligations imposed by fetra will expire 

usstc purchases burley dark firecured and aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants 

middleton purchases burley and dark aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf merchants middleton does not have a contract growing program 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements 

wine 

altria group inc acquired ust and its premium wine business ste michelle in january 2009 ste michelle is a producer of premium varietal and blended table wines ste michelle is a leading producer of washington state wines primarily chateau ste michelle   columbia crest  and 14 hands and owns wineries 

 

in or distributes wines from several other wine   regions and foreign countries ste michelle’s total 2013  wine shipment volume of approximately 80 million  cases increased 50  from 2012  

ste michelle   holds an 85 ownership interest in michelleantinori llc which owns stag’s leap wine cellars  in napa valley ste michelle also owns conn creek in napa valley and erath in oregon in addition ste michelle imports and markets antinori  and villa maria estate  wines and champagne nicolas feuillatte  in the united states 

▪ distribution competition and raw materials   key elements of ste michelle’s strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines especially in certain account categories such as restaurants wholesale clubs supermarkets wine shops and mass merchandisers and a focus on improving product mix to higherpriced premium products 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including competition from many larger wellestablished domestic and international companies as well as from many smaller wine producers wine segment competition is primarily based on quality price consumer and trade wine tastings competitive wine judging thirdparty acclaim and advertising substantially all of ste michelle’s sales occur through statelicensed distributors 

federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business 

ste michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production at the present time ste michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements

 item 1a risk factors    

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial position and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

we 1  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other 

 

1  this section uses the terms “we” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria group inc and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to security holders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k “item 7” you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

tobaccorelated litigation    

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contrabandrelated claims patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified 

 

in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts furthermore in those cases where plaintiffs are successful altria group inc or its subsidiaries may also be required to pay interest and attorneys’ fees 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 45 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 18 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 18” tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

in certain litigation pm usa faces potentially significant nonmonetary remedies for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in note 18 the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k “item 3” note 18 and exhibits 991 and 992 to this 

annual report on form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

tobacco regulation and control action in the public and private sectors    

our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental and private sector action including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use restricting marketing and advertising imposing regulations on packaging requiring warnings and disclosure of flavors or other ingredients prohibiting the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors or other characteristics requiring premarket authorization of certain tobacco products limiting or prohibiting the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes and seeking to hold them responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 

pm usa usstc and other altria group inc subsidiaries are subject to regulation and may become subject to additional regulation by the fda as discussed in detail in  tobacco space  business environment  fsptca and fda regulation  in item 7 we cannot predict how the fda will implement and enforce its statutory authority including by promulgating additional regulations taking other regulatory actions and pursuing possible investigatory or enforcement actions 

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels actions by the fda other federal state or local governments or agencies and private sector entities such as those which impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products limit adult consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products restrict communications to adult consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements require the recall or removal of tobacco products from the marketplace including without limitation as a result of product contamination interrupt manufacturing or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business or restrict the use of specified tobacco products in certain locations or the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non 

 

premium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes  in item 7  

increased competition in the united states tobacco categories 

each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states among other factors have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands in the cigar category additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machinemade large cigars manufactured offshore 

new product technologies 

altria group inc’s subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences potential solutions include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful these efforts may include arrangements with or investments in third parties our subsidiaries may not succeed in their efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors does our subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of such products with claims of reduced risk to consumers or whether consumers’ purchase decisions would be affected by such claims nor can we predict whether regulators will impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products any of these developments could adversely affect the commercial viability of any such new products 

adjacency growth strategy 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful for a related discussion see  new product technologies  above 

tobacco price availability and quality 

any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for a discussion of factors that influence leaf prices availability and quality see  tobacco space  business environment  tobacco price availability and quality  in item 7  

tobacco key facilities supply security 

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries or the operations of any significant suppliers of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more altria group inc subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position of altria group inc 

attracting and retaining talent 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

competition evolving adult consumer preferences and economic conditions 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition and changes in adult consumer preferences to be successful they must continue to 

▪ promote brand equity successfully 

▪ anticipate and respond to new and evolving adult consumer preferences 

▪ develop manufacture market and distribute products that appeal to adult consumers including where appropriate through arrangements with or investments in third parties 

▪ improve productivity and 

▪ protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases 

 

see tobacco space  business environment    summary  in item 7 for additional discussion concerning evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences including increased consumer awareness of and expenditures on electronic cigarettes continued growth of this product category could further contribute to reductions in cigarette consumption levels and cigarette industry sales volume and could adversely affect the growth rates of other tobacco products 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions which can have a material adverse effect on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position of altria group inc in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products our tobacco and wine subsidiaries work to broaden their brand portfolios to compete effectively with lowerpriced products 

our financial services business conducted through pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

acquisitions 

altria group inc from time to time considers acquisitions from time to time we may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

capital markets 

access to the capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the capital markets and any resulting tightening of credit availability pricing andor credit terms may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

exchange rates 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings of sabmiller are translated into us dollars from various local currencies based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting 

period during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported equity earnings in sabmiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer us dollars 

asset impairment 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing adult consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

wine  competition grape supply regulation and excise taxes 

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment  in item 7  

information systems 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees investors suppliers customers and others many of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data cause damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands and result in legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

governmental investigations 

from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we 

 

cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations 

international business operations 

while altria group inc and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in business activities in the united states they do engage directly or indirectly in certain international business activities that are subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws prohibiting bribery and corruption although we have a code of conduct and a compliance system designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable law no system can provide assurance that it will always protect against improper actions by employees or third parties violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could result in reputational harm legal challenges andor significant costs

executive summary 

the following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in altria group inc’s net earnings and diluted earnings per share “eps” attributable to altria group inc for the year ended december 31 2013  from the year ended december 31 2012  were due primarily to the following 



1  excludes the tax impact included in the pmcc leveraged lease benefit 

2  reflects the impact of the npm adjustment settlement 016 and the npm arbitration panel decision 005 

see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 

 ▪ higher income from the smokeable products and smokeless products segments 

▪ lower interest and other debt expense net and 

▪ higher earnings from altria group inc’s equity investment in sabmiller excluding special items 

for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis 

2014 forecasted results 

in january 2014 altria group inc forecasted that its 2014 fullyear reported diluted eps is expected to be in the range of 251 to 258 this forecast includes estimated expenses of 001 per share as detailed in the table below as compared with 2013 fullyear reported diluted eps of 226  which included 012  per share of net expenses as detailed in the table below expected 2014 fullyear adjusted diluted eps which excludes the expenses in the table below represents a growth rate of 6 to 9 over 2013 fullyear adjusted diluted eps which excludes the net expenses in the table below 

altria group inc’s core tobacco businesses are positioned to deliver income growth through their leading premium brands altria group inc also expects its 2014 earnings to benefit from lower interest expense a lower effective tax rate and a reduction in shares from the april 2013 share repurchase program however altria group inc plans to continue making disciplined and incremental investments to build its alternative products businesses and expects continued variability in gains from asset sales at pmcc finally although some economic indicators are improving adult tobacco consumers continue to face challenges 

the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast 

expense income net included in reported diluted eps 



1  reflects the impact of the npm adjustment settlement 016 and the npm arbitration panel decision 005 

adjusted diluted eps is a financial measure that is not consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” altria group inc’s management reviews diluted eps on an adjusted basis which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations these items may include for example loss on early extinguishment of debt restructuring charges sabmiller special items certain pmcc leveraged lease items certain tax items tobacco and health judgments and settlements of and determinations made in disputes with certain states related to the nonparticipating manufacturer “npm” adjustment provision “npm 

 

adjustment” under the 1998 master settlement agreement the “msa” altria group inc’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of its sustainable results as they may be highly variable and difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results altria group inc’s management believes it is appropriate to disclose this nongaap financial measure to provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results and to provide a more meaningful comparison of yearoveryear results adjusted measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria group inc’s chief operating decision maker for planning forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements in most instances altria group inc must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria group inc’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include altria group inc as well as its whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in which altria group inc exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

▪ revenue recognition   altria group inc’s businesses recognize revenues net of sales incentives and sales returns and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers upon shipment or delivery of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued 

liabilities until revenue is recognized altria group inc’s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria group inc depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria group inc reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria group inc performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria group inc groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria group inc also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets recorded by altria group inc at december 31 2013  relate primarily to the acquisitions of ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007 altria group inc conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group inc to perform an interim review if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value if the carrying value of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value which is determined using discounted cash flows the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets by reporting unit at december 31 2013  were as follows 



 

during 2013  2012  and 2011  altria group inc completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and no impairment charges resulted 

at december 31 2013  the estimated fair value of the smokeless products reporting unit as well as the estimated fair values of the indefinitelived intangible assets within the smokeless products and wine reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values in addition at december 31 2013 the estimated fair values of the cigars trademarks primarily black  mild  exceeded their carrying values by approximately 18 middleton continues to observe significant competitive activity including higher levels of imported lowpriced machinemade large cigars as a result management concluded after the 2013 review that while the fair values for the cigars trademarks exceeded their carrying values they did not substantially exceed their carrying values 

in 2013 altria group inc used an income approach to estimate the fair values of its reporting units and its indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the average discount rate used in performing the valuations was 10 

in performing the 2013 discounted cash flow analysis altria group inc made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group inc’s longterm financial forecast and also included market participant assumptions regarding the highest and best use of altria group inc’s indefinitelived intangible assets assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group inc’s control 

although altria group inc’s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria group inc’s impairment conclusions general economic conditions federal state and local regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes 

while altria group inc’s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from 

forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets see note 3 

▪ marketing costs   altria group inc’s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs consumer incentives and trade promotions such programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives event marketing and volumebased incentives consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

▪ contingencies   as discussed in note 18 and item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due pm usa also entered into a trust agreement to provide certain aid to us tobacco growers and quota holders but pm usa’s obligations under this trust expired on december 15 2010 these obligations had been offset by the obligations imposed on pm usa by fetra which expires after the third quarter of 2014 usstc and middleton are also subject to obligations imposed by fetra in addition in june 2009 pm usa and a subsidiary of usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca the state settlement agreements fetra and the fda user fees call for payments that are based on variable factors such as volume market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria group inc’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales as a result of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees altria group inc’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 44 billion 51 billion and 50 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 2013 

 

amount included reductions to cost of sales of 664 million related to certain npm adjustment items discussed further below and in health care cost recovery litigation  possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003  2012  in note 18 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated except to the extent discussed in note 18 and item 3 at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings 

▪ employee benefit plans   as discussed in note 16 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 16” altria group inc provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance altria group inc records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria group inc reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria group inc recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of deferred income taxes the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 

at december 31 2013  altria group inc’s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans increased to 49  and 48  respectively from 40 and 39 respectively at december 31 2012  altria group inc presently anticipates a decrease of approximately 146 million in its 2014 pretax pension and postretirement expense versus 2013 not including amounts in each year related to termination settlement and curtailment this anticipated decrease is due primarily to lower amortization of unrecognized losses which includes the impact of the higher discount rate and higher return on plan assets in 2013 a 50 basis point decrease increase in altria group inc’s discount rates would increase decrease altria group inc’s pension and postretirement expense by 

approximately 45 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria group inc’s pension expense by approximately 32 million see note 16 for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

▪ income taxes   significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions altria group inc’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse altria group inc records a valuation allowance when it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

altria group inc recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement altria group inc recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of earnings 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 “note 14” altria group inc recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2013  2012  and 2011  as a result of various tax events 

▪ leasing   substantially all of pmcc’s net revenues in 2013  related to income on leveraged leases and related gains on asset sales income relating to leveraged leases is recorded initially as unearned income which is included in the line item finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets and is subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant aftertax rates of return on the positive net investment balances as discussed in note 7 pmcc lessees are affected by bankruptcy filings credit rating changes and financial market conditions 

pmcc’s investment in leases is included in the line item finance assets net on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2013  and 2012  at december 31 2013  pmcc’s net finance receivables of approximately 19 billion in 

leveraged leases which are included in finance assets net on 

 

altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheet consisted of rents receivable 42 billion and the residual value of assets under lease 11 billion reduced by thirdparty nonrecourse debt 28 billion and unearned income 06 billion the repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to the general assets of pmcc as required by us gaap the thirdparty nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rents receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets finance assets net of 20 billion at december 31 2013  also included net finance receivables for direct finance leases and an allowance for losses 

estimated residual values represent pmcc’s estimate at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the noncancelable lease terms the estimated residual values are reviewed annually by pmcc’s management which includes analysis of a number of factors including activity in the relevant industry if necessary revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values such reviews resulted in a decrease of 8 million in 2012 to pmcc’s net revenues and results of operations there were no adjustments in 2013 and 2011 

pmcc considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date pmcc stops recording income “nonaccrual status” on rents receivable when contractual payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain payments received on rents receivable that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance writeoffs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible there were no rents receivable on nonaccrual status at december 31 2013  

to the extent that rents receivable due to pmcc may be uncollectible pmcc records an allowance for losses against its finance assets losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable pmcc regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur pmcc considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses for further discussion see note 7 

consolidated operating results 

as discussed further in note 15 altria group inc’s chief operating decision maker reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the segments operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before amortization of intangibles and general corporate expenses management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the united states tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail below in note 18 item 1a and item 3 include 



 ▪ governmental investigations 

 in addition to and in connection with the foregoing evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences pose challenges for altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries our tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories or use multiple forms of tobacco products and that approximately 50 of adult smokers say they are interested in trying innovative tobacco products altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries further believe that adult tobacco consumer awareness of electronic cigarettes is high and 

 

growing and estimate that consumer expenditures for evapor products reached approximately 1 billion in the united states in 2013 altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing manufacturing marketing and distributing products both within and outside the united states through innovation and adjacency growth strategies including where appropriate arrangements with or investments in third parties for example nu mark entered the evapor category with the introduction of markten  electronic cigarettes into a lead market in indiana in august 2013 and expanded distribution of markten  electronic cigarettes to arizona in december 2013 nu mark plans to expand markten  electronic cigarettes nationally beginning in the second quarter of 2014 in addition on february 3 2014 altria group inc announced nu mark’s entry into an agreement to acquire the evapor business of green smoke inc and its affiliates see the discussions regarding new product technologies adjacency growth strategy and evolving consumer preferences in item 1a for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion 

we have provided additional detail on the following topics below 

▪ fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ excise taxes 

▪ international treaty on tobacco control 

▪ state settlement agreements 

▪ other federal state and local regulation and activity 

▪ illicit trade 

▪ tobacco price availability and quality and 

▪ timing of sales 

fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our cigarette and smokeless tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action under the fsptca the fda has broad authority 1 to regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products 2 to require disclosures of related information and 3 to enforce the fsptca and related regulations the law also grants the fda authority to extend the fsptca’s application by regulation to all other tobacco products including cigars pipe tobacco and electronic cigarettes the fda has indicated that it intends to regulate cigars electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products but it has not indicated a timeline for the issuance of final regulations 

among other measures the fsptca 

▪ imposes restrictions on the advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products including at retail 

▪ prohibits cigarettes with characterizing flavors other than menthol and tobacco 

▪ bans descriptors such as “light” “mild” or “low” or similar descriptors unless expressly authorized by the fda 

▪ requires extensive ingredient disclosure to the fda and may require more limited public ingredient disclosure 

▪ prohibits any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without fda authorization 

▪ imposes reporting obligations relating to contraband activity and grants the fda authority to impose recordkeeping and other obligations to address illicit trade in tobacco products 

▪ changes the language of the cigarette and smokeless tobacco product health warnings enlarges their size and requires the development by the fda of graphic warnings for cigarettes and gives the fda the authority to require new warnings 

▪ authorizes the fda to adopt product regulations and related actions including 

▪ to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health through a regulatory process including among other possibilities restrictions on ingredients constituents or other properties performance or design criteria as well as to impose testing measurement reporting and disclosure requirements 

▪ to subject tobacco products that are modified or first introduced into the market after march 22 2011 to application and premarket review and authorization requirements the “new product application process” if the fda does not find them to be “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 and to deny any such new product application thus preventing the distribution and sale of any product affected by such denial 

▪ to determine that certain existing tobacco products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between february 15 2007 and march 22 2011 are not “substantially equivalent” to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 in which case the fda could require the removal of such products or subject them to the new product application process and if any such applications are denied prevent the continued distribution and sale of such products see fda regulatory actions  below 

▪ to restrict or otherwise regulate menthol cigarettes as well as other tobacco products with characterizing flavors see tpsac  below 

 

▪ to regulate nicotine yields and to reduce or eliminate harmful constituents or harmful ingredients or other components of tobacco products and 

▪ to impose manufacturing standards for tobacco products and 

▪ equips the fda with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools including the authority to inspect tobacco product manufacturing and other facilities 

 the implementation of the fsptca began in 2009 and will continue over time some provisions took effect immediately some provisions have taken effect since the enactment of the fsptca and other provisions will not take effect for some time those provisions that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and for some issues scientific review altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries participate actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement the fsptca’s regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

from time to time the fda also issues guidance for public comment which may be issued in draft or final form such guidance when finalized is intended to represent the fda’s current thinking on a particular topic and may be predictive of the fda’s enforcement stance on that topic such guidance even when finalized is not intended to bind the fda or the public or establish legally enforceable responsibilities examples of current draft guidance include 

▪ draft guidance for industry and fda staff demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions 

▪ draft guidance for industry modified risk tobacco product applications and 

▪ draft guidance for industry applications for premarket review of new tobacco products 

a complete set of guidance documents issued by the fda can be found on the fda’s website at wwwfdagovtobaccoproductsguidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation the information on this website is not and shall not be deemed to be part of this report or incorporated into any other filings altria group inc makes with the sec 

pm usa and usstc submit comments to the fda on draft or final guidance when appropriate in some cases pm usa and usstc may disagree with a particular interpretation by the fda as expressed in draft or final guidance and may communicate their position in writing to the fda for example pm usa and usstc communicated disagreement with fda interpretations of the statute set forth in the “draft guidance for industry and fda staff demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions” 

regarding when a manufacturer must submit substantial equivalence reports while pm usa and usstc believe that all of their current products meet the statutory requirements of the fsptca they cannot currently predict whether when or how the fda ultimately will apply its guidance or seek to enforce the law and regulations consistent with its guidance as discussed below in investigations and enforcement  fda enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on the business financial position cash flows and results of operations of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states territories and localities of the united states of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements  below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs regulations imposed and other regulatory actions taken by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse effect on the business financial position cash flows and results of operations of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries in a number of different ways for example actions by the fda could 

▪ impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products 

▪ delay discontinue or prevent the sale or distribution of existing new or modified tobacco products 

▪ limit adult consumer choices 

▪ restrict communications to adult consumers 

▪ create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies 

▪ impose additional manufacturing labeling or packaging requirements 

▪ impose additional restrictions at retail 

▪ result in increased illicit trade activities or 

▪ otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business 

the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions could also have a material adverse effect on the business financial position cash flows and results of operations of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the fsptca imposes fees on tobacco product manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation according to a process set out in the statute which relies in part on the allocation methodology set forth in fetra and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective category 

 

based on their relative market shares in may 2013 the fda issued proposed regulations to govern the allocation of the fda user fee after the fetra program concludes in 2014 an altria group inc subsidiary filed comments on behalf of pm usa and usstc objecting to certain aspects of the proposed regulations for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements the fetra and fda user fee payments on altria group inc see financial review  debt and liquidity  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the fsptca’s regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter to date but could become material either individually or in the aggregate and will depend on the nature of the requirements imposed by the fda 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings money penalties product withdrawals and recalls and product seizures the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of altria group inc or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business financial position cash flows and results of operations of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

for example in june 2010 the fda issued a document request regarding changes to marlboro gold pack cigarette packaging in connection with the fsptca’s ban of certain descriptors pm usa submitted documents in response to the fda’s request 

▪ tpsac 



the voting members of the tpsac have financial and other conflicts including services as paid experts for plaintiffs in tobacco litigation that could hamper the full and fair consideration of issues by the tpsac and requested that their appointments be withdrawn pm usa and usstc raised similar concerns related to the engagement of two tpsac subcommittee consultants the fda declined pm usa’s and usstc’s requests stating that the fda had satisfied itself after inquiry that the individuals in question did not have disqualifying conflicts of interest in february 2011 lorillard tobacco company “lorillard” and rj reynolds filed suit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the united states department of health and human services and individual defendants sued in their official capacities asserting that the composition of the tpsac and the composition of the constituents subcommittee of the tpsac violates several federal laws including the federal advisory committee act in august 2012 the district court denied the government’s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint the government defendants filed their motion for summary judgment as to all claims in june 2013 lorillard and rj reynolds filed a crossmotion for summary judgment in july 2013 

▪ tpsac action on menthol as mandated by the fsptca in march 2011 the tpsac submitted to the fda a report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health and related recommendations the tpsac report stated that “menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health in the united states” the tpsac report recommended that the “removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the united states” the tpsac report noted the potential that any ban on menthol cigarettes could lead to an increase in contraband cigarettes and other potential unintended consequences and suggested that the fda consult with appropriate experts on this matter the tpsac report also recommended that additional research could address gaps in understanding menthol cigarettes 

in march 2011 pm usa submitted a report to the fda outlining its position that neither science nor other evidence demonstrates that regulatory actions or restrictions related to the use of menthol cigarettes are warranted the report noted pm usa’s belief that significant restrictions on the use of menthol cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society 

in july 2011 the tpsac revised and approved its march 2011 report the revisions were editorial in nature and did not change the substantive conclusions and recommendations of the tpsac 

the fsptca does not set a deadline or required timeline for the fda to act on the tpsac’s report the fda has stated that the tpsac’s report is only a recommendation and that the fda’s receipt of the tpsac’s report will not have an immediate effect on the availability of menthol cigarettes in january 2012 the fda announced that it had evaluated scientific information on menthol and had drafted a report related to the impact of menthol 

 

in cigarettes on public health the fda indicated that it had sent its report to external scientists for peer review in july 2013 the fda released its preliminary scientific evaluation which states “that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes” at the same time the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comments on the fda’s preliminary scientific evaluation and information that may inform potential regulatory actions regarding menthol in cigarettes or other tobacco products on november 22 2013 pm usa submitted comments to the fda raising a number of concerns with the preliminary scientific evidence including comments demonstrating that menthol cigarettes do not affect population harm differently than nonmenthol cigarettes pm usa also reiterated that significant restrictions on the use of menthol in cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society no future action can be taken by the fda to regulate the manufacture marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes including a possible ban until the completion of the rulemaking process 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca the fda repromulgated in march 2010 certain advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the “final tobacco marketing rule” the final tobacco marketing rule 

 subject to the limitations described below the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 at the time of the repromulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the 

socalled “1000 foot rule” which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds pm usa and usstc submitted comments on this advance notice 

since enactment several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the fsptca and the final tobacco marketing rule including their constitutionality and the scope of the fda’s authority thereunder altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries are not parties to any of these lawsuits in january 2010 in one such challenge  commonwealth brands  the us district court for the western district of kentucky struck down as unconstitutional and enjoined enforcement of the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising and claims implying that a tobacco product is safer because of fda regulation the parties appealed and in march 2012 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s decision the sixth circuit affirmed the district court’s injunction against enforcement of the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising the sixth circuit reversed the injunction against enforcement of the prohibition on claims implying that a tobacco product is safer because of fda regulation the sixth circuit also held that the final tobacco marketing rule’s ban on consumer continuity programs violates the first amendment and reversed the district court’s decision upholding the ban the sixth circuit upheld the fsptca’s statutory requirements for enlarged textual and graphic warnings on cigarette packages and advertising but did not rule upon the constitutionality of the nine graphic warnings actually selected by the fda in its june 2011 final rule in may 2012 the plaintiffs in commonwealth brands filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc  which the sixth circuit denied in october 2012 the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari  in the united states supreme court seeking further review of the sixth circuit’s decision upholding the fsptca’s new enlarged and expanded warning requirements that include graphic warnings the fsptca’s restrictions on modified risk tobacco product claims and certain other provisions of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda did not file a petition for writ of   certiorari with the united states supreme court seeking further review of the sixth circuit’s decision the fda filed its opposition to the plaintiffs’ petition for writ of certiorari  in march 2013 in april 2013 the united states supreme court denied plaintiffs’ petition for writ of certiorari   as a result of this litigation the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising is unenforceable by the fda for a further discussion of the final tobacco marketing rule and the status of graphic warnings for cigarette packages and advertising see fda regulatory actions  graphics warnings  below 

in a separate challenge to the final tobacco marketing rule in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia renegade tobacco company inc and others have challenged the constitutionality of an fda regulation that restricts tobacco 

 

manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a nontobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products in may 2010 the district court issued a stay in the renegade case pending the fda’s consideration of amendments to the trade or brand name rule in november 2011 the fda proposed an amended rule but continues to exercise its discretion to enforce the original trade or brand name provisions of the final tobacco marketing rule according to fda guidance issued in may 2010 it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such litigation or its effect on the extent of the fda’s authority to regulate tobacco products 

▪ contraband the fsptca imposes on manufacturers reporting obligations relating to knowledge of suspected contraband activity involving their brands and also grants the fda the authority to impose certain recordkeeping and other obligations to address illicit trade in tobacco products the fsptca also empowers the fda to assess whether additional tools should be employed to track and trace tobacco products through the distribution chain 



or subject them to the new product application process and if any such applications are denied prevent the continued distribution and sale of such products pm usa and usstc believe all of their current products meet the statute’s requirements but cannot predict when or how the fda will respond to their substantial equivalence reports 

manufacturers intending to introduce new products and certain modified products into the market after march 22 2011 must submit a report to the fda and obtain a “substantial equivalence order” from the agency before introducing the products into the market if the fda declines to issue a socalled “substantial equivalence order” for a product or if the manufacturer itself determines that the product does not meet the substantial equivalence requirements the product would need to undergo the new product application process 

the fda began announcing its decisions on substantial equivalence reports in the second quarter of 2013 however there are a significant number of substantial equivalence reports for which the fda has not announced decisions at this time it is not possible to predict how long agency reviews of either substantial equivalence reports or new product applications will take 

the fda also published a final regulation in july 2011 establishing a process for requesting an exemption from the substantial equivalence requirements for certain minor modifications to tobacco additives the final rule became effective in august 2011 

   

excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted including with respect to evapor products and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the united states 

federal state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade far outpacing the rate of inflation for example in 2009 the fet on cigarettes increased from 039 per pack to approximately 101 per pack and on july 1 2010 the new york state excise tax increased by 160 to 435 per pack between the end of 1998 and february 21 2014 the weightedaverage state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from 036 to 147 per pack during 2013 massachusetts minnesota oregon and puerto rico enacted 

 

legislation to increase their cigarette taxes as of february 21 2014 no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2014 the president’s fiscal year 2014 budget proposes significant increases in the fet for all tobacco products the proposed budget would increase the fet on a pack of cigarettes by 094 per pack raising the total fet to 195 per pack and would also increase the tax on other tobacco products by a proportionate amount it is not possible to predict whether this proposed fet increase will be enacted 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of the tobacco products of our tobacco subsidiaries through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries 

a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria group inc’s subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 21 2014 the federal government 22 states puerto rico washington dc philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” entered into force in february 2005 as of february 21 2014 177 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the united states is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would among other things establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising marketing promotion and sponsorship initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting implement regulations imposing product testing disclosure and performance standards impose health warning requirements on packaging and adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products including tracking and tracing of tobacco products 

through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products in addition the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” was approved by the conference of parties to the fctc in november 2012 it includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture distribution and sale of tobacco products the protocol has not yet entered into force but in any event will not apply to the united states until the senate ratifies the fctc and until the president signs and the senate ratifies the protocol it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the united states either directly or as a result of the united states becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 18 during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fee payments on altria group inc see financial review  debt and liquidity  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below the state settlement agreements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers’ business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industry’s ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the “stmsa” with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt 

 

various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 

other federal state and local regulation and activity 

 jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors include providence ri new york city ny maine and new jersey whether other states or localities will enact legislation in this area and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted cannot be predicted see fsptca and fda regulation  above for a summary of the fsptca’s regulation of certain tobacco products with characterizing flavors 

 in addition on november 19 2013 new york city enacted an ordinance prohibiting retailers from 1 honoring or accepting any “price reduction instrument” including coupons 2 offering a discount off the listed sales price of a tobacco product to a consumer or 3 offering consumers multipack or multiproduct discounts on the sale of any tobacco product the ordinance also bans sampling of tobacco products in adultonly facilities it also imposes a minimum retail sales price for cigarettes and little cigars and a minimum pack size for certain cigars on january 30 2014 pm usa middleton and a usstc subsidiary along with other tobacco product manufacturers and three trade associations representing new york city retailers filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the southern district of new york challenging the coupondiscount ban on the 

grounds that it violates the first amendment and is preempted by federal and state law 

new york city also enacted an ordinance on november 19 2013 increasing the legal age to purchase tobacco products including electronic cigarettes from 18 to 21 the current federal minimum age requirement for the purchase of tobacco products is 18 four states have increased their state minimum age laws to 19 alabama alaska new jersey and utah and a number of localities have increased their minimum age laws above 18 in addition a number of states have recently proposed increasing the legal age to 21 

 in february 2011 pm usa filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia challenging the usda’s method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the fetra buyout described above pm usa asserted in this litigation that the usda violated fetra and imposed excessive fetra assessments on pm usa by failing to apply the most current fet rates enacted by congress which became effective in april 2009 in calculating the class share allocations the cigar association of america has joined the litigation as a defendant intervenor in october 2012 the district court denied pm usa’s motion for summary judgment granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case in december 2012 pm usa filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit oral argument was held on september 19 2013 on november 20 2013 the fourth circuit affirmed the district court’s decision granting summary judgment 

for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fee payments on altria group inc see financial review  debt and liquidity  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below  we do not anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results in 2013 or 2014 



 

addiction and exposure to ets altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the united states surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products 

reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including in a january 2014 united states surgeon general report titled “the health consequences of smoking  50 years of progress” and in a june 2006 united states surgeon general report on ets titled “the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke” 

many jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places the pace and scope of public smoking bans have increased significantly some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars transporting minors it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes require tax stamping of mst products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful

the state settlement agreements and related legal fee payments payments for tobacco growers and fda user fees as discussed below and in note 18 and item 3 are excluded from the table above as the payments are subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume litigation escrow deposits as discussed below and in note 18 are also excluded from the table above since these deposits will be returned to pm usa should it prevail on appeal 

payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation   as discussed previously and in note 18 and item 3 pm usa has entered into state settlement agreements with the states and territories of the united states pm usa also entered into a trust agreement to provide certain aid to us tobacco growers and quota holders but pm usa’s obligations under this trust expired on december 15 2010 these obligations had been offset by the obligations imposed on pm usa by fetra which expires after the third quarter of 2014 usstc and middleton are also subject to obligations imposed by fetra in addition in june 2009 pm usa and a subsidiary of usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca the state settlement agreements fetra and the fda user fees call for payments that are based on variable factors such as volume market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria group inc’s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales as a result of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees altria group inc’s subsidiaries recorded approximately 44 billion 51 billion and 50 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the 2013 amount included reductions to cost of sales of 664 million related to the npm adjustment items discussed below and under health care cost recovery litigation  possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003  2012 in note 18 

effective december 17 2012 pm usa and the other tobacco product manufacturers that are original signatories the “opms” to the msa as well as certain other participating manufacturers entered into a term sheet with 17 states the district of columbia and puerto rico for settlement of the 2003  2012 npm adjustments with those states and territories in march 2013 the arbitration panel in the npm adjustment arbitration issued a stipulated partial settlement and award the “stipulated award” permitting the term sheet to proceed an additional msa state joined the term sheet in april 2013 prior to the date of pm usa’s april 2013 msa payment based on the identity of the signatory states that had joined the term sheet prior to the date of the april 2013 msa payment the reduction in pm usa’s msa payment obligation was approximately 483 million all of which pm usa received as a credit against its april 2013 msa payment two additional msa states joined the term sheet in may 2013 after the date of pm usa’s april 2013 msa payment and as a result pm usa expects to receive an additional credit of 36 million against its april 2014 msa payment all states and territories that have joined the term sheet are referred to collectively as the “signatory 

 

states” the term sheet also provides that the npm adjustment provision will be revised and streamlined as to the signatory states for years after 2012 in connection with the settlement the formula for allocating among the opms the revised npm adjustments applicable in the future to the signatory states will be modified in a manner favorable to pm usa although the extent to which it is favorable to pm usa will depend upon certain future events including the future relative market shares of the opms 

in september 2013 the arbitration panel presiding over the 2003 npm adjustment dispute ruled that six of 15 states whose 2003 diligent enforcement claims were contested by the participating manufacturers and that had not joined the term sheet did not diligently enforce laws during 2003 that require escrow payments from the cigarette manufacturers that have not signed the msa as a result of this ruling pm usa is entitled to an npm adjustment for 2003 likely in the form of a credit against its april 2014 msa payment in the amount of 145 million plus applicable interest on that amount 

as a result of these npm adjustment items pm usa recorded a reduction to cost of sales of 664 million in 2013 

  as discussed under health care cost recovery litigation  possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003  2012  in note 18 a number of nonsignatory states have taken action in state court to vacate or modify the stipulated award or the diligent enforcement rulings of the arbitration panel no assurance can be given that this litigation will be resolved in a manner favorable to pm usa 

based on current agreements 2013 market share and historical annual industry volume decline rates the estimated amounts that altria group inc’s subsidiaries may charge to cost of sales for payments related to state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees approximate 5 billion in 2014 and approximately 46 billion each year thereafter these amounts reflect the expiration of obligations imposed by fetra after the third quarter of 2014 which will result in a decrease of approximately 100 million in 2014 and approximately 400 million starting in 2015 these amounts exclude the potential impact of the revised and streamlined npm adjustment provision applicable to signatory states for years after 2012 discussed above and also exclude the adjustments described below 

the estimated amounts due under the state settlement agreements and fetra charged to cost of sales in each year would generally be paid in the following year the amounts charged to cost of sales for fda user fees are generally paid in the quarter in which the fees are incurred as previously stated the payments due under the terms of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees are subject to adjustment for several factors including volume inflation and certain contingent events and in general are allocated based on each manufacturer’s market share the future payment amounts above are estimates and actual payment amounts will differ to the extent underlying assumptions differ from actual future results 

litigation escrow deposits   with respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals as of december 31 2013  pm usa had posted various forms of security totaling 

approximately 27 million the majority of which have been collateralized with cash deposits these cash deposits are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 

although litigation is subject to uncertainty and an adverse outcome or settlement of litigation could have a material adverse effect on the financial position cash flows or results of operations of pm usa ust or altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year as more fully disclosed in note 18 item 3 and item 1a management expects cash flow from operations together with altria group inc’s access to capital markets to provide sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing business needs

dividends paid in 2013  and 2012  were approximately 36 billion  and 34 billion respectively an increase of 62  primarily reflecting a higher dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased by altria group inc under its share repurchase programs discussed below

at december 31 2013 altria group inc had approximately 457 million  remaining in the april 2013 share repurchase program which it expects to complete by the end of the third quarter of 2014  the timing of share repurchases under the april 2013 share repurchase program depends upon marketplace conditions and other factors and remains subject to the discretion of the board of directors

▪ distribution competition and raw materials   altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services 

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts including coupons product promotions and allowances for new products 

in june 2009 the president signed into law the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act fsptca which provides the united states food and drug administration fda with broad authority to regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products the authority to require disclosures of related information and the authority to enforce the fsptca and related regulations the law also grants the fda authority to extend its application by regulation to other tobacco products including cigars the fsptca imposes significant new restrictions on the sale advertising and promotion of tobacco products pm usa and a subsidiary of usstc are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of this legislation and the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product pm usa usstc and other us tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

in the united states under a contract growing program pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers under the terms of this program pm usa agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts pm usa also purchases a portion of its united states tobacco requirements 

through leaf merchants in 2003 pm usa and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quotaholders the agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant including pm usa to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from us tobacco growers over a period of at least 10 years these quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement 

tobacco production in the united states was historically subject to government controls including the production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the usda in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 fetra was signed into law pm usa usstc and middleton are all subject to obligations imposed by fetra fetra eliminated the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout is approximately 95 billion and is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product as a result of fetra altria group incs subsidiaries recorded approximately 04 billion of charges to cost of sales during each of the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

in february 2011 pm usa filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the usdas method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the fetra buyout described above and used by the fda to calculate the industrys fda user fees pm usa asserts in this litigation that the usda violated fetra and its own regulations by failing to apply the most current federal excise tax fet rates enacted by congress which became effective in april 2009 in calculating the class share allocations pm usa has filed administrative appeals of its fetra assessments beginning in fiscal year 2011 all of which have been denied by the usda and has submitted a petition for rulemaking with the usda which petition was denied by the usda in november 2011 in each case asserting that the usda erroneously failed to base the fetra class share allocations on the current fet rates pm usa is appealing the usdas calculations methodology as well as the denial of the petition for rulemaking and the denial of its quarterly assessment challenges the cigar association of america has joined the litigation as a defendant intervenor in october 2012 the district court dismissed the case over pm usas objection and the matter is now on appeal 

the quota buyout did not have a material impact on altria group incs 2012  consolidated results and altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2013 and 2014 when the obligations imposed by fetra will expire

growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants 

middleton purchases burley and dark aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf merchants middleton does not have a contract growing program 

altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements

▪ distribution competition and raw materials   key elements of ste michelles strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines especially in certain account categories such as restaurants wholesale clubs supermarkets wine shops and mass merchandisers and a focus on improving product mix to higherpriced premium products 

ste michelles business is subject to significant competition including competition from many larger wellestablished domestic and international companies as well as from many smaller wine producers wine segment competition is primarily based on quality price consumer and trade wine tastings competitive wine judging thirdparty acclaim and advertising substantially all of ste michelles sales occur through statelicensed distributors 

federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelles wine business 

ste michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production at the present time ste michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to security holders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as strategy expects continues plans anticipates believes will estimates forecasts intends projects goals objectives guidance targets and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group incs securities in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the business environment sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries businesses in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k item 7 you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

tobaccorelated litigation 

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending 

 

or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims may be raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contraband shipments patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts 

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 45 states and puerto rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 18 contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 note 18 tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of floridas bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

 

this section uses the terms we our and us when it is not necessary to distinguish among altria group inc and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

in certain litigation pm usa faces potentially significant nonmonetary remedies for example in the lawsuit brought by the united states department of justice discussed in note 18 the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant nonmonetary remedies including the issuance of corrective statements in various media 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k note 18 and exhibits 991 and 992 to this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

tobacco regulation and control action in the public and private sectors 

our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use restricting marketing and advertising imposing regulations on packaging warnings and disclosure of flavors or other ingredients prohibiting the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors or other characteristics premarket authorization of certain tobacco products limiting or prohibiting the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes and seeking to hold them responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 

pm usa usstc and other altria group inc subsidiaries are subject to regulation and may become subject to additional regulation by the fda as discussed in detail in tobacco space  business environment  fsptca and fda regulation in   item 7 we cannot predict how the fda will implement and enforce its statutory authority including by promulgating additional regulations and pursuing possible investigatory or enforcement actions 

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels actions by the fda or other federal state or local governments or agencies may impact the consumer acceptability 

 

of tobacco products limit adult consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products restrict communications to adult consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements require the recall or removal of tobacco products from the marketplace or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business all or any of which may have a material adverse impact on the business consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our tobacco products due to lower consumption levels and to a potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an adverse impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see  tobacco space  business environment  excise taxes  in item 7  

increased competition in the united states tobacco categories 

each of altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states among other factors have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category both from existing competitors and new entrants and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands in the cigar category additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machinemade large cigars manufactured offshore 

new product technologies 

altria group incs subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and potentially outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences potential solutions being researched include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful these efforts may include arrangements with third parties moreover these efforts may not succeed if our subsidiaries do not succeed in their efforts but one or more of their competitors does our subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of such products with claims of reduced risk to consumers or otherwise impose an unduly burdensome regulatory framework on such products or whether consumers purchase decisions would be affected by such claims which could adversely affect the commercial viability of any such products that might be developed 

adjacency growth strategy 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful for a related discussion see new product technologies  above 

tobacco price availability and quality 

any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries profitability and business for a discussion of factors that influence leaf prices availability and quality see  tobacco space  business environment  tobacco price availability and quality in item 7    

tobacco key facilities supply security 

altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing facilities of any of altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries or the facilities of any significant suppliers of any of altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more altria group inc subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business the consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position of altria group inc 

attracting and retaining talent 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining 

 

the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

competition evolving consumer preferences and economic downturns 

each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and changes in economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

▪ promote brand equity successfully 

▪ anticipate and respond to new and evolving consumer preferences 

▪ develop new products and markets within and potentially outside of the united states and broaden brand portfolios in order to compete effectively with lowerpriced products 

▪ improve productivity and 

▪ protect or enhance margins through cost savings and price increases 

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products the results of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if parties to pmccs leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

acquisitions 

altria group inc from time to time considers acquisitions from time to time we may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

capital markets 

access to the capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the capital markets and any resulting tightening of credit availability pricing andor credit terms may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

exchange rates 

for purposes of financial reporting the earnings of sabmiller are translated into us dollars from various local currencies based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported equity earnings in sabmiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer us dollars 

asset impairment 

we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings for further discussion see critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7    

wine  competition grape supply regulation and excise taxes 

ste michelles business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies the adequacy of ste michelles grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelles sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelles wine business for further discussion see wine segment  business environment in item 7  

information systems 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees investors suppliers customers and others many of these 

 

information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data cause damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands and result in legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group inc and its subsidiaries 

governmental investigations 

from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations and it is possible that our subsidiaries businesses could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations

altria group incs chief operating decision maker has been evaluating the operating results of the former cigarettes and cigars segments as a single smokeable products segment since january 1 2012 the combination of these two formerly separate segments is related to the restructuring associated with the cost reduction program announced in october 2011 the 2011 cost reduction program also in connection with the 2011 cost reduction program effective january 1 2012 middleton became a whollyowned subsidiary of pm usa reflecting managements goal to achieve efficiencies in the management of these businesses effective with the first quarter of 2012 and at december 31 2012 altria group incs reportable segments were smokeable products smokeless products wine and financial services as a result of the revised reportable segments and middleton becoming a whollyowned subsidiary of pm usa certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with

executive summary 

the following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated results of operations 

the changes in altria group incs net earnings and diluted earnings per share eps attributable to altria group inc for the year ended december 31 2012  from the year ended december 31 2011  were due primarily to the following

 ▪ higher income from all reportable segments 

▪ higher equity earnings from sabmiller and 

▪ lower interest and other debt expense net 

for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis 

2013 forecasted results 

while there are signs of modest improvement in certain economic indicators altria group inc remains cautious about the 2013 business environment adult consumers remain under economic pressure as they face the end of the payroll tax holiday as well as continuing high unemployment with a number of states facing budget shortfalls tobacco products will remain a target for excise tax increases 

in january 2013 altria group inc forecasted that its 2013 fullyear reported diluted eps is expected to be in the range of 234 to 240 this forecast includes estimated expenses of 001 per share as detailed in the table below as compared with 2012 fullyear reported diluted eps of 206 which included 015 per share of net expenses as detailed in the table below expected 2013 fullyear adjusted diluted eps which excludes the expenses in the table below represents a growth rate of 6 to 9 over 2012 fullyear adjusted diluted eps the 2013 fullyear forecast does not reflect the potential impact of pm usas agreement to resolve the nonparticipating manufacturer npm adjustment disputes discussed in note 18 contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 note 18 

the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast 

expense income net included in reported diluted eps

the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates the revisions are included in altria group incs consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between altria group incs estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group incs consolidated financial statements 

▪ consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include altria group inc as well as its whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries investments in which altria 

group inc exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 

▪ revenue recognition   the consumer products businesses recognize revenues net of sales incentives and sales returns and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers upon shipment or delivery of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized altria group incs consumer products businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales 

▪ depreciation amortization impairment testing and asset valuation altria group inc depreciates property plant and equipment and amortizes its definitelived intangible assets using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years 

altria group inc reviews longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable altria group inc performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use altria group inc groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal altria group inc also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of longlived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets recorded by altria group inc at december 31 2012  relate primarily to the acquisitions of ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007 as required by us gaap altria group inc conducts an annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for potential impairment and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group inc to perform an interim review 

goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of each reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is considered impaired the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill which is determined using discounted cash flows impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset if the carrying value 

 

exceeds fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets by reporting unit at december 31 2012  were as follows 



during 2012  2011  and 2010  altria group inc completed its annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and no impairment charges resulted from these reviews 

at december 31 2012  the estimated fair values of the smokeless products and wine reporting units as well as the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets within those reporting units except for certain smokeless products trademarks primarily red seal  and husky  substantially exceeded their carrying values 

at december 31 2012  the estimated fair value of the cigars reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 13 in addition the carrying value and excess fair value over carrying value for the indefinitelived intangible assets of certain smokeless products and cigars trademarks were as follows 



 in the smokeless products reporting unit 2012 results for certain smokeless products trademarks primarily red seal  and husky  continued to be impacted by lower levels of promotional support on these brands and increased competitive activity in the discount category due to growth in premium category products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price this specific marketplace dynamic continued to negatively impact discounted cash flows when conducting the 2012  annual review of indefinitelived intangible assets in the cigars reporting unit middleton continues to observe significant competitive activity including higher levels of imported lowpriced machinemade large cigars as a result management concluded after the 2012 review that while the fair values for certain smokeless products and cigars trademarks exceeded their respective carrying values as indicated above they do not substantially exceed their carrying values 

in 2012 altria group inc utilized an income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units and its indefinitelived intangible assets the income approach reflects the 

discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the riskfree rate for the use of those funds the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows the average discount rate utilized in performing the valuations was 10 

in performing the 2012 discounted cash flow analysis altria group inc made various judgments estimates and assumptions the most significant of which were volume income growth rates and discount rates the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group incs longterm financial forecast and also included market participant assumptions regarding the highest and best use of altria group incs indefinitelived intangible assets assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the longterm financial forecast fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group incs control 

although altria group incs discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and therefore altria group incs impairment conclusions general economic conditions federal state and local regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes 

while altria group incs management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are reasonable actual performance in the shortterm or longterm could be significantly different from forecasted performance which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets see note 3 goodwill and other intangible assets net  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

▪ marketing costs   altria group incs consumer products businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs consumer incentives and trade promotions such programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives event marketing and volumebased incentives consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

 

▪ contingencies   as discussed in note 18 and item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k item 3 legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees in 1998 pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the msa with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the state settlement agreements pm usas portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due pm usa also entered into a trust agreement to provide certain aid to us tobacco growers and quota holders but pm usas obligations under this trust expired on december 15 2010 these obligations had been offset by the obligations imposed on pm usa by the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 fetra which expires in the third quarter of 2014 usstc and middleton are also subject to obligations imposed by fetra in addition in june 2009 pm usa and a subsidiary of usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the united states food and drug administration fda as a result of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act fsptca the state settlement agreements fetra and the fda user fees call for payments that are based on variable factors such as volume market share and inflation depending on the subject payment altria group incs subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales as a result of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fees altria group incs subsidiaries recorded approximately 51 billion 50 billion and 50 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively see note 18 for a discussion of the potential impact of pm usas agreement to resolve the npm adjustment disputes 

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated except to the extent discussed in note 18 and item 3 at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any 

amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings 

▪ employee benefit plans   as discussed in note 16 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 note 16 altria group inc provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance altria group inc records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates altria group inc reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 

altria group inc recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses net of tax the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 

at december 31 2012  altria group incs discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans decreased to 40 and 39 respectively from 50 and 49 respectively at december 31 2011  altria group inc presently anticipates a decrease of approximately 18 million in its 2013 pretax pension and postretirement expense not including amounts in each year related to termination settlement and curtailment this anticipated decrease is due primarily to higher expected return on pension plan assets due to the higher value of plan assets at december 31 2012 and the impact of a 350 million voluntary pension plan contribution made in january 2013 partially offset by the impact of the discount rate changes a 50 basis point decrease increase in altria group incs discount rates would increase decrease altria group incs pension and postretirement expense by approximately 39 million similarly a 50 basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria group incs pension expense by approximately 29 million see note 16 for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

▪ income taxes   altria group incs deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

 

altria group inc recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

altria group inc recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of earnings 

as discussed in note 14 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 note 14 altria group inc recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2012  2011  and 2010  as a result of various tax events 

▪ leasing   substantially all of pmccs net revenues in 2012  related to income on leveraged leases and related gains on asset sales income relating to leveraged leases is recorded initially as unearned income which is included in the line item finance assets net on altria group incs consolidated balance sheets and is subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant aftertax rates of return on the positive net investment balances as discussed in note 7 finance assets net  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 note 7 pmcc lessees are affected by bankruptcy filings credit rating changes and financial market conditions 

pmccs investment in leases is included in the line item finance assets net on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2012  and 2011  at december 31 2012  pmccs net finance receivables of approximately 25 billion in leveraged leases which are included in finance assets net on altria group incs consolidated balance sheet consisted of rents receivable 63 billion and the residual value of assets under lease 11 billion reduced by thirdparty nonrecourse debt 39 billion and unearned income 10 billion the repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to the general assets of pmcc as required by us gaap the thirdparty nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rents receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net on altria group incs consolidated balance sheets finance assets net at december 31 2012  also included net finance receivables for direct finance leases 02 billion and an allowance for losses 01 billion 

estimated residual values represent pmccs estimate at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the noncancelable lease terms the estimated residual values are reviewed annually by pmccs management which includes analysis of a number of factors including activity in the relevant industry if necessary revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values such reviews resulted in a decrease of 8 million in 2012 and 11 million in 2010 to pmcc’s net revenues and results of operations there were no adjustments in 2011 

pmcc considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date pmcc 

stops recording income nonaccrual status on rents receivable when contractual payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain payments received on rents receivable that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance writeoffs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible there were no rents receivable on nonaccrual status at december 31 2012  

to the extent that rents receivable due to pmcc may be uncollectible pmcc records an allowance for losses against its finance assets losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable pmcc regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur pmcc considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses for further discussion see note 7

operating results by business segment 

tobacco space 

business environment 

summary 

the united states tobacco industry faces a number of business and legal challenges that have adversely affected and may adversely affect the business and sales volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges some of which are discussed in more detail below and in note 18 item 1a and item 3 include 

▪ pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements as discussed in note 18 and item 3 

▪ restrictions and requirements imposed by the fsptca enacted in june 2009 and restrictions and requirements that have been and in the future may be imposed by the fda under this statute 

▪ actual and proposed excise tax increases as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements 

▪ bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers 

▪ other federal state and local government actions including 

▪ restrictions on the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes 

▪ additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products 

▪ other actual and proposed tobacco product legislation and regulation and 

▪ governmental investigations 

▪ the diminishing prevalence of cigarette smoking and increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and others including employers to further restrict tobacco use 

▪ price gaps and changes in price gaps between premium and lowest price brands 

▪ competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation 

▪ illicit trade practices including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products by third parties the sale of tobacco products by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes diversion into one market of products intended for sale in another the potential assertion of claims and other issues relating to contraband shipments of tobacco products and the 

imposition of additional legislative or regulatory requirements related to illicit trade practices and 

▪ potential adverse changes in tobacco leaf price availability and quality 

in addition to and in connection with the foregoing business and legal challenges our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories or use multiple forms of tobacco products and that approximately 30 of adult smokers are interested in spitfree smokeless tobacco alternatives to cigarettes future success is dependent in part on the ability of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences by developing over time new products and markets within and potentially outside the united states through technological innovation including where appropriate arrangements with third parties and pursuit of their adjacency growth strategies see item 1a for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion 

we have provided additional detail on the following topics below 

 fsptca and fda regulation 

▪ the regulatory framework the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our cigarette and smokeless tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action under the fsptca the fda has broad authority to regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products the authority to require disclosures of related information and the authority to enforce the fsptca and related regulations the law also grants the fda authority to extend its application by regulation to other tobacco products including cigars the fda has indicated that it intends to regulate cigars and other tobacco products but it has not indicated a timeline for the issuance of regulations 

among other measures the fsptca 

▪ imposes restrictions on the advertising promotion sale and distribution of tobacco products including at retail 

▪ prohibits cigarettes with characterizing flavors other than menthol and tobacco 

 

▪ bans descriptors such as light mild or low or similar descriptors unless expressly authorized by the fda 

▪ requires extensive ingredient disclosure to the fda and may require more limited public ingredient disclosure 

▪ prohibits any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without fda authorization 

▪ imposes reporting obligations relating to contraband activity and grants the fda authority to impose other recordkeeping and reporting obligations to address counterfeit and contraband products 

▪ changes the language of the cigarette and smokeless tobacco product health warnings enlarges their size and requires the development by the fda of graphic warnings for cigarettes which it published in june 2011 and gives the fda the authority to require new warnings 

▪ authorizes the fda to adopt product regulations and related actions including 

▪ to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health through a regulatory process including among other possibilities restrictions on ingredients constituents or other properties performance or design criteria as well as to impose testing measurement reporting and disclosure requirements 

▪ to subject tobacco products that are modified or first introduced into the market after march 22 2011 to application and premarket review and authorization requirements the new product application process if the fda does not find them to be substantially equivalent to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 and to deny any such new product application thus preventing the distribution and sale of any product affected by such denial 

▪ to determine that certain existing tobacco products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between february 15 2007 and march 22 2011 are not substantially equivalent to products commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 in which case the fda could require the removal of such products or subject them to the new product application process and if any such applications are denied prevent the continued distribution and sale of such products see fda regulatory actions  below 

▪ to restrict or otherwise regulate menthol cigarettes as well as other tobacco products with characterizing flavors 

▪ to regulate nicotine yields and to reduce or eliminate harmful constituents or harmful ingredients or other components of tobacco products and 

▪ to impose manufacturing standards for tobacco products and 

▪ equips the fda with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools including the authority to inspect tobacco product manufacturing and other facilities 

▪ implementation timing rulemaking and guidance the implementation of the fsptca began in 2009 and will continue over time some provisions took effect immediately some provisions have taken effect since the enactment of the fsptca and other provisions will not take effect for some time those provisions that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and for some issues scientific review altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries are participating actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement its regulatory framework including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 

from time to time the fda also issues guidance for public comment which may be issued in draft or final form such guidance when finalized is intended to represent the fdas current thinking on a particular topic and may be predictive of the fdas enforcement stance on that topic such guidance even when finalized is not intended to bind the fda or the public or establish legally enforceable responsibilities examples of current draft guidance include 

▪ draft guidance for industry and fda staff demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions 

▪ draft guidance for industry modified risk tobacco product applications 

▪ draft guidance for industry applications for premarket review of new tobacco products 

a complete set of guidance documents issued by the fda can be found on the fdas website at wwwfdagovtobaccoproductsguidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation the information on this website is not and shall not be deemed to be part of this report or incorporated into any other filings altria group inc makes with the securities and exchange commission sec 

pm usa and usstc submit comments to the fda on draft or final guidance when appropriate in some cases pm usa and usstc may disagree with a particular interpretation by the fda as expressed in draft or final guidance and may communicate their position in writing to the fda for example pm usa and usstc communicated disagreement with fda interpretations of the statute set forth in the draft guidance for industry and fda staff demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions regarding when a manufacturer must submit substantial equivalence reports while pm usa and usstc believe that all of their current products meet the statutory requirements of the fsptca they cannot predict whether when or how the fda ultimately will apply its guidance or seek to enforce the law and regulations consistent with its guidance as discussed below in investigations and enforcement  fda enforcement actions could 

 

have a material adverse effect on the business financial position cash flows and results of operations of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states territories and localities of the united states of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements  below such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states territories and localities 

▪ impact on our business compliance costs regulations imposed by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse impact on the business and sales volume of altria group incs tobacco businesses in a number of different ways for example actions by the fda could 

▪ impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products 

▪ delay or prevent the sale or distribution of existing new or modified tobacco products 

▪ limit adult consumer choices 

▪ restrict communications to adult consumers 

▪ create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies 

▪ impose additional manufacturing labeling or packaging requirements 

 the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements even inadvertently and fda enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on the business financial position cash flows and results of operations of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

the law imposes fees on tobacco product manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation according to a process set out in the statute and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective class based on their relative market shares for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fee payments on altria group inc see offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligationspayments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below in addition compliance with the laws regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter to date but could become substantial either individually or in the aggregate and will depend on the nature of the requirements imposed by the fda 

▪ investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it including document requests and other required information submissions facility inspections examinations and investigations injunction proceedings money penalties product withdrawals and recalls and product seizures the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of altria group inc or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business financial position cash flows and results of operations of altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 

for example in june 2010 the fda issued a document request regarding changes to marlboro gold pack cigarette packaging in connection with the fsptcas ban of certain descriptors pm usa submitted documents in response to the fdas request 



 

these engagements in february 2011 lorillard tobacco company and rj reynolds tobacco company filed suit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the united states department of health and human services and individual defendants sued in their official capacities asserting that the composition of the tpsac and the composition of the constituents subcommittee of the tpsac violates several federal laws including the federal advisory committee act in august 2012 the district court denied the governments motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint 

▪ tpsac action on menthol as mandated by the fsptca in march 2011 the tpsac submitted to the fda a report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health and related recommendations the tpsac report stated that menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health in the united states the tpsac report recommended that the removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the united states the tpsac report noted the potential that any ban on menthol cigarettes could lead to an increase in contraband cigarettes and other potential unintended consequences and suggested that the fda consult with appropriate experts on this matter the tpsac report also recommended that additional research could address gaps in understanding menthol cigarettes 

in march 2011 pm usa submitted a report to the fda outlining its position that neither science nor other evidence demonstrates that regulatory actions or restrictions related to the use of menthol cigarettes are warranted the report noted pm usas belief that significant restrictions on the use of menthol cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society 

in july 2011 the tpsac revised and approved its march 2011 report the revisions were editorial in nature and did not change the substantive conclusions and recommendations of the tpsac 

the fsptca does not set a deadline or required timeline for the fda to act on the tpsac report the fda has stated that the tpsac report is only a recommendation and that the fdas receipt of the tpsacs report will not have an immediate effect on the availability of menthol cigarettes in january 2012 the fda announced that it had evaluated scientific information on menthol and had drafted a report related to the impact of menthol in cigarettes on public health the fda indicated that it had sent its report to external scientists for peer review it also indicated that it will make its final draft report and related information available for public comment although it has not yet done so any future action taken by the fda to regulate the manufacture marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes including a possible ban will require formal rulemaking that includes public notice and the opportunity for public comment 

▪ final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca the fda repromulgated in march 2010 certain advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in 1996 but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the final tobacco marketing rule the final tobacco marketing rule 

▪ bans the use of color and graphics in tobacco product labeling and advertising 

▪ prohibits the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to underage persons 

▪ restricts the use of nontobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products 

▪ requires the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in direct facetoface transactions 

▪ prohibits sampling of cigarettes and prohibits sampling of smokeless tobacco products except in qualified adultonly facilities 

▪ prohibits gifts or other items in exchange for buying cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products 

▪ prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with tobacco brands or logos and 

▪ prohibits brand name sponsorship of any athletic musical artistic or other social or cultural event or any entry or team in any event 

subject to the limitations described below the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june 2010 at the time of the repromulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the socalled 1000 foot rule which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds pm usa and usstc submitted comments on this advance notice 

since enactment several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the fsptca and the final tobacco marketing rule including their constitutionality and the scope of the fdas authority thereunder altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries are not parties to any of these lawsuits in january 2010 in one such challenge  commonwealth brands  the united states district court for the western district of kentucky struck down as unconstitutional and enjoined enforcement of the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising and claims implying that a tobacco product is safer because of fda regulation the parties appealed and in march 2012 the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district courts decision the sixth circuit affirmed the district courts injunction against enforcement of the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising the sixth circuit reversed the injunction against enforcement of the 

 

prohibition on claims implying that a tobacco product is safer because of fda regulation the sixth circuit also held that the final tobacco marketing rules ban on consumer continuity programs violates the first amendment and reversed the district courts decision upholding the ban the sixth circuit upheld the fsptcas statutory requirements for enlarged textual and graphic warnings on cigarette packages and advertising but did not rule upon the constitutionality of the nine graphic warnings actually selected by the fda in its june 2011 final rule in may 2012 the plaintiffs in commonwealth brands filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc  which the sixth circuit denied in october 2012 the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari  in the united states supreme court seeking further review of the sixth circuits decision upholding the fsptcas new enlarged and expanded warning requirements that include graphic warnings the fsptcas restrictions on modified risk tobacco product claims and certain other provisions of the final tobacco marketing rule the fda did not file a petition for writ of certiorari     with the united states supreme court seeking further review of the sixth circuits decision for a further discussion of this final rule and the challenge pending in the united states district court for the district of columbia see fda regulatory actionsgraphics warnings  below the fda has indicated that it does not intend to enforce the ban on the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising for the duration of the injunction 

in a separate challenge to the final tobacco marketing rule in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia renegade tobacco company inc and others have challenged the constitutionality of an fda regulation that restricts tobacco manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a nontobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products in may 2010 the court issued a stay in the renegade case pending the fdas consideration of amendments to the trade or brand name rule in november 2011 the fda proposed an amended rule but continues to exercise its discretion to enforce the original trade or brand name provisions of the final tobacco marketing rule according to fda guidance issued in may 2010 it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such litigation or its effect on the extent of the fdas authority to regulate tobacco products 

▪ contraband the fsptca imposes on manufacturers reporting obligations relating to knowledge of suspected contraband activity involving their brands and also grants the fda the authority to impose certain other recordkeeping and reporting obligations to address counterfeit and contraband tobacco products the fsptca also empowers the fda to assess whether additional tools should be employed to track and trace tobacco products through the distribution chain 



consist of nine new textual warning statements accompanied by color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking the graphic health warnings will i be located beneath the cellophane and comprise the top 50 percent of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and ii occupy 20 percent of a cigarette advertisement and be located at the top of the advertisement 

the rule requires that cigarette packaging manufactured after september 22 2012 contain the new graphic warnings and all cigarette advertising contain the new warnings by that date in august 2011 however rj reynolds tobacco company lorillard tobacco company and several other plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against the fda challenging its graphic warnings rule in november 2011 the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction thereby staying enforcement of the graphic warnings rule until 15 months after a final ruling from the district court in february 2012 the district court entered final judgment on behalf of the plaintiffs enjoining enforcement of the graphic warnings rule the fda appealed this decision to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in august 2012 the court of appeals affirmed the ruling of the district court the fda filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc  with the court of appeals which was denied on december 5 2012 

pm usa is not a party to this lawsuit but the fda has confirmed that it will not enforce the graphic warnings rule against pm usa on the same terms and with the same effect as the district court injunction discussed above 



 

manufacturers intending to introduce new products and certain modified products into the market after march 22 2011 must submit a report to the fda and obtain a substantial equivalence order from the agency before introducing the products into the market if the fda declines to issue a socalled substantial equivalence order for a product or if the manufacturer itself determines that the product does not meet the substantial equivalence requirements the product would need to undergo the new product application process at this time it is not possible to predict how long agency reviews of either substantial equivalence reports or new product applications will take 

the fda also published a final regulation in july 2011 establishing a process for requesting an exemption from the substantial equivalence requirements for certain minor modifications to tobacco additives the final rule became effective in august 2011 

excise taxes 

tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states significant increases in tobaccorelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal state and local levels within the united states 

federal state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade far outpacing the rate of inflation for example in 2009 the federal excise tax fet on cigarettes increased from 39 cents per pack to approximately 101 per pack and on july 1 2010 the new york state excise tax increased by 160 to 435 per pack between the end of 1998 and february 22 2013 the weightedaverage state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from 036 to 141 per pack during 2012 two states illinois and rhode island enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise tax as of february 22 2013 no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in 2013 

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of tobacco products by our tobacco subsidiaries due to lower consumption levels and to a potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries 

a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product typically the wholesale price this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lowerpriced products of equal weight altria group incs subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weightbased methodology because unlike the ad valorem tax a weightbased tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax as of february 22 2013 22 states washington dc philadelphia pennsylvania and cook county illinois have adopted a weightbased tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

international treaty on tobacco control 

the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control  the fctc entered into force in february 2005 as of february 22 2013 176 countries as well as the european community have become parties to the fctc while the united states is a signatory of the fctc it is not currently a party to the agreement as the agreement has not been submitted to or ratified by the united states senate the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation the treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would among other things establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising marketing promotion and sponsorship initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting implement regulations imposing product testing disclosure and performance standards impose health warning requirements on packaging and adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places 

there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture marketing distribution and sale of tobacco products in addition the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the protocol was approved by the conference of parties to the fctc on november 12 2012 it includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture distribution and sale of tobacco products the protocol has not yet entered into force but in any event will not apply to the united states until the senate ratifies the fctc it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the united states either directly as a result of the united states becoming a party to the fctc or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 

state settlement agreements 

as discussed in note 18 during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into agreements with states and various united states jurisdictions settling asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims collectively the state settlement agreements these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments which are adjusted for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fee payments on altria 

 

group inc see off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below the settlements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers business operations including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising payments for product placement and free sampling except in adultonly facilities restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name nontobacco products the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters in addition the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes impose requirements regarding lobbying activities mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents limit the industrys ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws and provide for the dissolution of certain tobaccorelated organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 

in november 1998 usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the stmsa with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 

other federal state and local regulation and activity 

 to date the following states have enacted legislation that prohibits certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors 

maine  enacted legislation that prohibits the sale of certain flavored cigar and cigarette products as implemented including the application of certain statutory exemptions this prohibition did not ban any pm usa usstc or middleton product in 2010 maine amended the characterizing flavor prohibition the amendment allows the continued sale of cigars that obtained favorable exemption rulings under the previous statute but does not provide for the possibility of further exemptions such as for future products with characterizing flavors 

new jersey enacted legislation banning the sale and marketing of cigarettes with a characterizing flavor other than menthol mint or clove this legislation does not ban any pm usa usstc or middleton product 

in addition such legislation has been enacted or is being considered in a number of localities for example 

new york city  adopted an ordinance that prohibits the sale of certain flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes this legislation affects certain usstc and middleton products the ordinance and related final regulations took effect in august 2010 certain subsidiaries of usstc have filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york challenging the new york city legislation on the grounds that it is preempted by the fsptca in march 2010 the district court denied plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ordinance and in november 2011 the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted new york citys crossmotion for summary judgment on the preemption claim plaintiffs have appealed the denial to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit and in the meantime are complying with the ordinance pending resolution of the litigation argument was heard on november 6 2012 on february 26 2013 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court upholding the new york city ordinance 

providence rhode island adopted two ordinances in january 2012 one would prohibit the sale in most retail outlets of certain flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes this legislation differs in a number of ways from the new york city ordinance including by attempting to prohibit reference to concepts such as spicy arctic ice cool warm hot mellow fresh and breeze the second providence ordinance prohibits licensed retailers in the city from accepting or redeeming coupons for cigarettes and other tobacco products or from selling such products to consumers through multipack discounts or other discounts provided in exchange for the purchase of another tobacco product in february 2012 altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries filed a legal challenge to these ordinances in the united states district court for the district of rhode island challenging the legality of both ordinances on preemption and first amendment grounds plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction and summary judgment in march 2012 the city of providence filed a crossmotion for summary judgment in june 2012 on december 10 2012 the district court struck the concepts language quoted above from the flavor ordinance but otherwise granted summary judgment for the city of providence as to both ordinances the city of providence commenced enforcement of the ordinances as modified by the district court on january 3 2013 on january 8 2013 plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the first circuit 

 

whether other states or localities will enact legislation in this area and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted cannot be predicted see fda regulation  above for a summary of the fsptcas regulation of certain tobacco products with characterizing flavors 

 as another example the village board of haverstraw new york enacted a tobacco product display ban in april 2012 it would have barred tobacco retailers from  displaying  any tobacco product in a manner that a consumer could view the product prior to purchase retailers could maintain a tobacco menu listing the types and prices of tobacco products available for sale but the menu could only be given to a consumer over the legal age to purchase tobacco products who requested it at all other times any tobacco menu would have been concealed from view in june 2012 an association of tobacco retailers along with several tobacco product manufacturers and distributors including pm usa a subsidiary of usstc and middleton filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york challenging the display ban on first amendment and preemption grounds in july 2012 the village board voted to approve a settlement of the lawsuit and in august 2012 voted to repeal the ordinance this litigation has concluded 

 in february 2011 pm usa filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia challenging the united states department of agricultures the usda method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the fetra buyout described above and are used by the fda to calculate the 

industrys fda user fees pm usa asserted in this litigation that the usda violated fetra and imposed excessive fetra assessments on pm usa by failing to apply the most current fet rates enacted by congress which became effective in april 2009 in calculating the class share allocations the cigar association of america has joined the litigation as a defendant intervenor in october 2012 the district court denied pm usas motion for summary judgment granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case on december 5 2012 pm usa filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit 

for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements fetra and fda user fee payments on altria group inc see off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements and fda regulation below  we do not anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results in 2013 and 2014 

 reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years including in a june 2006 united states surgeon general report on ets entitled the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke many jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places the pace and scope of public smoking bans have increased significantly some public health groups have called for and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places in private apartments and in cars with minors in them it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 

▪ other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions for example in recent years legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs or provide 

 

additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes require tax stamping of moist smokeless tobacco products require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology and further restrict the sale marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds which may or may not be successful 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and if challenged upheld relating to the manufacturing design packaging marketing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented in the united states that might materially adversely affect the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 

▪ governmental investigations from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters altria group inc and its subsidiaries cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced 

illicit trade 

altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries support appropriate regulations and enforcement measures to prevent illicit trade in tobacco products for example altria group incs tobacco subsidiaries are engaged in a number of initiatives to help prevent trade in contraband tobacco products including enforcement of wholesale and retail trade programs and policies on trade in contraband tobacco products engagement with and support of law enforcement and regulatory agencies litigation to protect their trademarks and support for a variety of federal and state legislative initiatives legislative initiatives to address trade in contraband tobacco products are designed to protect the legitimate channels of distribution impose more stringent penalties for the violation of illegal trade laws and provide additional tools for law enforcement regulatory measures and related governmental actions to prevent the illicit manufacture and trade of tobacco products continue to evolve as the nature of illicit tobacco products evolves for example in march 2010 the president signed into law the prevent all cigarette trafficking pact act which addresses illegal internet sales by among other things imposing a series of restrictions and requirements on the deliverysale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and makes such products nonmailable to consumers through the united states postal service subject to limited exceptions certain internet cigarette sellers filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of various aspects of this statute and sought injunctive relief in the united states district courts for the district of columbia the western district of new york and the eastern district of pennsylvania in the western district of new york the district court enjoined only certain elements of the 

pact act including a requirement that deliverysellers obey the laws of the jurisdiction to which they ship cigarettes in the district of columbia the district court issued a preliminary injunction substantially similar to the injunctive relief issued in the western district of new york the united states department of justice is challenging the district of columbia injunction on appeal and is pursuing a final judgment on the merits in the western district of new york proceedings 

tobacco price availability and quality 

shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns government mandated prices and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the quality of tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products as with other agriculture commodities the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could cause tobacco leaf prices to increase and could result in farmers growing less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could affect our tobacco subsidiaries profitability and business 

timing of sales 

in the ordinary course of business our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events the timing of promotions customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and taxdriven price increases 

tobacco space 

operating results 

the following table summarizes tobacco space operating results 

smokeable products segment 

the smokeable products segments operating companies income and margin grew during 2012  primarily through higher 

 

pricing and effective cost management pm usa continued to support marlboro s new brand architecture with brandbuilding initiatives which contributed to marlboro s 2012 retail share gains 

the following table summarizes smokeable products segment shipment volume performance 



cigarettes shipment volume includes marlboro  other premium brands such as virginia slims  parliament  and benson  hedges  and discount brands which include basic  and lm cigarettes volume includes units sold as well as promotional units but excludes units sold in puerto rico and us territories to overseas military and by philip morris duty free inc none of which individually or in the aggregate is material to the smokeable products segment 

the following table summarizes the smokeable products segment retail share performance 



cigarettes retail share results are based on data from symphonyiri groupcapstone which is a retail tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share performance in retail stores selling cigarettes the panel was not designed to capture sales through other channels including the internet direct mail and some illicitly taxadvantaged outlets 

cigars retail share results are based on data from the symphonyiri group symphonyiri infoscan cigar database for food drug mass merchandisers excluding walmart and convenience trade classes which is a retail tracking service that measures machinemade large cigars market share performance middleton defines machinemade large cigars as cigars made by machine that weigh greater than three pounds per thousand except cigars sold at retail in packages of 20 cigars this service was developed to provide a representation of retail business performance in key trade channels it is symphonyiris standard practice to periodically refresh its infoscan syndicated services which could restate retail share results that were previously released 

pm usa and middleton are transitioning to new retail tracking services to measure cigarette and cigar performance beginning in the first quarter of 2013 

pm usa and middleton executed the following pricing and promotional allowance actions during 2012  2011  and 2010  

▪ effective december 3 2012 pm usa increased the list price on all of its cigarette brands by 006 per pack

▪ effective january 11 2010 middleton executed various list price increases across substantially all of its cigar brands resulting in a weightedaverage increase of approximately 018 per fivepack 

 

the following discussion compares smokeable products segment results for the year ended december 31 2012  with the year ended december 31 2011  

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers increased 246 million 11 due primarily to higher net pricing 404 million which includes higher promotional investments behind marlboro s new brand architecture partially offset by unfavorable mix due to lm s volume growth in discount and lower shipment volume 

operating companies income increased 502 million 88 due primarily to higher net pricing 405 million which includes higher promotional investments marketing administration and research savings reflecting cost reduction initiatives 162 million lower asset impairment exit and implementation costs net primarily related to the 2011 cost reduction program 155 million and lower charges related to tobacco and health judgments 94 million partially offset by unfavorable mix and lower shipment volume 127 million higher per unit settlement charges 123 million and higher manufacturing costs

portions of the information called for by this item are hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs captioned “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – operating results by business segment” on pages 79 to 92 of the 2011 annual report and made a part hereof 

  

tobacco space 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco operating companies include pm usa usstc and other subsidiaries of ust and middleton in addition altria group distribution company provides centralized sales distribution and consumer engagement services for altria group inc’s tobacco operating companies 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco operating companies believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories or use multiple forms of tobacco products and that approximately 30 of adult smokers are interested in spitfree smokeless alternatives to cigarettes 

  

cigarettes pm usa is the largest cigarette company in the united states with total cigarette shipment volume in the united states of approximately 1351 billion units in 2011 a decrease of approximately 40 from 2010 marlboro  the principal cigarette brand of this company has been the largestselling cigarette brand in the united states for over 30 years 

  

smokeless products usstc is the leading producer and marketer of moist smokeless tobacco products the smokeless products segment includes the premium brands copenhagen and skoal  value brands red seal and husky and marlboro snus a pm usa spitless smokeless tobacco product substantially all of the smokeless products are manufactured and sold to customers in the united states total smokeless products shipment volume was 7346 million units in 2011 an increase of 14 from 2010 

  

cigars middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machinemade large cigars and pipe tobacco to customers substantially all of which are located in the united states total shipment volume for the cigars segment was 1246 million units in 2011 which was unchanged from 2010 black  mild is the principal cigar brand of middleton in 2011 middleton entered into a contract manufacturing arrangement to source the production of a portion of its cigars overseas middleton entered into this arrangement to access additional production capacity in an uncertain competitive environment and a tax environment that potentially benefits imported large cigars over those manufactured domestically 

  

distribution competition and raw materials altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services 

  

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts including coupons product promotions and allowances for new products 

  

in june 2009 the president signed into law the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act “fsptca” which provides the united states food and drug administration “fda” with broad authority to regulate the design manufacture packaging advertising promotion sale and distribution of cigarettes cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products the authority to require disclosures of related information and the authority to enforce the fsptca and related regulations the law also grants the fda authority to extend its application by regulation to other tobacco products including cigars the fsptca imposes significant new restrictions on the sale advertising and promotion of tobacco products pm usa and a subsidiary of usstc are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of this legislation and the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product pm usa usstc and other us tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

  

in the united states under a contract growing program pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers under the terms of this program pm usa agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts pm usa also purchases a portion of its united states tobacco requirements through leaf merchants in 2003 pm usa and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quotaholders the agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant including pm usa to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from us tobacco growers over a period of at least ten years these quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement 

  

tobacco production in the united states was historically subject to government controls including the production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law pm usa usstc and middleton are all subject to obligations imposed by fetra fetra eliminated the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout is approximately 95 billion and is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the quota buyout payments had offset pm usa’s obligations to make payments to the national tobacco grower settlement trust the “ntgst” a trust fund established in 1999 by the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers to provide aid to tobacco growers and quota holders pm usa’s payment obligations under the ntgst expired on december 15 2010 

  

in february 2011 pm usa filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the usda’s method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the fetra buyout described above and used by the fda to calculate the industry’s fda user fees pm usa asserts in this litigation that the usda violated fetra and its own regulations by failing to apply the most current federal excise tax “fet” rates enacted by congress which became effective in april 2009 in calculating the class share allocations pm usa has filed administrative appeals of its fetra assessments for fiscal year 2011 all of which have been or are expected to be denied by the usda and has submitted a petition for rulemaking with usda which petition was denied by the usda on november 16 2011 in each case asserting that usda erroneously failed to base the fetra class share allocations on the current fet rates pm usa is appealing the usda’s calculations methodology as well as the denial of the petition for rulemaking and the denial of its quarterly assessment challenges 

  

the quota buyout did not have a material impact on altria group inc’s 2011 consolidated results and altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2012 and beyond 

  

usstc purchases burley dark firecured and aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants 

  

middleton purchases burley and dark aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf merchants middleton does not have a contract growing program 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements 

  

wine 

  

altria group inc acquired ust and its premium wine business ste michelle in january 2009 ste michelle is a producer of premium varietal and blended table wines ste michelle is a leading producer of washington state wines primarily chateau ste michelle and columbia crest  and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other wine regions and foreign countries ste michelle’s total 2011 wine shipment volume of 73 million cases increased 96 from 2010 

  

ste michelle holds an 85 ownership interest in michelleantinori llc which owns stag’s leap wine cellars in napa valley ste michelle also owns conn creek in napa valley and erath in oregon in addition ste michelle distributes antinori and villa maria estate wines and champagne nicolas feuillatte in the united states 

  

distribution competition and raw materials a key element of ste michelle’s strategy is expanded domestic distribution of its wines especially in certain account categories such as restaurants wholesale clubs supermarkets wine shops and mass merchandisers and a focus on improving product mix to higherpriced premium products 

  

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including competition from many larger wellestablished domestic and international companies as well as from many smaller wine producers wine segment competition is primarily based on quality price consumer and trade wine tastings competitive wine judging thirdparty acclaim and advertising substantially all of ste michelle’s sales occur through statelicensed distributors 

  

federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business 

  

ste michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production at the present time ste michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including earnings guidance and other statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to security holders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “objectives” “guidance” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2011 annual report you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law 

  

tobaccorelated litigation  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contraband shipments patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of distributors 

  

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts 

  

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 45 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no 

   

bond at all tobacco litigation plaintiffs however have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge state bond cap statutes in other jurisdictions as well such challenges may include the applicability of state bond caps in federal court although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

  

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see item 3 note 19 and exhibits 991 and 992 for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

tobacco regulation and control action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use restricting marketing and advertising imposing regulations on packaging warnings and disclosure of flavors or other ingredients prohibiting the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors or other characteristics limiting or prohibiting the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes and seeking to hold them responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 

  

pm usa usstc and other altria group inc subsidiaries are subject to regulation and may become subject to additional regulation by the fda as discussed in detail in tobacco space – business environment – fsptca and fda regulation in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2011 annual report we cannot predict how the fda will implement and enforce its statutory authority including by promulgating additional regulations and pursuing possible investigatory or enforcement actions 

  

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels actions by the fda or other federal state or local governments or agencies may impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products limit adult consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products restrict communications to adult consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements require the recall or removal of tobacco products from the marketplace or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business all or any of which may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations or financial condition of altria group inc 

  

excise taxes  tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our tobacco products due to lower 

  

consumption levels and to a potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products such shifts may have an impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries for further discussion see tobacco space – business environment – excise taxes in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2011 annual report 

  

increased competition in the united states tobacco categories  each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category both from existing competitors and new entrants and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands in the cigar category additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machinemade large cigars manufactured offshore 

  

governmental investigations  from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations and it is possible that our subsidiaries’ businesses could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations 

  

new product technologies  altria group inc’s subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers within and potentially outside the united states products that meet their taste expectations and evolving preferences potential solutions being researched include tobaccocontaining and nicotinecontaining products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful these efforts may include arrangements with third parties moreover these efforts may not succeed if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors does our subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of such products with claims of reduced risk to consumers or whether consumers’ purchase decisions would be affected by such claims which could affect the commercial viability of any such products that might be developed 

  

adjacency strategy  altria group inc and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful for a related discussion see new product technologies above 

  

tobacco price availability and quality  any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for a discussion of factors that influence leaf prices availability and quality see tobacco space – business environment – tobacco price availability and quality in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2011 annual report 

  

tobacco key facilities supply security  altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing facilities of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries or the facilities of any significant suppliers of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended interruption in operations experienced by one or more altria group inc subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of altria group inc 

  

attracting and retaining talent  our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result our tobacco subsidiaries may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

  

competition evolving consumer preferences and economic downturns  each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and changes in economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products the volumes of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

  

acquisitions  altria group inc from time to time considers acquisitions from time to time we may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  

capital markets  access to the capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the capital markets and any resulting tightening of credit availability pricing andor credit terms may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

  

exchange rates  for purposes of financial reporting the equity earnings attributable to altria group inc’s investment in sabmiller are translated into us dollars from various local currencies based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported equity earnings in sabmiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer us dollars 

  

asset impairment  we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by several factors including general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings for further discussion see discussion and analysis – critical accounting policies and estimates in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2011 annual report 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the irs has challenged and is expected to further challenge the tax treatment of certain of pmcc’s leveraged leases as discussed in item 3 and note 19 should altria group inc not prevail in any one or more of these matters altria group inc will have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal and state income tax and pay associated interest costs and penalties if imposed in the second quarter of 2011 altria group inc recorded the pmcc leveraged lease charge which is discussed in item 3 note 8 note 15 and note 19 the pmcc leveraged lease charge excludes potential penalties because altria group inc believes that it met the applicable standards to avoid any associated penalties at the time it claimed the deductions on its tax returns 

  

wine – competition grape supply regulation and excise taxes  ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished domestic and international companies the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington state supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment – business environment in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2011 annual report 

  

information systems  altria group inc and its subsidiaries use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others many of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data cause damage to the reputation of our companies and their brands and result in legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs to altria group inc and its subsidiaries

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated and other litigation are or can be significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings  i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred

engle class action 

  

in july 2000 in the second phase of the engle smoking and health class action in florida a jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages totaling approximately 145 billion against various defendants including 74 billion against pm usa following entry of judgment pm usa appealed 

  

in may 2001 the trial court approved a stipulation providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the engle judgment will remain stayed against pm usa and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review as a result of the stipulation pm usa placed 500 million into an interestbearing escrow account that regardless of the outcome of the judicial review was to be paid to the court and the court was to determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with florida rules of civil procedure in may 2003 the florida third district court of appeal reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class plaintiffs petitioned the florida supreme court for further review 

  

in july 2006 the florida supreme court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated that the class approved by the trial court be decertified and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate the court further declared the following phase i findings are entitled to res judicata effect in such individual actions brought within one year of the issuance of the mandate i that smoking causes various diseases ii that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive iii that defendants’ cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous iv that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking v that defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their detriment vi that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment vii that all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective and viii that defendants were negligent the court also reinstated compensatory damages awards totaling approximately 69 million to two individual plaintiffs and found that a third plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations in february 2008 pm usa paid approximately 3 million representing its share of compensatory damages and interest to the two individual plaintiffs identified in the florida supreme court’s order 

  

in august 2006 pm usa sought rehearing from the florida supreme court on parts of its july 2006 opinion including the ruling described above that certain jury findings have res judicata effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by engle class members the rehearing motion also asked among other things that legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the third district court of appeal or in the florida supreme court now be addressed plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in august 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability of the statute of limitations to nonmembers of the decertified class in december 2006 the florida supreme court refused to revise its july 2006 ruling except that it revised the set of phase i findings entitled to res judicata effect by excluding finding v listed above relating to agreement to misrepresent information and added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that at the time of sale or supply did not conform to the representations of fact made by defendants in january 2007 the florida supreme court issued the mandate from its revised opinion defendants then filed a motion with the florida third district court of appeal requesting that the court address legal errors that were previously raised by defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the third district court of appeal or by the florida supreme court in february 2007 the third district court of appeal denied defendants’ 

  

motion in may 2007 defendants’ motion for a partial stay of the mandate pending the completion of appellate review was denied by the third district court of appeal in may 2007 defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court in october 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition in november 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition for rehearing from the denial of their petition for writ of certiorari  

  

in february 2008 the trial court decertified the class except for purposes of the may 2001 bond stipulation and formally vacated the punitive damages award pursuant to the florida supreme court’s mandate in april 2008 the trial court ruled that certain defendants including pm usa lacked standing with respect to allocation of the funds escrowed under the may 2001 bond stipulation and will receive no credit at this time from the 500 million paid by pm usa against any future punitive damages awards in cases brought by former engle class members 

  

in may 2008 the trial court among other things decertified the limited class maintained for purposes of the may 2001 bond stipulation and in july 2008 severed the remaining plaintiffs’ claims except for those of howard engle the only remaining plaintiff in the engle case howard engle voluntarily dismissed his claims with prejudice 

  

the deadline for filing engle progeny cases as required by the florida supreme court’s decision expired in january 2008 as of february 13 2012 approximately 6544 cases 3306 state court cases and 3238 federal court cases were pending against pm usa or altria group inc asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately 8098 plaintiffs 4861 state court plaintiffs and 3237 federal court plaintiffs it is possible that some of these cases are duplicates some of these cases have been removed from various florida state courts to the federal district courts in florida while others were filed in federal court 

  

federal engle progeny cases 

  

three federal district courts in the merlob  b brown and burr cases ruled in 2008 that the findings in the first phase of the engle proceedings cannot be used to satisfy elements of plaintiffs’ claims and two of those rulings  b brown and burr  were certified by the trial court for interlocutory review the certification in both cases was granted by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit and the appeals were consolidated in february 2009 the appeal in burr was dismissed for lack of prosecution in july 2010 the eleventh circuit ruled in b brown that as a matter of florida law plaintiffs do not have an unlimited right to use the findings from the original engle trial to meet their burden of establishing the elements of their claims at trial the eleventh circuit did not reach the issue of whether the use of the engle findings violates the defendants’ due process rights rather plaintiffs may only use the findings to establish those specific facts if any that they demonstrate with a reasonable degree of certainty were actually decided by the original engle jury the eleventh circuit remanded the case to the district court to determine what specific factual findings the engle jury actually made in the burr case pm usa filed a motion seeking a ruling from the district court regarding the preclusive effect of the engle findings pursuant to the eleventh circuit’s decision in b brown  in may 2011 the district court denied that motion without prejudice on procedural grounds 

  

in the waggoner case the united states district court for the middle district of florida jacksonville ruled in december 2011 that application of the engle findings to establish the wrongful conduct elements of plaintiffs’ claims consistent with martin or j brown did not violate defendants’ due process rights the court ruled however that plaintiffs must establish legal causation to establish liability with respect to punitive damages the district court held that plaintiffs could rely on the findings in support of their punitive damages claims but that in addition plaintiffs must demonstrate specific conduct by specific defendants independent of the engle findings that satisfies the standards for awards of punitive damages pm usa and the other defendants sought appellate review of the due 

  

process ruling on february 7 2012 the district court denied the motion for interlocutory appeal but did apply the ruling to all active pending federal engle progeny cases as a result the ruling can be appealed after an adverse verdict 

  

engle progeny cases pending in the federal district courts in the middle district of florida asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately 3200 plaintiffs remain stayed there are currently 31 active cases pending in federal court discovery is proceeding in these cases and the first trial began on february 7 2012 

  

florida bond cap statute 

  

in june 2009 florida amended its existing bond cap statute by adding a 200 million bond cap that applies to all state engle progeny lawsuits in the aggregate and establishes individual bond caps for individual engle progeny cases in amounts that vary depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time plaintiffs in three engle progeny cases against rj reynolds in alachua county florida  alexander townsend and hall  and one case in escambia county  clay  have challenged the constitutionality of the bond cap statute the florida attorney general has intervened in these cases in defense of the constitutionality of the statute 

  

trial court rulings have been rendered in clay alexander townsend and hall rejecting the plaintiffs’ bond cap statute challenges in those cases the plaintiffs have appealed these rulings in alexander  clay and hall  the district court of appeal for the first district of florida affirmed the trial court decisions and certified the decision in hall for appeal to the florida supreme court but declined to certify the question of the constitutionality of the bond cap statute in clay and alexander  the florida supreme court has granted review of the hall decision 

  

no federal court has yet to address the constitutionality of the bond cap statute or the applicability of the bond cap to engle progeny cases tried in federal court 

  

engle progeny trial results 

  

as of february 13 2012 twentyseven engle progeny cases involving pm usa have resulted in verdicts since the florida supreme court engle decision fourteen verdicts see hess barbanell f campbell naugle douglas  r cohen putney kayton formerly tate   piendle  hatziyannakis huish  tullo allen and hallgren descriptions in the table below were returned in favor of plaintiffs and thirteen verdicts were returned in favor of pm usa  gelep kalyvas gil de rubio warrick willis frazier c campbell rohr espinosa oliva weingart junious and szymanski  the jury in the weingart case returned a verdict against pm usa awarding no damages but in september 2011 the trial court granted an additur  for a further discussion of this case see the verdict chart below in addition there have been a number of mistrials only some of which have resulted in new trials as of february 13 2012 

  

in lukacs  a case that was tried to verdict before the florida supreme court engle decision the florida third district court of appeal in march 2010 affirmed per curiam the trial court decision without issuing an opinion under florida procedure further review of a per curiam affirmance without opinion by the florida supreme court is generally prohibited subsequently in 2010 after defendants’ petition for rehearing with the court of appeal was denied defendants paid the judgment 

  

the chart below lists the verdicts and posttrial developments in the engle progeny cases that were pending during 2011 and 2012 in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs 

 

   

   

   

   

   

appeals of engle progeny verdicts 

  

plaintiffs in various engle progeny cases have appealed adverse rulings or verdicts and in some cases pm usa has crossappealed pm usa’s appeals of adverse verdicts are discussed in the chart above 

  

since the remand of b brown discussed above under the heading federal engle progeny cases  the eleventh circuit’s ruling on florida state law is currently superseded by two state appellate rulings in martin  an engle progeny case against rj reynolds in escambia county and j brown  an engle progeny case against rj reynolds in broward county in martin  the florida first district court of appeal rejected the b brown ruling as a matter of state law and upheld the use of the engle findings to relax plaintiffs’ burden of proof rj reynolds had sought florida supreme court review in that case but in july 2011 the florida supreme court declined to hear the appeal in december 2011 petitions for certiorari were filed with the united states supreme court by rj reynolds in campbell martin  gray and hall and by pm usa and liggett group in campbell  

  

in j brown  the florida fourth district court of appeal also rejected the b brown ruling as a matter of state law and upheld the use of the engle findings to relax plaintiffs’ burden of proof however the fourth district expressly disagreed with the first district’s martin decision by ruling that 

  

engle progeny plaintiffs must prove legal causation on their claims in addition the j brown court expressed concerns that using the engle findings to reduce plaintiffs’ burden may violate defendants’ due process rights in october 2011 the fourth district denied rj reynolds’ motion to certify j brown to the florida supreme court for review rj reynolds is seeking review of the case by the florida supreme court 

  

as noted above in federal engle progeny cases  there has been no federal appellate review of the federal due process issues raised by the use of findings from the original engle trial in engle progeny cases 

  

because of the substantial period of time required for the federal and state appellate processes it is possible that pm usa may have to pay certain outstanding judgments in the engle progeny cases before the final adjudication of these issues by the florida supreme court or the united states supreme court 

  

other smoking and health class actions 

  

since the dismissal in may 1996 of a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of allegedly addicted smokers plaintiffs have filed numerous putative smoking and health class action suits in various state and federal courts in general these cases purport to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or states although a few cases purport to be nationwide in scope and raise addiction claims and in many cases claims of physical injury as well 

  

class certification has been denied or reversed by courts in 59 smoking and health class actions involving pm usa in arkansas 1 california 1 the district of columbia 2 florida 2 illinois 3 iowa 1 kansas 1 louisiana 1 maryland 1 michigan 1 minnesota 1 nevada 29 new jersey 6 new york 2 ohio 1 oklahoma 1 pennsylvania 1 puerto rico 1 south carolina 1 texas 1 and wisconsin 1 

  

pm usa and altria group inc are named as defendants along with other cigarette manufacturers in six actions filed in the canadian provinces of alberta manitoba nova scotia saskatchewan and british columbia in saskatchewan and british columbia plaintiffs seek class certification on behalf of individuals who suffer or have suffered from various diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphysema heart disease or cancer after smoking defendants’ cigarettes in the actions filed in alberta manitoba and nova scotia plaintiffs seek certification of classes of all individuals who smoked defendants’ cigarettes see guarantees for a discussion of the distribution agreement between altria group inc and pmi that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products 

  

scott class action 

  

in july 2003 following the first phase of the trial in the scott class action in which plaintiffs sought creation of a fund to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs a louisiana jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants including pm usa in connection with plaintiffs’ medical monitoring claims but also found that plaintiffs could benefit from smoking cessation assistance the jury also found that cigarettes as designed are not defective but that the defendants failed to disclose all they knew about smoking and diseases and marketed their products to minors in may 2004 in the second phase of the trial the jury awarded plaintiffs approximately 590 million against all defendants jointly and severally to fund a 10year smoking cessation program defendants appealed 

  

in april 2010 the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal issued a decision that affirmed in part prior decisions ordering the defendants to fund a statewide 10year smoking cessation program after conducting its own independent review of the record the court of appeal made its own factual findings 

  

with respect to liability and the amount owed lowering the amount of the judgment to approximately 241 million plus interest commencing july 21 2008 the date of entry of the amended judgment in addition the court of appeal declined plaintiffs’ cross appeal requests for a medical monitoring program and reinstatement of other components of the smoking cessation program the court of appeal specifically reserved to the defendants the right to assert claims to any unspent or unused surplus funds at the termination of the smoking cessation program in june 2010 defendants and plaintiffs filed separate writ of certiorari applications with the louisiana supreme court the louisiana supreme court denied both sides’ applications in september 2010 upon defendants’ application the united states supreme court granted a stay of the judgment pending the defendants’ filing and the court’s disposition of the defendants’ petition for a writ of certiorari  in june 2011 the united states supreme court denied the defendants’ petition as of march 31 2011 pm usa recorded a provision of 26 million in connection with the case and additional provisions of approximately 37 million related to accrued interest in the second quarter of 2011 after the june 2011 united states supreme court denial of defendants’ petition for a writ of certiorari  pm usa recorded an additional provision of approximately 36 million related to the judgment and approximately 5 million related to interest 

  

in august 2011 pm usa paid its share of the judgment in an amount of approximately 70 million the defendants’ payments have been deposited into a courtsupervised fund that is intended to pay for smoking cessation programs in october 2011 plaintiffs’ counsel filed a motion for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs plaintiffs’ counsel seek additional fees from defendants ranging from 91 million to 642 million additionally plaintiffs’ counsel request an award of approximately 13 million in costs as of december 31 2011 pm usa had recorded a provision of approximately 13 million for costs but is opposing plaintiffs’ counsel’s request for additional costs and for fees argument on whether defendants can be held liable for attorneys’ fees occurred on february 3 2012 

  

other medical monitoring class actions 

  

in addition to the scott class action discussed above two purported medical monitoring class actions are pending against pm usa these two cases were brought in new york  caronia  filed in january 2006 in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york and massachusetts  donovan  filed in december 2006 in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on behalf of each state’s respective residents who are age 50 or older have smoked the marlboro brand for 20 packyears or more and have neither been diagnosed with lung cancer nor are under investigation by a physician for suspected lung cancer plaintiffs in these cases seek to impose liability under various productbased causes of action and the creation of a courtsupervised program providing members of the purported class low dose ct scanning in order to identify and diagnose lung cancer plaintiffs in these cases do not seek punitive damages a case brought in california  xavier  was dismissed in july 2011 and a case brought in florida  gargano  was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice in august 2011 

  

in caronia  in february 2010 the district court granted in part pm usa’s summary judgment motion dismissing plaintiffs’ strict liability and negligence claims and certain other claims granted plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to allege a medical monitoring cause of action and requested further briefing on pm usa’s summary judgment motion as to plaintiffs’ implied warranty claim and if plaintiffs amend their complaint their medical monitoring claim in march 2010 plaintiffs filed their amended complaint and pm usa moved to dismiss the implied warranty and medical monitoring claims in january 2011 the district court granted pm usa’s motion dismissed plaintiffs’ claims and declared plaintiffs’ motion for class certification moot in light of the dismissal of the case the plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit argument has been set for march 1 2012 

  

in donovan  the supreme judicial court of massachusetts in answering questions certified to it by the district court held in october 2009 that under certain circumstances state law recognizes a claim 

  

by individual smokers for medical monitoring despite the absence of an actual injury the court also ruled that whether or not the case is barred by the applicable statute of limitations is a factual issue to be determined by the trial court the case was remanded to federal court for further proceedings in june 2010 the district court granted in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification certifying the class as to plaintiffs’ claims for breach of implied warranty and violation of the massachusetts consumer protection act but denying certification as to plaintiffs’ negligence claim in july 2010 pm usa petitioned the united states court of appeals for the first circuit for appellate review of the class certification decision the petition was denied in september 2010 as a remedy plaintiffs have proposed a 28year medical monitoring program with an approximate cost of 190 million in april 2011 plaintiffs moved to amend their class certification to extend the cutoff date for individuals to satisfy the class membership criteria from december 14 2006 to august 1 2011 the district court granted this motion in may 2011 trial has been postponed in june 2011 plaintiffs filed various motions for summary judgment and to strike affirmative defenses in october 2011 pm usa filed a motion for class decertification argument occurred on january 27 2012 

  

evolving medical standards and practices could have an impact on the defense of medical monitoring claims for example the first publication of the findings of the national cancer institute’s national lung screening trial nlst in june 2011 reported a 20 reduction in lung cancer deaths among certain long term smokers receiving low dose ct scanning for lung cancer since then various public health organizations have begun to develop new lung cancer screening guidelines also a number of hospitals have advertised the availability of screening programs 

  

health care cost recovery litigation 

  

overview 

  

in the health care cost recovery litigation governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  

the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  

defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  

although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions in the united states have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and eight state appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals 

  

in april 2011 in the health care cost recovery case brought against pm usa and other defendants by the city of st louis missouri and approximately 40 missouri hospitals the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts in june 2011 the litigation was concluded in a consent judgment pursuant to which the plaintiffs waived all rights to appeal in exchange for the defendants’ waiver of any claim for costs 

  

individuals and associations have also sued in purported class actions or as private attorneys general under the medicare as secondary payer “msp” provisions of the social security act to recover from defendants medicare expenditures allegedly incurred for the treatment of smokingrelated diseases cases were brought in new york 2 florida 2 and massachusetts 1 all were dismissed by federal courts 

  

in addition to the cases brought in the united states health care cost recovery actions have also been brought against tobacco industry participants including pm usa and altria group inc in israel 1 recently dismissed the marshall islands dismissed and canada 4 and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions in the case in israel  clalit  in july 2011 the israel supreme court reversed the trial court’s decision denying defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the case in august 2011 plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing with the israel supreme court which the court denied on january 26 2012 this litigation has concluded 

  

in september 2005 in the first of the four health care cost recovery cases filed in canada the canadian supreme court ruled that legislation passed in british columbia permitting the lawsuit is constitutional and as a result the case which had previously been dismissed by the trial court was permitted to proceed pm usa’s and other defendants’ challenge to the british columbia court’s exercise of jurisdiction was rejected by the court of appeals of british columbia and in april 2007 the supreme court of canada denied review of that decision in december 2009 the court of appeals of british columbia ruled that certain defendants can proceed against the federal government of canada as third parties on the theory that the federal government of canada negligently misrepresented to defendants the efficacy of a low tar tobacco variety that the federal government of canada developed and licensed to defendants in may 2010 the supreme court of canada granted leave to the federal government of canada to appeal this decision and leave to defendants to crossappeal the court of appeals’ decision to dismiss claims against the federal government of canada based on other theories of liability in july 2011 the supreme court of canada dismissed the thirdparty claims against the federal government of canada 

  

during 2008 the province of new brunswick canada proclaimed into law previously adopted legislation allowing reimbursement claims to be brought against cigarette manufacturers and it filed suit shortly thereafter in september 2009 the province of ontario canada filed suit against a number of cigarette manufacturers based on previously adopted legislation nearly identical in substance to the new brunswick health care cost recovery legislation in february 2011 the province of newfoundland and labrador filed a case substantially similar to the ones brought by new brunswick and ontario 

  

pm usa is named as a defendant in the british columbia case while altria group inc and pm usa are named as defendants in the new brunswick ontario and newfoundland cases several other provinces and territories in canada have enacted similar legislation or are in the process of enacting 

  

similar legislation see guarantees for a discussion of the distribution agreement between altria group inc and pmi that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products 

  

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  

in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the original participating manufacturers make substantial annual payments of approximately 94 billion each year subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume in addition the original participating manufacturers are required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the state settlement agreements and the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was approximately 48 billion 48 billion and 50 billion respectively 

  

the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  

possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003 to 2010 

  

pursuant to the provisions of the msa domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa who are original signatories to the msa the “original participating manufacturers” or “opms” are participating in proceedings that may result in downward adjustments to the amounts paid by the opms and the other msaparticipating manufacturers to the states and territories that are parties to the msa for each of the years 2003 to 2010 the proceedings relate to an msa payment adjustment the “npm adjustment” based on the collective loss of market share for the relevant year by all participating manufacturers who are subject to the payment obligations and marketing restrictions of the msa to nonparticipating manufacturers “npms” who are not subject to such obligations and restrictions 

  

as part of these proceedings an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the msa parties or otherwise selected pursuant to the msa’s provisions is required to determine whether the disadvantages of the msa were a “significant factor” contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year in question if the firm determines that the disadvantages of the msa were such a “significant factor” each state may avoid a downward adjustment to its share of the participating manufacturers’ annual payments for that year by establishing that it diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during the entirety of that year any potential downward adjustment would then be reallocated to any states that do not establish such diligent enforcement pm usa believes that the msa’s arbitration clause requires a state to submit its claim to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute to binding arbitration before a panel of three former federal judges in the manner provided for in the msa a number of states have taken the position that this claim should be decided in state court on a statebystate basis 

  

an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the msa parties determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for each of the years 2003 – 2005 a different independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the msa parties determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share 

  

for the year 2006 following the firm’s determination for 2006 the opms and the states agreed that the states would not contest that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the years 2007 2008 and 2009 accordingly the opms and the states have agreed that no “significant factor” determination by an independent economic consulting firm will be necessary with respect to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the years 2007 2008 and 2009 the “significant factor agreement” this agreement became effective for 2007 2008 and 2009 on february 1 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively the msa’s independent auditor has determined that the participating manufacturers collectively lost market share for 2010 subsequent to that determination the opms and the states have agreed to extend the significant factor agreement to apply to such collective loss of market share for 2010 as well as to any collective loss of market share that the participating manufacturers experience for 20112012 this agreement will become effective for 2010 on february 1 2013 if the independent auditor determines that the participating manufacturers collectively lost market share for 2011 or 2012 this agreement will become effective for 2011 on february 1 2014 and for 2012 on february 1 2015 

  

following the “significant factor” determination with respect to 2003 thirtyeight states filed declaratory judgment actions in state courts seeking a declaration that the state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers responded to these actions by filing motions to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the msa including filing motions to compel arbitration in eleven msa states and territories that did not file declaratory judgment actions courts in all but one of the fortysix msa states and the district of columbia and puerto rico have ruled that the question of whether a state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 is subject to arbitration several of these rulings may be subject to further review one state court in state of montana  has ruled that the diligent enforcement claims of that state may be litigated in state court rather than in arbitration in january 2010 the opms filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking further review of the montana decision holding that a state’s diligent enforcement claims may be litigated in state court rather than in arbitration the petition was denied in june 2010 following the denial of this petition montana renewed an action in its state court seeking a declaratory judgment that it diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 and other relief the case is now proceeding in the trial court 

  

pm usa the other opms and approximately twentyfive other msaparticipating manufacturers have entered into an agreement regarding arbitration with fortyfive msa states concerning the 2003 npm adjustment including the states’ claims of diligent enforcement for 2003 the agreement further provides for a partial liability reduction for the 2003 npm adjustment for states that entered into the agreement by january 30 2009 and are determined in the arbitration not to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during 2003 based on the number of states that entered into the agreement by january 30 2009 fortyfive the partial liability reduction for those states is 20 the partial liability reduction would reduce the amount of pm usa’s 2003 npm adjustment by up to a corresponding percentage the selection of the arbitration panel for the 2003 npm adjustment was completed in july 2010 and the arbitration is currently ongoing proceedings to determine state diligent enforcement claims for the years 2004 through 2010 have not yet been scheduled 

  

once a significant factor determination in favor of the participating manufacturers for a particular year has been made by an economic consulting firm or the states’ agreement not to contest significant factor for a particular year has become effective pm usa has the right under the msa to pay the disputed amount of the npm adjustment for that year into a disputed payments account or withhold it altogether pm usa has made its full msa payment due in each year from 2006 – 2010 to the states subject to a right to recoup the npm adjustment amount in the form of a credit against future msa payments even though it had the right to deduct the disputed amounts of the 2003 – 2007 npm adjustments as described above from such msa payments pm usa paid its share of the amount of the disputed 2008 npm adjustment shown below into the msa’s disputed payments account in 

  

connection with its msa payment due in 2011 the approximate maximum principal amounts of pm usa’s share of the disputed npm adjustment for the years 2003 through 2010 as currently calculated by the msa’s independent auditor are as follows the amounts shown below do not include the interest or earnings thereon to which pm usa believes it would be entitled in the manner provided in the msa 

 

   

the foregoing amounts may be recalculated by the independent auditor if it receives information that is different from or in addition to the information on which it based these calculations including among other things if it receives revised sales volumes from any participating manufacturer disputes among the manufacturers could also reduce the foregoing amounts the availability and the precise amount of any npm adjustment for 20032010 will not be finally determined until 2013 or thereafter there is no certainty that the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers will ultimately receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings and the amount of any adjustment received for a year could be less than the amount for that year listed above if the opms do receive such an adjustment through these proceedings the adjustment would be allocated among the opms pursuant to the msa’s provisions it is expected that pm usa would receive its share of any adjustments for 2003 – 2007 in the form of a credit against future msa payments and its share of any adjustment for 2008 in the form of a withdrawal from the disputed payments account 

  

pm usa intends to pursue vigorously the disputed npm adjustments for 20032010 through the proceedings described above pm usa would be willing however to enter into a settlement of those disputed npm adjustments if it determined that such a settlement were in its best interests 

  

other disputes related to msa payments 

  

in addition to the disputed npm adjustments described above msa states and participating manufacturers including pm usa are conducting another arbitration to resolve certain other disputes related to the calculation of the participating manufacturers’ payments under the msa pm usa disputes the method by which ounces of “roll your own” tobacco have been converted to cigarettes for purposes of calculating the downward volume adjustments to its msa payments pm usa believes that for the years 2004 – 2010 the use of an incorrect conversion method resulted in excess msa payments by pm usa of approximately 85 million in the aggregate if pm usa prevails on this issue it would be entitled to a credit against future msa payments in that amount plus interest in addition pm usa seeks application of what it believes to be the correct method for years subsequent to 2010 

  

this arbitration will also resolve a dispute concerning whether the total domestic cigarette market and certain other calculations related to the participating manufacturers’ msa payments should be determined based on the “net” number of cigarettes on which federal excise tax is paid as is currently the case or whether the “adjusted gross” number of cigarettes on which federal excise tax is paid is the correct methodology pm usa anticipates that this arbitration will not be concluded until later in 2012 or thereafter 

  

no assurance can be given that pm usa will prevail in this arbitration 

  

other msarelated litigation 

  

pm usa was named as a defendant in an action  vibo  brought in october 2008 in federal court in kentucky by an msa participating manufacturer that is not an opm other defendants include various other participating manufacturers and the attorneys general of all 52 states and territories that are parties to the msa the plaintiff alleged that certain of the msa’s payment provisions discriminate against it in favor of certain other participating manufacturers in violation of the federal antitrust laws and the united states constitution the plaintiff also sought injunctive relief alteration of certain msa payment provisions as applied to it treble damages under the federal antitrust laws andor rescission of its joinder in the msa the plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the states from enforcing the allegedly discriminatory payment provisions against it during the pendency of the action in january 2009 the district court dismissed the complaint and denied plaintiff’s request for preliminary injunctive relief in january 2010 the court entered final judgment dismissing the case plaintiff appealed this decision to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit argument was heard in october 2011 

  

without naming pm usa or any other private party as a defendant npms andor their distributors or customers have filed several legal challenges to the msa and related legislation new york state officials and the attorneys general for 18 other states are defendants in a lawsuit  king formerly pryor  filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in which plaintiffs allege that the msa andor related legislation violates federal antitrust laws and the commerce clause of the united states constitution the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has held that the allegations in that lawsuit if proven establish a basis for relief on antitrust and commerce clause grounds and that the trial courts in new york have personal jurisdiction sufficient to enjoin other states’ officials from enforcing their msarelated legislation on remand the trial court held that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits and refused to enjoin the enforcement of new york’s allocable share amendment to the msa’s model escrow statute that decision was affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in march 2011 the trial court granted summary judgment on all claims for the new york state officials plaintiffs filed a motion to modify the judgment which the trial court denied on january 30 2012 the matter is now on appeal before the second circuit in october november and december 2011 plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed six states from the case 

  

in addition to the king decision above the united states courts of appeals for the second fifth sixth eighth ninth and tenth circuits have affirmed dismissals or grants of summary judgment in favor of state officials in seven other cases asserting antitrust and constitutional challenges to the allocable share amendment legislation in those states 

  

in january 2011 an international arbitration tribunal rejected claims brought against the united states challenging msarelated legislation in various states under the north american free trade agreement 

  

federal government’s lawsuit 

  

in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others including altria group inc asserting claims under three federal statutes namely the medical care recovery act “mcra” the msp provisions of the social security act and the civil provisions of rico trial of the case ended in june 2005 the lawsuit sought to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobaccorelated illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs including medicare military and veterans’ health benefits programs and the federal employees health benefits program the complaint alleged that such costs total more than 20 billion annually it also sought what it alleged to be equitable and declaratory relief including disgorgement of profits which arose from defendants’ 

  

allegedly tortious conduct an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct in september 2000 the trial court dismissed the government’s mcra and msp claims but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief under the civil provisions of rico 

  

the government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2004 the trial court issued an order denying defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy in february 2005 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under the civil provisions of rico and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim in july 2005 the government petitioned the united states supreme court for further review of the court of appeals’ ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy and in october 2005 the supreme court denied the petition 

  

in june 2005 the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment seeking remedies of approximately 14 billion including 10 billion over a fiveyear period to fund a national smoking cessation program and 4 billion over a tenyear period to fund a public education and countermarketing campaign further the government’s proposed remedy would have required defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 are not achieved according to a prescribed timetable the government’s proposed remedies also included a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business operations – including but not limited to restrictions on advertising and marketing potential measures with respect to certain price promotional activities and research and development disclosure requirements for certain confidential data and implementation of a monitoring system with potential broad powers over cigarette operations 

  

in august 2006 the federal trial court entered judgment in favor of the government the court held that certain defendants including altria group inc and pm usa violated rico and engaged in 7 of the 8 “subschemes” to defraud that the government had alleged specifically the court found that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the court did not impose monetary penalties on the defendants but ordered the following relief i an injunction against “committing any act of racketeering” relating to the manufacturing marketing promotion health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states ii an injunction against participating directly or indirectly in the management or control of the council for tobacco research the tobacco institute or the center for indoor air research or any successor or affiliated entities of each iii an injunction against “making or causing to be made in any way any material false misleading or deceptive statement or representation or engaging in any public relations or marketing endeavor that is disseminated to the united states public and that misrepresents or suppresses 

  

information concerning cigarettes” iv an injunction against conveying any express or implied health message through use of descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material including “lights” “ultra lights” and “low tar” which the court found could cause consumers to believe one cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand v the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking “low tar” or “light” cigarettes defendants’ manipulation of cigarette design to ensure optimum nicotine delivery and the adverse health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke vi the disclosure on defendants’ public document websites and in the minnesota document repository of all documents produced to the government in the lawsuit or produced in any future court or administrative action concerning smoking and health until 2021 with certain additional requirements as to documents withheld from production under a claim of privilege or confidentiality vii the disclosure of disaggregated marketing data to the government in the same form and on the same schedule as defendants now follow in disclosing such data to the federal trade commission “ftc” for a period of ten years viii certain restrictions on the sale or transfer by defendants of any cigarette brands brand names formulas or cigarette businesses within the united states and ix payment of the government’s costs in bringing the action 

  

the defendants appealed and in may 2009 a three judge panel of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a per curiam decision largely affirming the trial court’s judgment against defendants and in favor of the government although the panel largely affirmed the remedial order that was issued by the trial court it vacated the following aspects of the order 

  

   

   

   

   

the court of appeals panel remanded the case for the trial court to reconsider these four aspects of the injunction and to reformulate its remedial order accordingly 

  

furthermore the court of appeals panel rejected all of the government’s and intervenors’ cross appeal arguments and refused to broaden the remedial order entered by the trial court the court of appeals panel also left undisturbed its prior holding that the government cannot obtain disgorgement as a permissible remedy under rico 

  

in july 2009 defendants filed petitions for a rehearing before the panel and for a rehearing by the entire court of appeals defendants also filed a motion to vacate portions of the trial court’s judgment on the grounds of mootness because of the passage of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act “fsptca” granting the united states food and drug administration the “fda” broad authority over the regulation of tobacco products in september 2009 the court of appeals entered three per curiam rulings two of them denied defendants’ petitions for panel rehearing or for rehearing en banc  in the third per curiam decision the court of appeals denied defendants’ suggestion of mootness and motion for partial vacatur  in february 2010 pm usa and altria group inc filed their certiorari petitions with the united states supreme court in addition the federal government and the intervenors filed their own certiorari petitions asking the court to reverse an earlier court of appeals decision and hold that civil rico allows the trial court to order disgorgement as well as other equitable relief such as smoking cessation remedies designed to redress continuing consequences of prior rico violations in june 2010 the united states supreme court denied all of the parties’ petitions in july 2010 the court of appeals issued its mandate lifting the stay of the trial court’s judgment and 

  

remanding the case to the trial court as a result of the mandate except for those matters remanded to the trial court for further proceedings defendants are now subject to the injunction discussed above and the other elements of the trial court’s judgment 

  

in february 2011 the government submitted its proposed corrective statements and the trial court referred issues relating to a document repository to a special master the defendants filed a response to the government’s proposed corrective statements and filed a motion to vacate the trial court’s injunction in light of the fsptca which motion was denied in june 2011 the defendants have appealed the trial court’s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit argument is scheduled for april 20 2012 

  

apart from the matters on appeal two issues remain pending before the district court i the substance of the courtordered corrective statements and ii the requirements related to pointofsale signage in november 2011 the district court ordered the parties to submit their views on whether the district court should delay its order on these issues while other courts decide more recent cases challenging the fda’s new rules imposing certain tobacco marketing restrictions and graphic warnings the parties complied with the district court’s requests and defendants asked the court to defer resolution of these issues until these other cases are fully resolved on january 26 2012 the district court ruled that it would not delay its decision until after the resolution of the cases challenging the fda’s new rules the district court has not addressed the content of the corrective communications or the requirements related to pointofsale signage 

  

in december 2011 the parties to the lawsuit entered into an agreement as to the issues concerning the document repository pursuant to this agreement pm usa agreed to deposit an amount of approximately 31 million into the district court

irs challenges to pmcc leases 

  

background  the irs has concluded its examination of altria group inc’s consolidated federal income tax returns for the years 1996 through 2003 and for each year has disallowed tax benefits pertaining to certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by pmcc referred to by the irs as leaseinleaseout “lilo” and saleinleaseout “silo” transactions for financial reporting purposes pmcc accounted for lilo and silo transactions as leveraged lease transactions under the guidance in accounting standards codification “asc” 840 leases “asc 840” for income tax purposes pmcc treated these transactions as leases under case law and applicable irs administrative guidance for the 1996 through 2009 tax years 

  

refund claims and litigation  altria group inc believes that its tax treatment of pmcc’s lilo and silo transactions on federal and state income tax returns for the 1996 through 2009 tax years was proper and complied with applicable tax laws in effect during the relevant periods altria group inc has contested the disallowances for the 1996 through 2003 tax years filed claims for refunds of federal income tax and associated interest paid and pursued or is pursuing refund litigation in federal court with respect to certain of the refund claims as discussed below 

  

in october 2006 altria group inc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york to claim a refund on a portion of these federal income tax payments and associated interest for the years 1996 and 1997 attributable to lilo and silo transactions entered into during those years in july 2009 the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the irs and in april 2010 after denying altria group inc’s posttrial motions the district court entered final judgment in favor of the irs altria group inc filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in june 2010 in september 2011 the second circuit affirmed the district court decision in favor of the irs altria group inc has elected not to pursue further judicial review of its refund claim for the 1996 and 1997 transactions 

  

in march 2008 altria group inc filed a second complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking a refund of the federal income tax payments and associated interest for the years 1998 and 1999 attributable to the disallowance of tax benefits claimed in those years with respect to the lilo and silo transactions subject to the jury verdict and with respect to the additional lilo and silo transactions entered into in 1998 and 1999 in may 2009 the district court granted a stay pending the decision by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in the appeal involving the 1996 and 1997 transactions following altria group inc’s decision not to pursue further judicial review of its refund claim regarding the 1996 and 1997 transactions the case for the 1998 and 1999 years has been reactivated 

  

in march 2011 altria group inc filed claims for a refund with the irs for the years 2000 through 2003 of the tax and associated interest paid with respect to the lilo and silo transactions that pmcc entered into during the 19962003 years the irs disallowed the claims in july 2011 and altria group inc intends to commence litigation in federal court 

  

in a closing agreement entered into in may 2010 altria group inc and the irs agreed that with the exception of the lilo and silo transactions the tax treatment reported by altria group inc on its consolidated federal income tax returns for the 20002003 years as amended by the agreedupon adjustments in the closing agreement is appropriate and final the irs may not assess against altria group inc any further taxes or additions to tax including penalties with respect to these years 

  

as a prerequisite to commencing in federal court the refund litigation described above following the irs disallowance of tax benefits of the lilo and silo transactions for the 19961999 audit cycle in 2006 altria group inc paid approximately 150 million related to disallowed tax benefits and 

  

associated interest similarly following the irs disallowance of tax benefits of the lilo and silo transactions for the 20002003 audit cycle also described above in 2010 altria group inc paid approximately 945 million in disallowed tax benefits and associated interest in order to pursue its legal challenge to the disallowances in federal court 

  

payments to the irs  as indicated in “refund claims and litigation” above altria group inc has paid a total of approximately 11 billion in federal income tax payments and interest with respect to the lilo and silo transactions for the 1996 through 2003 tax years the tax component of this amount represents an acceleration of taxes that altria group inc would have otherwise paid over the later stages of the lilo and silo transactions altria group inc treated the amounts paid to the irs for these years as deposits for financial reporting purposes pending the ultimate outcomes of the litigation altria group inc included such amounts in other assets on its consolidated balance sheets and did not include such amounts in the supplemental disclosure of cash paid for income taxes on the consolidated statement of cash flows as a result of its decision not to pursue further judicial review of its refund claims for the 1996 and 1997 transactions altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011 reflects reductions in both other assets and tax liabilities of approximately 362 million which is the amount of taxes and interest that altria group inc has previously paid related to the 1996 and 1997 transactions for the 1996 through 2003 tax years this payment has been included in the supplemental disclosure of cash paid for income taxes on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2011 the impact of these payments on altria group inc’s earnings has previously been recorded on its financial statements as discussed below if altria group inc were to prevail in the current andor anticipated refund litigation it would receive a refund of the remaining amounts paid to the irs plus interest if the irs’s position with respect to the lilo and silo transactions is ultimately sustained altria group inc would further reduce its tax liabilities and the asset discussed above 

  

anticipated future disallowances and additional payments to the irs  altria group inc further expects the irs and impacted states to disallow income tax benefits claimed in years 2004 through 2009 related to the lilo and silo transactions that pmcc entered into from 1996 through 2003 the disallowance of federal and state income tax benefits for the 2004 through 2009 tax years and associated interest through the 2011 tax year would result in additional payments of approximately 600 million excluding potential penalties the tax component of this amount represents an acceleration of taxes that altria group inc would have otherwise paid over the later stages of the lilo and silo transactions this amount is net of federal and state income taxes paid on gains associated with sales of leased assets from january 1 2008 through december 31 2011 and excludes additional taxes paid in 2011 for the 2010 and 2011 tax years as a result of the decision discussed below not to claim tax benefits for the 2010 and future tax years although the initial amount payable may be greater than 600 million such taxes paid on gains associated with sales of leased assets will be subsequently recovered no later than the closing of the audits for the cycles in which the sales have occurred the payments of disallowed tax benefits if any would depend upon the timing and outcome of future irs audits and any related administrative challenges or litigation the irs is currently auditing the 20042006 tax years 

  

2010 and future tax years  altria group inc did not claim tax benefits pertaining to pmcc’s lilo and silo transactions on its federal and state income tax returns for 2010 and at this time does not intend to claim such tax benefits in future years altria group inc however intends to preserve its right to file amended returns for these years claiming the tax benefits pertaining to pmcc’s lilo and silo transactions if altria group inc is successful in the current andor anticipated litigation discussed above 

  

second quarter 2011 earnings charge  altria group inc has continually reevaluated the likelihood of sustaining its tax position on pmcc’s lilo and silo transactions as required by asc 740 income taxes “asc 740” in the second quarter of 2011 in accordance with asc 840 and asc 740 altria group inc recorded a onetime charge of 627 million against its 2011 reported 

  

earnings related to the tax treatment of the lilo and silo transactions that pmcc entered into between 1996 and 2003 altria group inc’s decision to record the charge was based on the federal circuit’s april 2011 adverse decision in wells fargo  co v united states  involving silo transactions entered into by another taxpayer altria group inc concluded that the decision introduced incremental risk to its tax analysis and as a result that it was no longer more likely than not that it would prevail in its defense of its tax position on pmcc’s lilo and silo transactions 

  

the charge of 627 million reflects the recharacterization of pmcc’s lilo and silo transactions as loans as opposed to leases for income tax purposes which changes the timing of income recognition for tax purposes over the term of the deemed loan this change in turn impacts the income of the leases recorded pursuant to leveraged lease accounting asc 840 resulting in a lowering of the cumulative income from the transactions that had been recorded from inception of the transactions to the date of the charge this earnings charge is incremental to 146 million recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity upon the adoption of new accounting standards for leases “fas 132” and for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” on january 1 2007 and approximately 95 million recorded to the statements of earnings from january 1 2007 through march 31 2011 in quantifying the reduction in cumulative leveraged lease income to include in the second quarter 2011 earnings charge altria group inc was required to make assumptions regarding a potential settlement of these matters with the irs to the extent the assumptions change there may be additional impact on altria group inc’s earnings but altria group inc does not expect such impact if any to be significant 

  

approximately 50 of the 627 million charge represents the effects of recharacterization of the transactions as loans and the resulting reduction in cumulative leveraged lease income described above this reduction in income will be recaptured over the remaining terms of the respective transactions the remaining portion of the charge primarily represents a permanent charge for interest on tax underpayments the charge does not include potential penalties as altria group inc believes that it met the applicable standards to avoid any associated penalties at the time it claimed the deductions on its tax returns 

  

as of december 31 2011 the lilo and silo transactions represented approximately 30 of the net finance assets of pmcc’s lease portfolio pmcc has not entered into any lilo or silo transactions since 2003 

  

kraft thrift plan cases  four participants in the kraft foods global inc thrift plan “kraft thrift plan” a defined contribution plan filed a class action complaint  george ii  on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries of the kraft thrift plan in july 2008 in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging breach of fiduciary duty under the employee retirement income security act “erisa” named defendants in this action include altria corporate services inc now altria client services inc and certain company committees that allegedly had a relationship to the kraft thrift plan plaintiffs request among other remedies that defendants restore to the kraft thrift plan all losses improperly incurred

for summary judgment in january 2011 and plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment in march 2011 defendants filed a motion to vacate the class certification in light of recent federal judicial precedent in july 2011 the court granted defendants’ summary judgment motion in part finding that claims for periods prior to july 2 2002 were time barred and that the defendants properly monitored the funds the court also denied plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment remaining in the case are claims after july 2 2002 relating to whether it was prudent to retain actively managed investments growth equity fund and balanced fund in the kraft thrift plan after 1999 in july 2011 the court also granted defendants’ motion to vacate the class certification and allowed plaintiffs leave to file a new motion for class certification in light of recent precedent and the court’s summary judgment findings plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class is pending before the court 

  

in august 2011 altria client services inc and a company committee that allegedly had a relationship to the kraft thrift plan were added as defendants in another class action previously brought by the same plaintiffs in 2006  george i  in which plaintiffs allege defendants breached their fiduciary duties under erisa by offering company stock funds in a unitized format and by allegedly overpaying for recordkeeping services 

  

the parties have reached a proposed classwide settlement the proposed settlement which does not require any payment by the altria group inc defendants is subject to court approval which is pending under the terms of a distribution agreement between altria group inc and kraft the altria group inc defendants may be entitled to indemnity against any liabilities incurred in connection with these cases

undertake in the future in the opinion of management however compliance with environmental laws and regulations including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations capital expenditures financial position or cash flows

the noncontrolling interest put arrangement is accounted for as mandatorily redeemable securities because redemption is outside of the control of ste michelle as such the redeemable noncontrolling interest is reported in the mezzanine equity section in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 and 2010

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services 

  

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts including coupons product promotions and allowances for new products the tobacco products of altria group inc’s subsidiaries are promoted through various means although television and radio advertising of certain tobacco products is prohibited in the united states in addition the fsptca imposes significant new restrictions on the sale advertising and promotion of tobacco products and as discussed below in item 3 legal proceedings “item 3” and note 21 contingencies to altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2010 annual report “note 21” pm usa usstc and other us tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions

tobacco production in the united states was historically subject to government controls including the production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law pm usa usstc and middleton are all subject to obligations imposed by fetra fetra eliminated the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout is approximately 95 billion and is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the quota buyout payments had offset pm usa’s obligations to make payments to the national tobacco grower settlement trust the “ntgst” a trust fund established in 1999 by the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers to provide aid to tobacco growers and quota holders pm usa’s payment obligations under the ntgst expired on december 15 2010 

  

on february 8 2011 pm usa filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the usda’s method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco class share allocations for the tobacco transition payment program under fetra pm usa believes that the usda violated fetra and its own regulations by failing to apply the most recent fet rates enacted by congress in april 2009 to the usda’s calculations 

  

the quota buyout did not have a material impact on altria group inc’s 2010 consolidated results and altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2011 and beyond 

  

usstc purchases burley dark firecured and aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants 

  

middleton purchases burley dark aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf merchants middleton does not have a contract growing program 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements 

  

wine 

  

altria group inc acquired ust and its premium wine business ste michelle in january 2009 ste michelle is a producer of premium varietal and blended table wines ste michelle is a leading producer of washington state wines primarily chateau ste michelle and columbia crest and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other wine regions  ste michelle holds an 85 ownership interest in michelleantinori llc which owns stag’s leap wine cellars in napa valley ste michelle also owns conn creek in napa valley and erath in oregon in addition ste michelle distributes antinori and villa maria estate wines and champagne nicolas feuillatte in the united states 

  

the following table summarizes wine segment case shipment volume performance 

  

   

ste michelle’s wine shipment volume of 67 million cases for 2010 increased 113 versus 2009 

  

during 2010 ste michelle’s retail unit volume as measured by the nielsen company “nielsen” and its nielsen total wine database – us food drug  liquor increased 56 versus 2009 ste michelle’s retail unit volume percentage change is based on data from nielsen which tracks retail metrics in the wine space it is nielsen’s standard practice to refresh its syndicated databases periodically which could restate retail metrics that were previously released ste michelle’s retail unit volume includes villa maria estate in 2010 and excludes it in 2009 ste michelle gained distribution rights to villa maria estate in 2010 

  

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

a key element of ste michelle’s strategy is expanded domestic distribution of its wines especially in certain account categories such as restaurants wholesale clubs supermarkets wine shops and mass merchandisers 

  

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including competition from many larger wellestablished domestic and international companies as well as from many smaller wine producers wine segment competition is primarily based on quality price consumer and trade wine tastings competitive wine judging thirdparty acclaim and advertising substantially all of ste michelle’s sales occur through statelicensed distributors 

  

federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business 

  

ste michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production at the present time ste michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to security holders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “forecasts” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2010 annual report you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time 

   

tobaccorelated litigation  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contraband shipments patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

  

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts 

  

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 43 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed in note 21 and item 3 tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge other state bond cap statutes although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

  

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see note 21 item 3 and exhibits 991 and 992 for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

tobacco regulation and control action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use restricting marketing and advertising imposing regulations on packaging warnings and disclosure of flavors or other ingredients prohibiting the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors or other characteristics limiting or prohibiting the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes and seeking to hold them responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 

  

pm usa usstc and other altria group inc subsidiaries are subject to and may become subject to regulation by the fda as discussed further in tobacco space – business environment – fda regulation in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2010 annual report we cannot predict how the fda will implement and enforce its statutory authority including by promulgating additional regulations and pursuing possible investigatory or enforcement actions 

  

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels actions by the fda or other federal state or local governments or agencies may impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products limit adult consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products restrict communications to adult consumers restrict the ability to differentiate tobacco products create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing labeling or packing requirements require the recall or removal of tobacco products from the marketplace or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business all or any of which may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations or financial condition of altria group inc 

  

excise taxes  tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our tobacco products due to lower consumption levels and to a potential shift in consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products for further discussion see tobacco space – business environment – excise taxes in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2010 annual report 

  

increased competition in the united states tobacco categories  each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category both from existing competitors and new entrants and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands in the cigar category additional competition has resulted from increased imports of machinemade large cigars manufactured offshore 

  

governmental investigations  from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations and it is possible that our subsidiaries’ businesses could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations 

  

new tobacco product technologies  altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new tobacco product technologies that may reduce the health 

  

risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers products that meet their taste expectations potential solutions being researched include tobacco products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors does our subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers or whether consumers’ purchase decisions would be affected by such claims which could affect the commercial viability of any tobacco products that might be developed 

  

adjacency strategy  altria group inc and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful 

  

tobacco price availability and quality  any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for a discussion of factors that influence leaf prices availability and quality see tobacco space – business environment – tobacco price availability and quality in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2010 annual report 

  

tobacco key facilities supply security  altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing facilities of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries or the facilities of any significant suppliers of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended interruption in operations experienced by one or more altria group inc subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of altria group inc 

  

attracting and retaining talent  our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result our tobacco subsidiaries may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

  

competition evolving consumer preferences and economic downturns  each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and changes in economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products the volumes of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

  

acquisitions  altria group inc from time to time considers acquisitions from time to time we may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our credit ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our credit ratings or the outlook for those ratings furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  

capital markets  access to the capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the capital markets and any resulting tightening of credit availability pricing andor credit terms may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

  

exchange rates  for purposes of financial reporting the equity earnings attributable to altria group inc’s investment in sabmiller are translated into us dollars from various local currencies based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported equity earnings in sabmiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer us dollars 

  

asset impairment  we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by general economic conditions regulatory developments changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences success of planned new product introductions competitive activity and tobaccorelated taxes if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings for further discussion see critical accounting policies and estimates – depreciation amortization and intangible asset valuation in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2010 annual report  

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the internal revenue service has challenged the tax treatment of certain of pmcc’s leveraged leases should altria group inc not prevail in any one or more of these matters altria group inc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax pay associated interest costs and penalties if imposed and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year for further discussion see note 21 and item 3 

  

wine – competition grape supply regulation and excise taxes  ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished national and international organizations the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington state supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and 

  

advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment – business environment in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2010 annual report

the property in richmond virginia that serves as the headquarters facility for altria group inc pm usa usstc and middleton and certain other subsidiaries is under lease

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contraband shipments patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of distributors 

  

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated and other litigation are or can be significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit 

  

bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome in certain cases plaintiffs claim that defendants’ liability is joint and several in such cases altria group inc or its subsidiaries may face the risk that one or more codefendants decline or otherwise fail to participate in the bonding required for an appeal or to pay their proportionate or juryallocated share of a judgment as a result altria group inc or its subsidiaries under certain circumstances may have to pay more than their proportionate share of any bonding or judgmentrelated amounts 

  

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 43 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all as discussed below however tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of florida’s bond cap statute in several cases and plaintiffs may challenge other state bond cap statutes although we cannot predict the outcome of such challenges it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome of one or more such challenges 

  

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings  i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

  

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so

engle class action 

  

in july 2000 in the second phase of the engle smoking and health class action in florida a jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages totaling approximately 145 billion against various defendants including 74 billion against pm usa following entry of judgment pm usa posted a bond in the amount of 100 million and appealed 

  

in may 2001 the trial court approved a stipulation providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the engle judgment will remain stayed against pm usa and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review as a result of the stipulation pm usa placed 500 million into a separate interestbearing escrow account that regardless of the outcome of the judicial review will be paid to the court and the court will determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with florida rules of civil procedure in july 2001 pm usa also placed 12 billion into an interestbearing escrow account which was returned to pm usa in december 2007 in 

  

addition the 100 million bond related to the case has been discharged in connection with the stipulation pm usa recorded a 500 million pretax charge in its consolidated statement of earnings for the quarter ended march 31 2001 in may 2003 the florida third district court of appeal reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class plaintiffs petitioned the florida supreme court for further review 

  

in july 2006 the florida supreme court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated that the class approved by the trial court be decertified and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate the court further declared the following phase i findings are entitled to res judicata effect in such individual actions brought within one year of the issuance of the mandate i that smoking causes various diseases ii that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive iii that defendants’ cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous iv that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking v that defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their detriment vi that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment vii that all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective and viii that defendants were negligent the court also reinstated compensatory damages awards totaling approximately 69 million to two individual plaintiffs and found that a third plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations in february 2008 pm usa paid a total of 2964685 which represents its share of compensatory damages and interest to the two individual plaintiffs identified in the florida supreme court’s order 

  

in august 2006 pm usa sought rehearing from the florida supreme court on parts of its july 2006 opinion including the ruling described above that certain jury findings have res judicata effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by engle class members the rehearing motion also asked among other things that legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the third district court of appeal or in the florida supreme court now be addressed plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in august 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability of the statute of limitations to nonmembers of the decertified class in december 2006 the florida supreme court refused to revise its july 2006 ruling except that it revised the set of phase i findings entitled to res judicata effect by excluding finding v listed above relating to agreement to misrepresent information and added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that at the time of sale or supply did not conform to the representations of fact made by defendants in january 2007 the florida supreme court issued the mandate from its revised opinion defendants then filed a motion with the florida third district court of appeal requesting that the court address legal errors that were previously raised by defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the third district court of appeal or by the florida supreme court in february 2007 the third district court of appeal denied defendants’ motion in may 2007 defendants’ motion for a partial stay of the mandate pending the completion of appellate review was denied by the third district court of appeal in may 2007 defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court in october 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition in november 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition for rehearing from the denial of their petition for writ of certiorari  

  

the deadline for filing engle progeny cases as required by the florida supreme court’s decision expired in january 2008 as of february 18 2011 approximately 7223 cases 3284 state court cases and 3939 federal court cases were pending against pm usa or altria group inc asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately 8890 plaintiffs 4952 state court plaintiffs and 3938 federal court plaintiffs it is possible that some of these cases are duplicates some of these cases have been removed from various florida state courts to the federal district courts in florida while others were filed 

  

in federal court in july 2007 pm usa and other defendants requested that the multidistrict litigation panel order the transfer of all such cases pending in the federal courts as well as any other engle progeny cases that may be filed to the middle district of florida for pretrial coordination the panel denied this request in december 2007 in october 2007 attorneys for plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate all pending and future cases filed in the state trial court in hillsborough county the court denied this motion in november 2007 in february 2008 the trial court decertified the class except for purposes of the may 2001 bond stipulation and formally vacated the punitive damages award pursuant to the florida supreme court’s mandate in april 2008 the trial court ruled that certain defendants including pm usa lacked standing with respect to allocation of the funds escrowed under the may 2001 bond stipulation and will receive no credit at this time from the 500 million paid by pm usa against any future punitive damages awards in cases brought by former engle class members 

  

in may 2008 the trial court among other things decertified the limited class maintained for purposes of the may 2001 bond stipulation and in july 2008 severed the remaining plaintiffs’ claims except for those of howard engle the only remaining plaintiff in the engle case howard engle voluntarily dismissed his claims with prejudice in july 2008 attorneys for a putative former engle class member petitioned the florida supreme court to permit members of the engle class additional time to file individual lawsuits the florida supreme court denied this petition in january 2009 

  

federal engle progeny cases 

  

three federal district courts in the merlob  brown and burr cases ruled that the findings in the first phase of the engle proceedings cannot be used to satisfy elements of plaintiffs’ claims and two of those rulings  brown and burr  were certified by the trial court for interlocutory review the certification in both cases was granted by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit and the appeals were consolidated in february 2009 the appeal in burr was dismissed for lack of prosecution in july 2010 the eleventh circuit ruled that plaintiffs do not have an unlimited right to use the findings from the original engle trial to meet their burden of establishing the elements of their claims at trial rather plaintiffs may only use the findings to establish those specific facts if any that they demonstrate with a reasonable degree of certainty were actually decided by the original engle jury the eleventh circuit remanded the case to the district court to determine what specific factual findings the engle jury actually made engle progeny cases pending in the federal district courts in the middle district of florida asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately 4420 plaintiffs had been stayed pending the eleventh circuit’s review on december 22 2010 stays were lifted in 12 cases selected by plaintiffs and notices of voluntary dismissals of approximately 500 cases have been granted the remaining cases are currently stayed 

  

florida bond cap statute 

  

in june 2009 florida amended its existing bond cap statute by adding a 200 million bond cap that applies to all engle progeny lawsuits in the aggregate and establishes individual bond caps for individual engle progeny cases in amounts that vary depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time the legislation which became effective in june 2009 applies to judgments entered after the effective date and remains in effect until december 31 2012 plaintiffs in three engle progeny cases against rj reynolds in alachua county florida  alexander  townsend and hall  and one case in escambia county  clay  have challenged the constitutionality of the bond cap statute the florida attorney general has intervened in these cases in defense of the constitutionality of the statute argument in these cases was heard in september 2010 plaintiffs in one engle progeny case against pm usa and rj reynolds in hillsborough county  douglas  have also challenged the constitutionality of the bond cap statute on january 4 2011 the trial court in escambia county rejected plaintiffs’ bond cap statute challenge and declared the statute constitutional in the clay case

scott class action 

  

in july 2003 following the first phase of the trial in the scott class action in which plaintiffs sought creation of a fund to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs a louisiana jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants including pm usa in connection with plaintiffs’ medical monitoring claims but also found that plaintiffs could benefit from smoking cessation assistance the jury also found that cigarettes as designed are not defective but that the defendants failed to disclose 

  

all they knew about smoking and diseases and marketed their products to minors in may 2004 in the second phase of the trial the jury awarded plaintiffs approximately 590 million against all defendants jointly and severally to fund a 10year smoking cessation program 

  

in june 2004 the court entered judgment which awarded plaintiffs the approximately 590 million jury award plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date the suit commenced pm usa’s share of the jury award and prejudgment interest has not been allocated defendants including pm usa appealed pursuant to a stipulation of the parties the trial court entered an order setting the amount of the bond at 50 million for all defendants in accordance with an article of the louisiana code of civil procedure and a louisiana statute the “bond cap law” fixing the amount of security in civil cases involving a signatory to the msa under the terms of the stipulation plaintiffs reserve the right to contest at a later date the sufficiency or amount of the bond on any grounds including the applicability or constitutionality of the bond cap law in september 2004 defendants collectively posted a bond in the amount of 50 million 125 million of which was posted by pm usa 

  

in february 2007 the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal issued a ruling on defendants’ appeal that among other things affirmed class certification but limited the scope of the class struck certain of the categories of damages included in the judgment reducing the amount of the award by approximately 312 million vacated the award of prejudgment interest which totaled approximately 444 million as of february 15 2007 and ruled that the only class members who are eligible to participate in the smoking cessation program are those who began smoking before and whose claims accrued by september 1 1988 as a result the louisiana court of appeal remanded the case for proceedings consistent with its opinion including further reduction of the amount of the award based on the size of the new class in march 2007 the louisiana court of appeal rejected defendants’ motion for rehearing and clarification in january 2008 the louisiana supreme court denied plaintiffs’ and defendants’ petitions for writ of certiorari  in march 2008 plaintiffs filed a motion to execute the approximately 279 million judgment plus postjudgment interest or in the alternative for an order to the parties to submit revised damages figures defendants filed a motion to have judgment entered in favor of defendants based on accrual of all class member claims after september 1 1988 or in the alternative for the entry of a case management order in april 2008 the louisiana supreme court denied defendants’ motion to stay proceedings and the defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court in june 2008 the united states supreme court denied the defendants’ petition plaintiffs filed a motion to enter judgment in the amount of approximately 280 million subsequently changed to approximately 264 million and defendants filed a motion to enter judgment in their favor dismissing the case entirely or alternatively to enter a case management order for a new trial in july 2008 the trial court entered an amended judgment and reasons for judgment denying both motions but ordering defendants to deposit into the registry of the court the sum of 263532762 plus postjudgment interest

health care cost recovery litigation 

  

overview 

  

in health care cost recovery litigation governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  

the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  

defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  

although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and eight state appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals 

  

in march 1999 in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial an ohio jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts in addition a 178 million verdict against defendants including 68 million against pm usa was reversed in a health care cost recovery case in new york and all claims were dismissed with prejudice in february 2005  blue crossblue shield  

  

in the health care cost recovery case brought by the city of st louis missouri and approximately 40 missouri hospitals in which pm usa usstc and altria group inc are defendants  city of st louis  the trial court in july 2010 granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to certain of plaintiffs’ claims on the grounds that they were preempted the court had earlier denied a number of other summary judgment motions by defendants and denied plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment claiming collateral estoppel from the findings in the case brought by the department of justice see federal government’s lawsuit described below the court also had previously granted defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment on plaintiffs’ claim for future damages although on november 29 2010 the trial court ruled that the damages period for the case would extend through december 31 2010 in september 2010 the trial court denied several of defendants’ summary judgment motions but granted defendants’ motion seeking to prevent plaintiffs from recovering the “present value” of their damages which are alleged to amount to approximately 300 million in october 2010 the trial court granted defendants summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs’ fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims trial began on january 10 2011 

  

individuals and associations have also sued in purported class actions or as private attorneys general under the medicare as secondary payer “msp” provisions of the social security act to recover from defendants medicare expenditures allegedly incurred for the treatment of smokingrelated diseases cases brought in new york  mason  florida  glover  and massachusetts  united seniors association  have been dismissed by federal courts in april 2008 an action national committee to preserve social security and medicare et al v philip morris usa et al “ national committee i ” was brought under the msp statute in the circuit court of the eleventh judicial circuit of and for miami county florida but was dismissed voluntarily in may 2008 the action purported to be brought on behalf of medicare to recover an unspecified amount of damages equal to double the amount paid by medicare for smokingrelated health care services provided from april 19 2002 to the present 

  

in may 2008 an action national committee to preserve social security et al v philip morris usa et al  was brought under the msp statute in united states district court for the eastern district of new york this action was brought by the same plaintiffs as national committee i and similarly purports to be brought on behalf of medicare to recover an unspecified amount of damages equal to double the amount paid by medicare for smokingrelated health care services provided from may 21 2002 to the present in july 2008 defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims and plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment in march 2009 the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs noticed an appeal in may 2009 in february 2010 defendants moved to dismiss the individual plaintiff’s appeal in october 2010 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit dismissed plaintiffs’ complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the plaintiffs subsequently filed a petition for rehearing en banc with the court of appeals which petition was denied on november 22 2010 on december 22 2010 the district court entered an order dismissing the case plaintiffs have advised that they will not seek further review of the decision 

  

in addition to the cases brought in the united states health care cost recovery actions have also been brought against tobacco industry participants including pm usa and altria group inc in israel 1 the marshall islands dismissed and canada 3 and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions in the case in israel the defendants’ appeal of the district court’s denial of their motion to dismiss was heard by the israel supreme court in march 2005 and the parties are awaiting the court’s decision in september 2005 in the first of the three health care cost recovery cases filed in canada the canadian supreme court ruled that legislation passed in british columbia 

  

permitting the lawsuit is constitutional and as a result the case which had previously been dismissed by the trial court was permitted to proceed pm usa’s and other defendants’ challenge to the british columbia court’s exercise of jurisdiction was rejected by the court of appeals of british columbia and in april 2007 the supreme court of canada denied review of that decision in december 2009 the court of appeals of british columbia ruled that certain defendants can proceed against the federal government of canada as third parties on the theory that the federal government of canada negligently misrepresented to defendants the efficacy of a low tar tobacco variety that the federal government of canada developed and licensed to defendants in may 2010 the supreme court of canada granted leave to the federal government of canada to appeal this decision and leave to defendants to crossappeal the court of appeals’ decision to dismiss claims against the federal government of canada based on other theories of liability the supreme court of canada is scheduled to hear the appeal on or about february 24 2011 during 2008 the province of new brunswick canada proclaimed into law previously adopted legislation allowing reimbursement claims to be brought against cigarette manufacturers and it filed suit shortly thereafter in september 2009 the province of ontario canada filed suit against a number of cigarette manufacturers based on previously adopted legislation nearly identical in substance to the new brunswick health care cost recovery legislation pm usa is named as a defendant in the british columbia case while altria group inc and pm usa are named as defendants in the new brunswick and ontario cases several other provinces and territories in canada have enacted similar legislation or are in the process of enacting similar legislation see “ guarantees ” for a discussion of the distribution agreement between altria group inc and pmi that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products 

  

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  

in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the original participating manufacturers make substantial annual payments of approximately 94 billion each year subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume in addition the original participating manufacturers are required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the state settlement agreements and the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was approximately 48 billion and 50 billion respectively 

  

the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  

possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003 to 2009 

  

pursuant to the provisions of the msa domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa who are original signatories to the msa the “original participating manufacturers” or “opms” are participating in proceedings that may result in downward adjustments to the amounts paid by the opms and the other msaparticipating manufacturers to the states and territories that are parties to the msa for each of the years 2003 to 2009 the proceedings relate to an msa payment adjustment the “npm adjustment” based on the collective loss of market share for the relevant year by all 

  

participating manufacturers who are subject to the payment obligations and marketing restrictions of the msa to nonparticipating manufacturers “npms” who are not subject to such obligations and restrictions 

  

as part of these proceedings an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the msa parties or otherwise selected pursuant to the msa’s provisions is required to determine whether the disadvantages of the msa were a “significant factor” contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year in question if the firm determines that the disadvantages of the msa were such a “significant factor” each state may avoid a downward adjustment to its share of the participating manufacturers’ annual payments for that year by establishing that it diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during the entirety of that year any potential downward adjustment would then be reallocated to any states that do not establish such diligent enforcement pm usa believes that the msa’s arbitration clause requires a state to submit its claim to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute to binding arbitration before a panel of three former federal judges in the manner provided for in the msa a number of states have taken the position that this claim should be decided in state court on a statebystate basis 

  

in march 2006 an independent economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2003 in february 2007 this same firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2004 in february 2008 the same economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2005 a different economic consulting firm was selected to make the “significant factor” determination regarding the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2006 in march 2009 this firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2006 following the firm’s determination for 2006 the opms and the states agreed that the states would not contest that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the years 2007 2008 and 2009 accordingly the opms and the states have agreed that no “significant factor” determination by the firm will be necessary with respect to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the years 2007 2008 and 2009 this agreement became effective for 2007 and 2008 on february 1 2010 and february 1 2011 respectively and will become effective for 2009 on february 1 2012 

  

following the economic consulting firm’s determination with respect to 2003 thirtyeight states filed declaratory judgment actions in state courts seeking a declaration that the state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers responded to these actions by filing motions to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the msa including filing motions to compel arbitration in eleven msa states and territories that did not file declaratory judgment actions courts in all but one of the fortysix msa states and the district of columbia and puerto rico have ruled that the question of whether a state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 is subject to arbitration one state court in state of montana  has ruled that the diligent enforcement claims of that state may be litigated in state court rather than in arbitration several of these rulings may be subject to further review in january 2010 the opms filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking further review of the one decision holding that a state’s diligent enforcement claims may be litigated in state court rather than in arbitration the petition was denied in june 2010 following the denial of this petition montana renewed an action in its state court seeking a declaratory judgment that it diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 and other relief the opms moved to stay that action and on january 28 2011 the state court granted the opms’ motion 

  

pm usa the other opms and approximately twentyfive other msaparticipating manufacturers have entered into an agreement regarding arbitration with fortyfive msa states concerning the 2003 npm adjustment including the states’ claims of diligent enforcement for 2003 the agreement further provides for a partial liability reduction for the 2003 npm adjustment for states that entered into the agreement by january 30 2009 and are determined in the arbitration not to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during 2003 based on the number of states that entered into the agreement by january 30 2009 fortyfive the partial liability reduction for those states is 20 the partial liability reduction would reduce the amount of pm usa’s 2003 npm adjustment by up to a corresponding percentage the selection of the arbitration panel for the 2003 npm adjustment was completed in july 2010 and the arbitration is currently ongoing proceedings to determine state diligent enforcement claims for the years 2004 through 2009 have not yet been scheduled 

  

once a significant factor determination in favor of the participating manufacturers for a particular year has been made by the economic consulting firm or the states’ agreement not to contest significant factor for a particular year has become effective pm usa has the right under the msa to pay the disputed amount of the npm adjustment for that year into a disputed payments account or withhold it altogether to date pm usa has made its full msa payment each year to the states subject to a right to recoup the npm adjustment amount in the form of a credit against future msa payments even though it had the right to deduct the disputed amounts of the 2003 – 2007 npm adjustments as described above from its msa payments due in the years 2006 – 2010 respectively the approximate maximum principal amounts of pm usa’s share of the disputed npm adjustment for the years 2003 through 2009 as currently calculated by the msa’s independent auditor are as follows these amounts do not include interest which pm usa believes accrues at the prime rate from the payment date for the year for which the npm adjustment is calculated 

  

   

the foregoing amounts may be recalculated by the independent auditor if it receives information that is different from or in addition to the information on which it based these calculations including among other things if it receives revised sales volumes from any participating manufacturer disputes among the manufacturers could also reduce the foregoing amounts the availability and the precise amount of any npm adjustment for 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2009 will not be finally determined until late 2011 or thereafter there is no certainty that the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers will ultimately receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings and the amount of any adjustment received for a year could be less than the amount for that year listed above if the opms do receive such an adjustment through these proceedings the adjustment would be allocated among the opms pursuant to the msa’s provisions and pm usa would receive its share of any adjustments in the form of a credit against future msa payments 

  

other msarelated litigation 

  

pm usa was named as a defendant in an action  vibo  brought in october 2008 in federal court in kentucky by an msa participating manufacturer that is not an opm other defendants include various other participating manufacturers and the attorneys general of all 52 states and territories that are parties to the msa the plaintiff alleged that certain of the msa’s payment provisions discriminate against it in favor of certain other participating manufacturers in violation of the federal antitrust laws and the united states constitution the plaintiff also sought injunctive relief alteration of certain msa 

  

payment provisions as applied to it treble damages under the federal antitrust laws andor rescission of its joinder in the msa the plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the states from enforcing the allegedly discriminatory payment provisions against it during the pendency of the action in january 2009 the district court dismissed the complaint and denied plaintiff’s request for preliminary injunctive relief in january 2010 the court entered final judgment dismissing the case plaintiff has appealed this decision to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 

  

without naming pm usa or any other private party as a defendant npms andor their distributors or customers have filed several legal challenges to the msa and related legislation new york state officials are defendants in a lawsuit  freedom holdings  filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in which cigarette importers allege that the msa andor related legislation violates federal antitrust laws and the commerce clause of the united states constitution in a separate proceeding pending in the same court  pryor  plaintiffs assert the same theories against not only new york officials but also the attorneys general for thirty other states the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has held that the allegations in both actions if proven establish a basis for relief on antitrust and commerce clause grounds and that the trial courts in new york have personal jurisdiction sufficient to enjoin other states’ officials from enforcing their msarelated legislation on remand in freedom holdings  the trial court granted summary judgment for the new york officials and lifted a preliminary injunction against new york officials’ enforcement against plaintiffs of the state’s “allocable share” amendment to the msa’s model escrow statute the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed that decision in october 2010 plaintiffs petitioned the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari on january 20 2011 on remand in pryor  the trial court held that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits and refused to enjoin the enforcement of new york’s allocable share amendment to the msa’s model escrow statute that decision was affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit the parties in that case have filed crossmotions for summary judgment and the trial court heard oral argument on those motions in april 2010 

  

in another action  xcaliber  the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed a trial court’s dismissal of challenges to msarelated legislation in louisiana under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution on remand in that case and in another case filed against the louisiana attorney general  sm brands  trial courts have granted summary judgment for the louisiana attorney general the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed those judgments in decisions issued in july 2010 and august 2010 plaintiffs in the sm brands case filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court on november 8 2010 

  

in addition to the second and fifth circuit decisions above the united states courts of appeals for the sixth eighth ninth and tenth circuits have affirmed dismissals or grants of summary judgment in favor of state officials in four other cases asserting antitrust and constitutional challenges to the allocable share amendment legislation in those states 

  

another proceeding  grand river  has been initiated before an international arbitration tribunal under the provisions of the north american free trade agreement a hearing on the merits concluded in february 2010 on january 12 2011 the arbitration tribunal rejected the claims against the united states challenging msarelated legislation in various states 

  

federal government’s lawsuit 

  

in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others including altria group inc asserting claims under three federal statutes namely the medical care recovery act “mcra” the msp provisions of the social security act and the civil provisions of rico trial of the

the government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2004 the trial court issued an order denying defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy in february 2005 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under the civil provisions of rico and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim in april 2005 the court of appeals denied the government’s motion for rehearing in july 2005 the government petitioned the united states supreme court for further review of the court of appeals’ ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy and in october 2005 the supreme court denied the petition 

  

in june 2005 the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment seeking remedies of approximately 14 billion including 10 billion over a fiveyear period to fund a national smoking cessation program and 4 billion over a tenyear period to fund a public education and countermarketing campaign further the government’s proposed remedy would have required defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 are not achieved according to a prescribed timetable the government’s proposed remedies also included a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business operations—including but not limited to restrictions on advertising and marketing potential measures with respect to certain price promotional activities and research and development disclosure requirements for certain confidential data and implementation of a monitoring system with potential broad powers over cigarette operations

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services 

  

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts including coupons product promotions and allowances for new products the tobacco products of altria group inc’s subsidiaries are advertised and promoted through various media although television and radio advertising of certain tobacco products is prohibited in the united states in addition as discussed below in item 3 legal proceedings  pm usa usstc and other us tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

  

in the united states under a contract growing program pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers under the terms of this program pm usa agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts pm usa also purchases its united states tobacco requirements through other sources in 2003 pm usa and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quotaholders the agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant including pm usa to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from us tobacco growers over a period of at least ten years these quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement 

  

tobacco production in the united states was historically subject to government controls including the production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provided for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quotaholders the cost of the buyout which is estimated at approximately 95 billion is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the quota buyout payments offset already scheduled payments to the national tobacco grower settlement trust the “ntgst” pm usa usstc and middleton are all subject to obligations imposed by fetra see item 3 legal proceedings  health care cost recovery litigation—national grower settlement trust for a discussion of the ntgst manufacturers and importers of tobacco products including the tobacco subsidiaries of altria group inc were also obligated to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government incurred on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program the quota buyout did not have a material impact on altria group inc’s 2009 

  

consolidated results and altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2010 and beyond 

  

usstc purchases burley dark firecured and aircured tobaccos of various grades and styles from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf dealers 

  

middleton purchases burley and fluecured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf dealers middleton does not have a contract growing program 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements 

  

wine 

  

altria group inc acquired ust and its premium wine business ste michelle in january 2009 ste michelle is a producer of premium varietal and blended table wines ste michelle is a leading producer of washington state wines primarily chateau ste michelle and columbia crest and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other wine regions  ste michelle holds an 85 ownership interest in michelleantinori llc which owns stag’s leap wine cellars in napa valley ste michelle also owns conn creek in napa valley and erath in oregon in addition ste michelle distributes antinori and villa maria estates wines and champagne nicolas feuillatte in the united states

the following table summarizes wine segment case shipment volume performance by brand volume for 2008 represents volume shipped by ste michelle prior to the ust acquisition 

  

   

in 2009 ste michelle’s retail volume as measured by nielsen total wine database—us food  drug increased 10 versus 2008 

  

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

a key element of ste michelle’s strategy is expanded domestic distribution of its wines especially in certain account categories such as restaurants wholesale clubs supermarkets wine shops and mass merchandisers 

  

ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including competition from many larger wellestablished domestic and international companies as well as from many smaller wine producers wine segment competition is primarily based on quality price consumer and trade wine tastings competitive wine judging thirdparty acclaim and advertising substantially all of ste michelle’s sales occur through statelicensed distributors 

  

federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business 

  

ste michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production at the present time ste michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report 

  

we  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to security holders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and 

   

outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2009 annual report you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time 

  

tobaccorelated litigation  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contraband shipments patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

  

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome 

  

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 43 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all 

  

altria group inc and its subsidiaries have achieved substantial success in managing litigation nevertheless litigation is subject to uncertainty and significant challenges remain it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts each of the companies has defended and will continue to defend vigorously against litigation challenges however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so see note 22 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements item 3 legal proceedings  and exhibit 991 for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

tobacco regulation and control action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use restricting marketing and advertising imposing regulations on packaging warnings and disclosure of flavors or other ingredients prohibiting the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors or other characteristics limiting or prohibiting the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes and seeking to hold them responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce consumption levels 

  

pm usa usstc and other altria group inc subsidiaries are now subject to extensive regulation by the fda as discussed further in tobacco space—business environment—fda regulation in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2009 annual report we cannot predict how the fda might implement and enforce its statutory authority including by promulgating additional regulations and pursuing possible enforcement actions but such implementation and enforcement may impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products limit adult consumer choices delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco products restrict communications to adult consumers create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies impose additional manufacturing requirements or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business all or any of which may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations or financial condition of altria group inc 

  

excise taxes  tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our tobacco products due to lower consumption levels and to a potential shift in consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products for further discussion see tobacco space—business environment—excise taxes in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2009 annual report 

  

increased competition in the united states tobacco categories  each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco category both from existing competitors and new entrants and has experienced consumer downtrading to lowerpriced brands 

  

governmental investigations  from time to time altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced or the outcome of such investigations and it is possible that our subsidiaries’ businesses could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations 

  

new tobacco product technologies  altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new tobacco product technologies that may reduce the health risks associated with current tobacco products while continuing to offer adult tobacco consumers products that meet their taste expectations potential solutions being researched include tobacco products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors does our subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators including the fda will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers or whether consumers’ purchase decisions would be affected by such claims which could affect the commercial viability of any tobacco products that might be developed 

  

adjacency strategy  altria group inc and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful 

  

tobacco price availability and quality  any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for a discussion of factors that influence leaf prices availability and quality see tobacco space—business environment—tobacco price availability and quality in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2009 annual report 

  

key facilities supply security  altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of significant suppliers a natural or manmade disaster or other disruption that affects the manufacturing facilities of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries or the facilities of any significant suppliers of any of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries could adversely impact the operations of the affected subsidiaries an extended interruption in operations experienced by one or more altria group inc subsidiaries or significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of altria group inc 

  

attracting and retaining talent  our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result our tobacco subsidiaries may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

  

competition and economic downturns  each of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and changes in economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the willingness of adult consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may purchase more discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lowerpriced tobacco products the volumes of our tobacco and wine subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

  

acquisitions  altria group inc from time to time considers acquisitions from time to time we may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our debt ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our debt ratings 

  

or the outlook for those ratings furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  

ust acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will achieve the synergies expected of the ust acquisition 

  

capital markets  access to the capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the capital markets and any resulting tightening of credit availability pricing andor credit terms may negatively affect the amount of credit available to us and may also increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

  

exchange rates  for purposes of financial reporting the equity earnings attributable to altria group inc’s investment in sabmiller are translated into us dollars from various local currencies based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar against these currencies our reported equity earnings in sabmiller will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer us dollars 

  

asset impairment  we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by the market conditions noted above as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings for further discussion see critical accounting policies and estimates—depreciation amortization and intangible asset valuation in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2009 annual report 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the internal revenue service has challenged the tax treatment of certain of pmcc’s leveraged leases should altria group inc not prevail in any one or more of these matters altria group inc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax pay associated interest costs and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year for further discussion see note 22 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements and item 3 legal proceedings  

  

wine—competition grape supply regulation and excise taxes  ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished national and international organizations the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington state supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business for further discussion see wine segment—business environment in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2009 annual report

engle class action 

  

in july 2000 in the second phase of the engle smoking and health class action in florida a jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages totaling approximately 145 billion against various defendants including 74 billion against pm usa following entry of judgment pm usa posted a bond in the amount of 100 million and appealed 

  

in may 2001 the trial court approved a stipulation providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the engle judgment will remain stayed against pm usa and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review as a result of the stipulation pm usa placed 500 million into a separate interestbearing escrow account that regardless of the outcome of the judicial review will be paid to the court and the court will determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with florida rules of civil procedure in july 2001 pm usa also placed 12 billion into an interestbearing escrow account which was returned to pm usa in december 2007 in addition the 100 million bond related to the case has been discharged in connection with the stipulation pm usa recorded a 500 million pretax charge in its consolidated statement of earnings for the quarter ended march 31 2001 in may 2003 the florida third district court of appeal reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class plaintiffs petitioned the florida supreme court for further review 

  

in july 2006 the florida supreme court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated that the class approved by the trial court be decertified and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate the court further declared the following phase i findings are entitled to res judicata effect in such individual actions brought within one year of the issuance of the mandate i that smoking causes various diseases ii that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive iii that defendants’ cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous iv that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking v that defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their detriment vi that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment vii that all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective and viii that defendants were negligent the court also reinstated compensatory damages awards totaling approximately 69 million to two individual plaintiffs and found that a third plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations in february 2008 pm usa paid a total of 2964685 which represents its share of compensatory damages and interest to the two individual plaintiffs identified in the florida supreme court’s order 

  

in august 2006 pm usa sought rehearing from the florida supreme court on parts of its july 2006 opinion including the ruling described above that certain jury findings have res judicata effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by engle class members the rehearing motion also asked among other things that legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the third district court of appeal or in the florida supreme court now be addressed plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in august 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability of the statute of limitations to nonmembers of the decertified class in december 2006 the florida supreme court refused to revise its july 2006 ruling except that it revised the set of phase i findings entitled to res judicata effect by excluding finding v listed above relating to agreement to misrepresent information and added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that at the time of sale or supply did not conform to the representations of fact made by defendants in january 2007 the florida supreme court issued the mandate from its revised opinion defendants then filed a motion with the florida third district court of appeal requesting that the court address legal errors that were previously raised by 

  

defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the third district court of appeal or by the florida supreme court in february 2007 the third district court of appeal denied defendants’ motion in may 2007 defendants’ motion for a partial stay of the mandate pending the completion of appellate review was denied by the third district court of appeal in may 2007 defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court in october 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition in november 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition for rehearing from the denial of their petition for writ of certiorari  

  

the deadline for filing engle progeny cases as required by the florida supreme court’s decision expired in january 2008 as of february 19 2010 approximately 7713 cases 3275 state court cases and 4438 federal court cases were pending against pm usa or altria group inc asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately 9522 plaintiffs 5086 state court plaintiffs and 4436 federal court plaintiffs it is possible that some of these cases are duplicates some of these cases have been removed from various florida state courts to the federal district courts in florida while others were filed in federal court in july 2007 pm usa and other defendants requested that the multidistrict litigation panel order the transfer of all such cases pending in the federal courts as well as any other engle progeny cases that may be filed to the middle district of florida for pretrial coordination the panel denied this request in december 2007 in october 2007 attorneys for plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate all pending and future cases filed in the state trial court in hillsborough county the court denied this motion in november 2007 in february 2008 the trial court decertified the class except for purposes of the may 2001 bond stipulation and formally vacated the punitive damages award pursuant to the florida supreme court’s mandate in april 2008 the trial court ruled that certain defendants including pm usa lacked standing with respect to allocation of the funds escrowed under the may 2001 bond stipulation and will receive no credit at this time from the 500 million paid by pm usa against any future punitive damages awards in cases brought by former engle class members 

  

in may 2008 the trial court among other things decertified the limited class maintained for purposes of the may 2001 bond stipulation and in july 2008 severed the remaining plaintiffs’ claims except for those of howard engle the only remaining plaintiff in the engle case howard engle voluntarily dismissed his claims with prejudice in july 2008 attorneys for a putative former engle class member petitioned the florida supreme court to permit members of the engle class additional time to file individual lawsuits the florida supreme court denied this petition in january 2009 

  

three federal district courts in the merlob brown and burr cases have ruled that the findings in the first phase of the engle proceedings cannot be used to satisfy elements of plaintiffs’ claims and two of those rulings brown and burr have been certified by the trial court for interlocutory review the certification in both cases has been granted by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit and the appeals have been consolidated argument was held on january 26 2010 in february 2009 the appeal in burr was dismissed for lack of prosecution engle progeny cases pending in the federal district courts in the middle district of florida asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately 4436 plaintiffs have been stayed pending interlocutory review by the eleventh circuit state trial court judges have issued contrary rulings that allowed plaintiffs to use the engle findings to establish elements of their claims and required certain defenses to be stricken 

  

in june 2009 florida amended its existing bond cap statute by adding a 200 million bond cap that applies to all engle progeny lawsuits in the aggregate and establishes individual bond caps for individual engle progeny cases in amounts that vary depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time the legislation which became effective in june 2009 applies to judgments entered after the effective date and remains in effect until december 31 2012 

  

as of february 19 2010 six engle progeny cases involving pm usa have resulted in verdicts since the florida supreme court engle decision four verdicts see hess barbanell campbell and 

  

naugle descriptions in the table above were returned in favor of plaintiffs and two verdicts were returned in favor of pm usa  gelep and kalyvas  the plaintiff in gelep initially appealed the defense verdict but in september 2009 voluntarily dismissed her appeal engle progeny trial results are included in the totals provided in trial results above  

  

on january 12 2010 the plaintiff in the j cohen case voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice during trial after accepting pm usa’s offer of judgment in the amount of 1000 

  

scott class action 

  

in july 2003 following the first phase of the trial in the scott class action in which plaintiffs sought creation of a fund to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs a louisiana jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants including pm usa in connection with plaintiffs’ medical monitoring claims but also found that plaintiffs could benefit from smoking cessation assistance the jury also found that cigarettes as designed are not defective but that the defendants failed to disclose all they knew about smoking and diseases and marketed their products to minors in may 2004 in the second phase of the trial the jury awarded plaintiffs approximately 590 million against all defendants jointly and severally to fund a 10year smoking cessation program 

  

in june 2004 the court entered judgment which awarded plaintiffs the approximately 590 million jury award plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date the suit commenced pm usa’s share of the jury award and prejudgment interest has not been allocated defendants including pm usa appealed pursuant to a stipulation of the parties the trial court entered an order setting the amount of the bond at 50 million for all defendants in accordance with an article of the louisiana code of civil procedure and a louisiana statute the “bond cap law” fixing the amount of security in civil cases involving a signatory to the msa under the terms of the stipulation plaintiffs reserve the right to contest at a later date the sufficiency or amount of the bond on any grounds including the applicability or constitutionality of the bond cap law in september 2004 defendants collectively posted a bond in the amount of 50 million 

  

in february 2007 the louisiana court of appeal issued a ruling on defendants’ appeal that among other things affirmed class certification but limited the scope of the class struck certain of the categories of damages included in the judgment reducing the amount of the award by approximately 312 million vacated the award of prejudgment interest which totaled approximately 444 million as of february 15 2007 and ruled that the only class members who are eligible to participate in the smoking cessation program are those who began smoking before and whose claims accrued by september 1 1988 as a result the louisiana court of appeal remanded the case for proceedings consistent with its opinion including further reduction of the amount of the award based on the size of the new class in march 2007 the louisiana court of appeal rejected defendants’ motion for rehearing and clarification in january 2008 the louisiana supreme court denied plaintiffs’ and defendants’ petitions for writ of certiorari  following the louisiana supreme court’s denial of defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari  pm usa recorded a provision of 26 million in connection with the case and has recorded additional provisions of approximately 49 million related to accrued interest in march 2008 plaintiffs filed a motion to execute the approximately 279 million judgment plus postjudgment interest or in the alternative for an order to the parties to submit revised damages figures defendants filed a motion to have judgment entered in favor of defendants based on accrual of all class member claims after september 1 1988 or in the alternative for the entry of a case management order in april 2008 the louisiana supreme court denied defendants’ motion to stay proceedings and the defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court in june 2008 the united states supreme court denied the defendant’s petition plaintiffs filed a motion to enter judgment in the amount of approximately 280 million subsequently changed to approximately 264 million and defendants filed a motion to enter judgment in their favor dismissing the case entirely or alternatively 

  

to enter a case management order for a new trial in july 2008 the trial court entered an amended judgment and reasons for judgment denying both motions but ordering defendants to deposit into the registry of the court the sum of 263532762 plus postjudgment interest which is approximately 107 million as of february 19 2010 while stating however that the judgment award “may be satisfied with something less than a full cash payment now” and that the court would “favorably consider” returning unused funds annually to defendants if monies allocated for that year were not fully expended 

  

in september 2008 defendants filed an application for writ of mandamus or supervisory writ to secure the right to appeal with the louisiana circuit court of appeals the appellate court in november 2008 granted the defendants’ writ and directed the trial court to enter an order permitting the appeal and to set the appeal bond in accordance with louisiana law in december 2008 plaintiffs’ supervisory writ petition to the louisiana supreme court was denied and the trial court entered an order permitting the appeal and approving a 50 million bond for all defendants in accordance with the louisiana bond cap law discussed above in april 2009 plaintiffs filed a crossappeal seeking to reinstate the june 2004 judgment and to award the medical monitoring rejected by the jury argument before the louisiana court of appeal fourth circuit was held in september 2009 

  

smoking and health litigation 

  

overview 

  

plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in smoking and health cases are based on various theories of recovery including negligence gross negligence strict liability fraud misrepresentation design defect failure to warn nuisance breach of express and implied warranties breach of special duty conspiracy concert of action violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes and claims under the federal and state antiracketeering statutes plaintiffs in the smoking and health actions seek various forms of relief including compensatory and punitive damages treblemultiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds disgorgement of profits and injunctive and equitable relief defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause assumption of the risk comparative fault andor contributory negligence statutes of limitations and preemption by the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act 

  

in july 2008 the new york supreme court appellate division first department in fabiano  an individual personal injury case held that plaintiffs’ punitive damages claim was barred by the msa as defined below based on principles of res judicata because the new york attorney general had already litigated the punitive damages claim on behalf of all new york residents in august 2008 plaintiffs filed a motion for permission to appeal to the court of appeals the motion was denied in november 2008 

  

smoking and health class actions 

  

since the dismissal in may 1996 of a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of allegedly addicted smokers plaintiffs have filed numerous putative smoking and health class action suits in various state and federal courts in general these cases purport to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or states although a few cases purport to be nationwide in scope and raise addiction claims and in many cases claims of physical injury as well

health care cost recovery litigation 

  

overview 

  

in health care cost recovery litigation governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  

the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  

defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  

although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and six state appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals 

  

in march 1999 in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial an ohio jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts in addition a 178 million verdict against defendants including 68 million against pm usa was reversed in a health care cost recovery case in new york and all claims were dismissed with prejudice in february 2005  blue crossblue shield  in june 2009 the trial court denied two of defendants’ motions for summary judgment in a health care cost recovery case brought by the city of st louis missouri and approximately 40 missouri hospitals in which pm usa usstc and altria group inc are defendants defendants’ other summary judgment motions as well as plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment claiming collateral estoppel from the findings in the case brought by the department of justice see federal government’s lawsuit described below are still pending trial is currently scheduled to begin no earlier than january 2011 

  

individuals and associations have also sued in purported class actions or as private attorneys general under the medicare as secondary payer “msp” provisions of the social security act to 

  

recover from defendants medicare expenditures allegedly incurred for the treatment of smokingrelated diseases cases brought in new york mason   florida glover and massachusetts united seniors association have been dismissed by federal courts in april 2008 an action national committee to preserve social security and medicare et al v philip morris usa et al “national committee i” was brought under the msp statute in the circuit court of the eleventh judicial circuit of and for miami county florida but was dismissed voluntarily in may 2008 the action purported to be brought on behalf of medicare to recover an unspecified amount of damages equal to double the amount paid by medicare for smokingrelated health care services provided from april 19 2002 to the present 

  

in may 2008 an action national committee to preserve social security et al v philip morris usa et al  was brought under the msp statute in united states district court for the eastern district of new york this action was brought by the same plaintiffs as national committee i and similarly purports to be brought on behalf of medicare to recover an unspecified amount of damages equal to double the amount paid by medicare for smokingrelated health care services provided from may 21 2002 to the present in july 2008 defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims and plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment in march 2009 the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs noticed an appeal in may 2009 after the district court denied their motion for reconsideration 

  

in addition to the cases brought in the united states health care cost recovery actions have also been brought against tobacco industry participants including pm usa in israel 1 the marshall islands 1 dismissed and canada 3 and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions in september 2005 in the first of the three health care recovery cases filed in canada the canadian supreme court ruled that legislation passed in british columbia permitting the lawsuit is constitutional and as a result the case which had previously been dismissed by the trial court was permitted to proceed pm usa’s and other defendants’ challenge to the british columbia court’s exercise of jurisdiction was rejected by the court of appeals of british columbia and in april 2007 the supreme court of canada denied review of that decision during 2008 the province of new brunswick canada proclaimed into law previously adopted legislation allowing reimbursement claims to be brought against cigarette manufacturers and it filed suit shortly thereafter in september 2009 the province of ontario canada filed suit against a number of cigarette manufacturers based on previously adopted legislation nearly identical in substance to the new brunswick health care cost recovery legislation pm usa is named as a defendant in the british columbia case while altria group inc and pm usa are named as defendants in the new brunswick and ontario cases several other provinces in canada have enacted similar legislation or are in the process of enacting similar legislation see “guarantees” for a discussion of the distribution agreement between altria group inc and pmi that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products 

  

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  

in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the msa with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the original participating manufacturers make substantial annual payments of approximately 94 billion each year excluding future annual payments if any under the national tobacco grower settlement trust discussed below subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume in addition the original participating manufacturers are required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 the aggregate amount 

  

recorded in cost of sales with respect to the state settlement agreements and the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was approximately 50 billion and 55 billion respectively 

  

the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  

possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003 to 2008 

  

pursuant to the provisions of the msa domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa who are original signatories to the msa the “original participating manufacturers” or “opms” are participating in proceedings that may result in downward adjustments to the amounts paid by the opms and the other msaparticipating manufacturers to the states and territories that are parties to the msa for each of the years 2003 to 2008 the proceedings relate to an msa payment adjustment the “npm adjustment” based on the collective loss of market share for the relevant year by all participating manufacturers who are subject to the payment obligations and marketing restrictions of the msa to nonparticipating manufacturers “npms” who are not subject to such obligations and restrictions 

  

as part of these proceedings an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the msa parties or otherwise selected pursuant to the msa’s provisions is required to determine whether the disadvantages of the msa were a “significant factor” contributing to the collective loss of market share for the year in question if the firm determines that the disadvantages of the msa were such a “significant factor” each state may avoid a downward adjustment to its share of the participating manufacturers’ annual payments for that year by establishing that it diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during the entirety of that year any potential downward adjustment would then be reallocated to any states that do not establish such diligent enforcement pm usa believes that the msa’s arbitration clause requires a state to submit its claim to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute to binding arbitration before a panel of three former federal judges in the manner provided for in the msa a number of states have taken the position that this claim should be decided in state court on a statebystate basis 

  

in march 2006 an independent economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2003 in february 2007 this same firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2004 in february 2008 the same economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2005 a different economic consulting firm was selected to make the “significant factor” determination regarding the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2006 in march 2009 this firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2006 following the firm’s determination for 2006 the opms and the states agreed that the states will not contest that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the years 2007 and 2008 and 2009 if the participating manufacturers collectively sustain a sufficient loss of market share for that year as well accordingly the opms and the states have agreed that no “significant factor” determination by the firm will be necessary with respect to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the years 2007 2008 and 2009 

  

following the economic consulting firm’s determination with respect to 2003 thirtyeight states filed declaratory judgment actions in state courts seeking a declaration that the state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers responded to 

  

these actions by filing motions to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the msa including filing motions to compel arbitration in eleven msa states and territories that did not file declaratory judgment actions courts in all but one of the fortysix msa states and the district of columbia and puerto rico have ruled that the question of whether a state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 is subject to arbitration one state court has ruled that the diligent enforcement claims of that state may be litigated in state court rather than in arbitration several of these rulings may be subject to further review pm usa the other opms and approximately twentyfive other msaparticipating manufacturers have entered into an agreement regarding arbitration with over forty msa states concerning the 2003 npm adjustment including the states’ claims of diligent enforcement for 2003 the selection of the arbitration panel for the 2003 npm adjustment is currently underway the agreement further provides for a partial liability reduction for the 2003 npm adjustment for states that entered into the agreement by january 30 2009 and are determined in the arbitration not to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during 2003 based on the number of states that entered into the agreement by january 30 2009 fortyfive the partial liability reduction for those states is 20 the partial liability reduction would reduce the amount of pm usa’s 2003 npm adjustment by up to a corresponding percentage proceedings to determine state diligent enforcement claims for the years 2004 through 2008 have not yet been scheduled 

  

the availability and the precise amount of any npm adjustment for 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 will not be finally determined until late 2010 or thereafter there is no certainty that the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers will ultimately receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings if the opms do receive such an adjustment through these proceedings the adjustment would be allocated among the opms pursuant to the msa’s provisions and pm usa’s share would likely be applied as a credit against future msa payments 

  

national grower settlement trust 

  

as part of the msa the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobaccogrowing states to address concerns about the potential adverse economic impact of the msa on tobacco growers and quota holders to that end in 1999 four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa established the national tobacco growers settlement trust “ntgst” a trust fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quota holders the ntgst was to be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments subject to application of various adjustments scheduled to total 515 billion provisions of the ntgst allowed for offsets to the extent that industryfunded payments were made for the benefit of growers or quota holders as part of a legislated end to the federal tobacco quota and price support program 

  

in october 2004 fetra was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout which is estimated at approximately 95 billion is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the quota buyout payments offset already scheduled payments to the ntgst in addition to the approximately 95 billion cost of the buyout fetra also obligated manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government incurred on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program pm usa middleton and usstc are subject to the requirements of fetra altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2009 and beyond 

  

two of the grower states maryland and pennsylvania filed claims in the north carolina state courts asserting that the companies which established the ntgst including pm usa must continue making payments under the ntgst through 2010 for the benefit of maryland and pennsylvania 

  

growers such continuing payments would represent slightly more than one percent of the originally scheduled payments that would have been due to the ntgst for the years 2005 through 2010 notwithstanding the offsets resulting from the fetra payments the north carolina trial court held in favor of maryland and pennsylvania and the companies including pm usa appealed the north carolina court of appeals in december 2008 reversed the trial court ruling and entered summary judgment in favor of the companies in january 2009 maryland and pennsylvania filed a notice of appeal to the north carolina supreme court on november 6 2009 the north carolina supreme court upheld the decision of the north carolina court of appeals ruling in favor of pm usa and the other companies the period for filing an appeal has elapsed concluding this litigation 

  

other msarelated litigation 

  

pm usa was named as a defendant in an action brought in october 2008 in federal court in kentucky by an msa participating manufacturer that is not an opm other defendants include various other participating manufacturers and the attorneys general of all 52 states and territories that are parties to the msa the plaintiff alleged that certain of the msa’s payment provisions discriminate against it in favor of certain other participating manufacturers in violation of the federal antitrust laws and the united states constitution the plaintiff also sought injunctive relief alteration of certain msa payment provisions as applied to it treble damages under the federal antitrust laws andor rescission of its joinder in the msa the plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the states from enforcing the allegedly discriminatory payment provisions against it during the pendency of the action in january 2009 the district court dismissed the complaint and denied plaintiff’s request for preliminary injunctive relief on january 5 2010 the court entered final judgment dismissing the case on january 13 2010 plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 

  

in december 2008 pm usa was named as a defendant in an action seeking declaratory relief under the msa the action was filed in california state court by the same msa participating manufacturer that filed the kentucky action discussed in the preceding paragraph other defendants included the state of california and various other participating manufacturers the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that its proposed amended adherence agreement with california and other states that are parties to the msa was consistent with provisions in the msa and that the msa’s limited most favored nations provision does not apply to the proposed agreement plaintiff sought no damages in this action in july 2009 the court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment and subsequently entered final judgment in favor of defendants on all claims asserted by plaintiff plaintiff then filed an appeal the state of california informed the plaintiff and the appeals court on november 17 2009 that it no longer intends to enter into the amended adherence agreement with the plaintiff as a result on december 23 2009 the participating manufacturer defendants including pm usa filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot on january 14 2010 plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the appeal concluding the litigation 

  

without naming pm usa or any other private party as a defendant npms andor their distributors or customers have filed several legal challenges to the msa and related legislation new york state officials are defendants in a lawsuit pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in which cigarette importers allege that the msa andor related legislation violates federal antitrust laws and the commerce clause of the united states constitution in a separate proceeding pending in the same court plaintiffs assert the same theories against not only new york officials but also the attorneys general for thirty other states the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has held that the allegations in both actions if proven establish a basis for relief on antitrust and commerce clause grounds and that the trial courts in new york have personal jurisdiction sufficient to enjoin other states’ officials from enforcing their msarelated legislation on remand in those two actions one trial court has granted summary judgment for the new york officials and lifted a 

  

preliminary injunction against new york officials’ enforcement against plaintiffs of the state’s “allocable share” amendment to the msa’s model escrow statute the other trial court has held that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits the former decision is on appeal to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 

  

in another action the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed a trial court’s dismissal of challenges to msarelated legislation in louisiana under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution on remand in that case and in another case filed against the louisiana attorney general trial courts have granted summary judgment for the louisiana attorney general both of those decisions are on appeal to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 

  

the united states courts of appeals for the sixth eighth ninth and tenth circuits have affirmed dismissals or grants of summary judgment in favor of state officials in four other cases asserting antitrust and constitutional challenges to the allocable share amendment legislation in those states on december 30 2009 the plaintiff in the eighth circuit case filed a petition for certiorari with the united states supreme court 

  

another proceeding has been initiated before an international arbitration tribunal under the provisions of the north american free trade agreement a hearing on the merits concluded on february 14 2010 

  

federal government’s lawsuit 

  

in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others including altria group inc asserting claims under three federal statutes namely the medical care recovery act “mcra” the msp provisions of the social security act and the civil provisions of rico trial of the case ended in june 2005 the lawsuit sought to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobaccorelated illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs including medicare military and veterans’ health benefits programs and the federal employees health benefits program the complaint alleged that such costs total more than 20 billion annually it also sought what it alleged to be equitable and declaratory relief including disgorgement of profits which arose from defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct in september 2000 the trial court dismissed the government’s mcra and msp claims but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief under the civil provisions of rico 

  

the government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2004 the trial court issued an order denying defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy in february 2005 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under the civil provisions of rico and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim in april 2005 the court of appeals denied the government’s motion for rehearing in july 2005 the government petitioned the united states supreme court for further review of the court of appeals’ ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy and in october 2005 the supreme court denied the petition 

  

in june 2005 the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment seeking remedies of approximately 14 billion including 10 billion over a fiveyear period to fund a national 

  

smoking cessation program and 4 billion over a tenyear period to fund a public education and countermarketing campaign further the government’s proposed remedy would have required defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 are not achieved according to a prescribed timetable the government’s proposed remedies also included a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business operations—including but not limited to restrictions on advertising and marketing potential measures with respect to certain price promotional activities and research and development disclosure requirements for certain confidential data and implementation of a monitoring system with potential broad powers over cigarette operations 

  

in august 2006 the federal trial court entered judgment in favor of the government the court held that certain defendants including altria group inc and pm usa violated rico and engaged in 7 of the 8 “subschemes” to defraud that the government had alleged specifically the court found that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the court did not impose monetary penalties on the defendants but ordered the following relief i an injunction against “committing any act of racketeering” relating to the manufacturing marketing promotion health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states ii an injunction against participating directly or indirectly in the management or control of the council for tobacco research the tobacco institute or the center for indoor air research or any successor or affiliated entities of each iii an injunction against “making or causing to be made in any way any material false misleading or deceptive statement or representation or engaging in any public relations or marketing endeavor that is disseminated to the united states public and that misrepresents or suppresses information concerning cigarettes” iv an injunction against conveying any express or implied health message through use of descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material including “lights” “ultra lights” and “low tar” which the court found could cause consumers to believe one cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand v the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking “low tar” or “light” cigarettes defendants’ manipulation of cigarette design to ensure optimum nicotine delivery and the adverse health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke vi the disclosure on defendants’ public document websites and in the minnesota document repository of all documents produced to the government in the lawsuit or produced in any future court or administrative action concerning smoking and health until 2021 with certain additional requirements as to documents withheld from production under a claim of privilege or confidentiality vii the disclosure of disaggregated marketing data to the government in the same form and on the same schedule as defendants now follow in disclosing such data to the ftc for a period of ten years viii certain restrictions on the sale or transfer by defendants of any cigarette brands brand names formulas or cigarette businesses within the united states and ix payment of the government’s costs in bringing the action 

  

in september 2006 defendants filed notices of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and in october 2006 a three judge panel of the court of appeals stayed the trial court’s judgment pending its review of the decision certain defendants including pm usa and altria group inc filed a motion to clarify the trial court’s august 2006 final judgment and remedial order in march 2007 the trial court denied in part and granted in part defendants’ posttrial motion for clarification of portions of the court’s remedial order 

  

in may 2009 a threejudge panel of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a per curiam decision largely affirming the trial court’s judgment against defendants and in favor of the government although the panel largely affirmed the remedial order that was issued by the trial court it vacated the following aspects of the order 

  

   

   

   

   

the court of appeals panel remanded the case for the trial court to reconsider these four aspects of the injunction and to reformulate its remedial order accordingly 

  

furthermore the court of appeals panel rejected all of the government’s and intervenor’s cross appeal arguments and refused to broaden the remedial order entered by the trial court the court of appeals panel also left undisturbed its prior holding that the government cannot obtain disgorgement as a permissible remedy under rico 

  

in july 2009 defendants filed petitions for a rehearing before the panel and for a rehearing by the entire court of appeals defendants also filed a motion to vacate portions of the trial court’s judgment on the grounds of mootness because of the passage of legislation granting fda broad authority over the regulation of tobacco products in september 2009 the court of appeals entered three per curiam rulings two of them denied defendants’ petitions for panel rehearing or for rehearing en banc  in the third per curiam decision the court of appeals denied defendants’ suggestion of mootness and motion for partial vacatur  in september 2009 defendants petitioned the court of appeals to issue a stay of its mandate pending the filing and disposition of petitions for writs of certiorari to the united states supreme court in october 2009 the court of appeals granted the motion in part staying the issuance of the mandate until december 28 2009 on december 11 2009 the court of appeals extended the stay of the mandate through the supreme court’s final disposition of defendants’ certiorari petitions on february 19 2010 pm usa and altria group inc filed their certiorari petitions with the united states supreme court in addition the federal government filed its own certiorari petition asking the court to reverse an earlier court of appeals decision and hold that civil rico allows the trial court to order disgorgement as well as other equitable relief such as smoking cessation remedies designed to redress continuing consequences of prior rico violations the trial court’s judgment and remedial orders remain stayed

ust litigation 

  

types of cases 

  

claims related to smokeless tobacco products generally fall within the following categories 

  

first ust andor its tobacco subsidiaries has been named in certain health care cost reimbursementthirdparty recoupmentclass action litigation against the major domestic cigarette companies and others seeking damages and other relief the complaints in these cases on their face predominantly relate to the usage of cigarettes within that context certain complaints contain a few allegations relating specifically to smokeless tobacco products these actions are in varying stages of pretrial activities

third ust andor its tobacco subsidiaries has been named in a number of other individual tobacco and health suits plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery such as negligence strict liability fraud misrepresentation design defect failure to warn breach of implied warranty addiction and breach of consumer protection statutes plaintiffs seek various forms of relief including compensatory and punitive damages and certain equitable relief including but not limited to disgorgement defenses raised in these cases include lack of causation assumption of the risk comparative fault andor contributory negligence and statutes of limitations usstc is currently named in an action in florida  vassallo  and in an action in connecticut  hill  trial in the hill case is set to commence in december 2010 

  

antitrust litigation 

  

following a previous antitrust action brought against ust and certain of its tobacco subsidiaries by a competitor conwood company lp ust and certain of its tobacco subsidiaries were named as defendants in certain actions brought by indirect purchasers consumers in a number of jurisdictions as indirect purchasers of usstc’s smokeless tobacco products during various periods of time ranging 

  

from january 1990 to the date of certification or potential certification of the proposed classes plaintiffs in those actions alleged individually and on behalf of putative class members in a particular state or individually and on behalf of class members in the applicable states that ust and certain of its tobacco subsidiaries violated the antitrust laws unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes andor common law of those states in connection with these actions plaintiffs sought to recover compensatory and statutory damages in an amount not to exceed 75000 per purported class member or per class member and certain other relief the indirect purchaser actions as filed were similar in all material respects 

  

the indirect purchaser actions have been settled in all jurisdictions pursuant to the settlements in all jurisdictions except california and massachusetts adult consumers received coupons redeemable on future purchases of usstc’s moist smokeless tobacco products and ust agreed to pay all related administrative costs and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees as of january 31 2010 ust has recognized a liability of approximately 74 million reflecting the costs attributable to coupons previously distributed to kansas new hampshire new york and wisconsin class members which are redeemable on future purchases of usstc’s moist smokeless tobacco products the california and massachusetts settlements were for cash only and did not involve distribution of coupons 

  

other litigation 

  

in september 2008 plaintiffs filed a purported class action on behalf of a purported class of ust stockholders in superior court in connecticut to enjoin the proposed acquisition of ust by altria group inc alleging among other things that ust andor nine of its directors had violated their fiduciary duties by agreeing to the terms of the acquisition and that altria group inc had aided and abetted in the alleged violation in october 2008 plaintiffs amended the complaint to add allegations concerning ust’s definitive proxy statement and certain benefits payable to ust’s officers in connection with the transaction the amended complaint also included aiding and abetting claims against ust in december 2008 the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle this lawsuit and resolve all claims the settlement received final court approval in october 2009 the settlement amount was immaterial 

  

certain other actions 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the irs concluded its examination of altria group inc’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999 and issued a final revenue agent’s report “rar” in march 2006 the rar disallowed benefits pertaining to certain pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 altria group inc agreed with all conclusions of the rar with the exception of the disallowance of benefits pertaining to several pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 altria group inc contests approximately 150 million of tax and net interest assessed and paid with regard to them the irs may in the future challenge and disallow more of pmcc’s leveraged lease benefits based on revenue rulings an irs notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases leaseinleaseout “lilo” and saleinleaseout “silo” transactions 

  

in october 2006 altria group inc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york to claim refunds on a portion of these tax payments and associated interest for the years 1996 and 1997 in july 2009 the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the irs and subsequently altria group inc filed motions for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative for a new trial 

  

in march 2008 altria group inc filed a second complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking a refund of the tax payments and associated interest for the 

  

years 1998 and 1999 attributable to the disallowance of benefits claimed in those years with respect to the leases subject to the recent jury verdict and with respect to certain other leases entered into in 1998 and 1999 

  

based on notices of proposed adjustments received by altria group inc we expect that the irs will challenge and disallow tax benefits claimed by altria group inc with respect to the leases subject to the recent jury verdict plus other pmcc leveraged lease transactions characterized by the irs as lilos and silos including benefits claimed from lilo and silo transactions entered into during both the 1996 – 1999 years and the 2000 – 2003 years altria group inc plans to contest proposed leveraged lease adjustments made by the irs the total disallowance for 2000 – 2003 for these leases in federal income tax and related interest would be approximately 10 billion 

  

if the tax benefits for the transactions entered into from 1996 to 2003 were similarly disallowed for the period january 1 2004 through december 31 2009 the disallowance for such period for these leases in federal income tax and related interest would be approximately 900 million taking into account federal income tax paid or payable on gains associated with sales of leased assets during that period 

  

the payment if any of the foregoing amounts would depend upon the timing and outcome of the ongoing 2000 – 2003 audit and future irs audits and any related administrative challenges or litigation 

  

lilo and silo transactions represent approximately 40 of the net finance assets of pmcc’s lease portfolio pmcc entered into no lilo or silo transactions after 2003 

  

should altria group inc not prevail in these matters altria group inc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax pay associated interest costs and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year 

  

kraft thrift plan case  four participants in the kraft foods global inc thrift plan “kraft thrift plan” a defined contribution plan filed a class action complaint on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries of the kraft thrift plan in july 2008 in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois alleging breach of fiduciary duty under the employee retirement income security act “erisa” named defendants in this action include altria corporate services inc now altria client services inc and certain company committees that allegedly had a relationship to the kraft thrift plan plaintiffs request among other remedies that defendants restore to the kraft thrift plan all losses improperly incurred the altria group inc defendants deny any violation of erisa or other unlawful conduct and intend to defend the case vigorously under the terms of a distribution agreement between altria group inc and kraft altria client services inc and related defendants may be entitled to indemnity against any liabilities incurred in connection with this case 

  

environmental regulation 

  

altria group inc and its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection including in the united states the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party subsidiaries and former subsidiaries of altria group inc are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under superfund or other laws and regulations altria group inc’s 

  

subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations although it is not possible to predict precise levels of environmentalrelated expenditures compliance with such laws and regulations including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of such expenditures has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations capital expenditures financial position earnings or competitive position 

  

guarantees 

  

at december 31 2009 altria group inc had a 12 million thirdparty guarantee related to a divestiture which was recorded as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet this guarantee has no specified expiration date altria group inc is required to perform under this guarantee in the event that a third party fails to make contractual payments in the ordinary course of business certain subsidiaries of altria group inc have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation at december 31 2009 subsidiaries of altria group inc were also contingently liable for 25 million of guarantees related to their own performance consisting primarily of surety bonds these items have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact on altria group inc’s liquidity 

  

under the terms of a distribution agreement between altria group inc and pmi entered into in connection with the pmi spinoff liabilities concerning tobacco products will be allocated based in substantial part on the manufacturer pmi will indemnify altria group inc and pm usa for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa and pm usa will indemnify pmi for liabilities related to tobacco products manufactured by pm usa excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi altria group inc does not have a related liability recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 as the fair value of this indemnification is insignificant 

  

as more fully discussed in note 23 condensed consolidating financial information to altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2009 annual report pm usa has issued guarantees relating to altria group inc’s obligations under its outstanding debt securities and borrowings under its revolving credit agreements and its commercial paper program 

  

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

  

in september 2007 ust completed the acquisition of stag’s leap wine cellars through one of its consolidated subsidiaries michelleantinori llc “michelleantinori” in which ust holds an 85 ownership interest with a 15 noncontrolling interest held by antinori california “antinori” in connection with the acquisition of stag’s leap wine cellars  ust entered into a put arrangement with antinori the put arrangement as later amended provides antinori with the right to require ust to purchase its 15 ownership interest in michelleantinori at a price equal to antinori’s initial investment of 27 million the put arrangement becomes exercisable beginning september 11 2010 as of december 31 2009 the redemption value of the put arrangement did not exceed the noncontrolling interest balance therefore no adjustment to the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the put arrangement 

  

the noncontrolling interest put arrangement is accounted for as mandatorily redeemable securities because redemption is outside of the control of ust as such the redeemable noncontrolling interest is reported in the mezzanine equity section in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009

c narrative description of business 

  

tobacco products 

  

pm usa is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in the united states 

  

middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machinemade large cigars and pipe tobacco 

  

pm usa is in the process of closing its cabarrus north carolina manufacturing facility and consolidating cigarette manufacturing for the us market at its richmond virginia manufacturing center pm usa decided in 2007 to consolidate its manufacturing in response to declining us cigarette volume and notice from pmi that it would no longer source cigarettes from pm usa pm usa’s cigarette production for pmi which ended in december 2008 approximated 21 billion and 57 billion cigarettes in 2008 and 2007 respectively pm usa expects to close its cabarrus manufacturing facility by the end of 2010 

  

cigarettes and other tobacco products 

  

pm usa is the largest tobacco company in the united states with total cigarette shipments in the united states of 1694 billion units in 2008 a decrease of 32 from 2007 

  

pm usa’s major premium brands are marlboro virginia slims and parliament  its principal discount brand is basic  all of its brands are marketed to take into account differing preferences of adult smokers marlboro is the largestselling cigarette brand in the united states with shipments of 1415 billion units in 2008 down 20 from 2007 

  

in the premium segment pm usa’s 2008 shipment volume decreased 30 from 2007 and its shipment volume in the discount segment decreased 65 shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 926 of pm usa’s total 2008 volume up from 923 in 2007

as the cigarette industry environment continues to evolve pm usa believes that it cannot accurately predict estimated future cigarette industry decline rates and for this reason pm usa does not provide this guidance evolving industry dynamics include the uncertain economic conditions unpredictable federal and state cigarette excise tax increases adult consumer activity across multiple tobacco categories and trade inventory changes as wholesalers and retailers continue to adjust their levels of cigarette inventories pm usa believes that its results may be materially adversely affected by the items discussed in item 1a risk factors  

  

cigars

middleton entered into an agreement with pm usa to leverage pm usa’s distribution network and field sales force to represent middleton’s brands in midmarch 2008 pm usa’s sales force began representing middleton’s brands at retail and supporting the execution of middleton’s trade marketing programs 

  

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services 

  

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality taste price product innovation marketing packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts including coupons product promotions and allowances for new products the tobacco products of altria group inc’s subsidiaries are advertised and promoted through various media although television and radio advertising of certain tobacco products is prohibited in the united states in addition as discussed below in item 3 legal proceedings  pm usa ust and other us tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

  

in the united states under a contract growing program known as the tobacco farmer partnering program pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers under the terms of this program pm usa agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts pm usa also purchases its united states tobacco requirements through other sources in 2003 in connection with the settlement of a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quotaholders against certain manufacturers including pm usa and leaf dealers pm usa and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit the agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant including pm usa to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from us tobacco growers over a period of at least ten years these quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement 

  

tobacco production in the united states was historically subject to government controls including the production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provided for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quotaholders the cost of the buyout which is estimated at approximately 95 billion is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the quota buyout payments offset already scheduled payments to the national tobacco grower settlement trust the “ntgst” see item 3 legal proceedings  health care cost recovery litigation—national grower settlement trust for a discussion of the ntgst manufacturers and importers of tobacco products including the tobacco subsidiaries of altria group inc are also obligated to cover any losses up to 500 million 

  

that the government incurred on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program pm usa has paid 138 million for its share of the tobacco pool stock losses the quota buyout did not have a material impact on altria group inc’s 2008 consolidated results and altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2009 and beyond 

  

middleton purchases burley and flue cured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf dealers located in the united states middleton does not participate in the pm usa tobacco farmers partnering program 

  

altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report 

  

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor 

  

   

webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2008 annual report you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time 

  

tobaccorelated litigation  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and ust as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contraband shipments patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of competitors and distributors 

  

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome 

  

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 43 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all 

  

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty management believes the litigation environment has substantially improved altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so please see note 20 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements item 3 legal proceedings  and exhibit 991 for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

tobacco control action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking restricting marketing and advertising imposing regulations on packaging warnings and disclosure of ingredients and flavors prohibiting the sale of tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors or other characteristics the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes and seeking to hold them responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels 

  

excise taxes  tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes and significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states at the state federal and local levels tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our tobacco products due to lower consumption levels and to a shift in consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products for further discussion see tobacco business environment—excise taxes in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2008 annual report 

  

increased competition in the united states tobacco categories  each of altria group inc’s tobacco subsidiaries operates in highly competitive tobacco categories settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands usstc faces significant competition in the moist smokeless tobacco category both from existing competitors and new entrants and has experienced consumer down trading to lowerpriced brands 

  

governmental investigations  from time to time altria group inc and its tobacco subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our tobacco subsidiaries’ businesses could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of future investigations 

  

new tobacco product technologies  altria group inc’s subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new tobacco product technologies that may reduce the health risks associated with the tobacco products they manufacture while continuing to offer adult consumers tobacco products that meet their taste expectations potential solutions being researched include tobacco products that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke andor those constituents identified by public health authorities as harmful our subsidiaries may not succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors does our subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers or whether consumers’ purchase decisions would be affected by such claims which could affect the commercial viability of any tobacco products that might be developed 

  

adjacency strategy  altria group inc and its subsidiaries have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful 

  

tobacco price availability and quality  any significant change in tobacco leaf prices quality or availability could affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business for a discussion of factors that influence leaf prices availability and quality see tobacco business environment—tobacco price availability and quality in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the 2008 annual report 

  

attracting and retaining talent  our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result our tobacco subsidiaries may be unable to attract and retain the best talent 

  

competition and economic downturns  each of our consumer product subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and changes in economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the willingness of consumers to purchase premium consumer product brands depends in part on economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may purchase more private label and other discount brands andor in the case of tobacco products consider lower price tobacco products the volumes of our consumer products subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if parties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our earnings 

  

acquisitions  altria group inc from time to time considers acquisitions as part of its adjacency strategy from time to time we may engage in confidential acquisition negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement although we seek to maintain or improve our debt ratings over time it is possible that completing a given acquisition or other event could impact our debt ratings or the outlook for those ratings furthermore acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or that acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  

ust acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will achieve the synergies expected of the ust acquisition or that the integration of ust will be successful 

  

capital markets  access to the capital markets is important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs disruption and uncertainty in the capital markets and any resulting tightening of credit availability pricing andor credit terms may increase our costs and adversely affect our earnings or our dividend rate 

  

asset impairment  we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by the market conditions noted above as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the internal revenue service has challenged the tax treatment of certain of pmcc’s leveraged leases should altria group inc not prevail in this litigation altria group inc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year for further discussion see note 20 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements and item 3 legal proceedings 

  

wine—competition grape supply regulation and excise taxes  as previously noted ste michelle’s business is subject to significant competition including from many large wellestablished national and international organizations the adequacy of ste michelle’s grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industrywide production levels as well as by weather and crop conditions particularly in eastern washington state supply shortages related to any one or more of these factors could increase production costs and wine prices which ultimately may have a negative impact on ste michelle’s sales in addition federal state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means including licensing requirements pricing labeling and advertising restrictions and distribution and production policies new regulations or revisions to existing regulations resulting in further restrictions or taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on ste michelle’s wine business

the property in richmond virginia that serves as the headquarters facility for altria group inc pm usa and certain other subsidiaries is under lease 

  

at december 31 2008 pm usa owned and operated five tobacco manufacturing and processing facilities—four in the richmond virginia area and one in cabarrus county north carolina in addition pm usa owns a research and technology center in richmond virginia pm usa is in the process of closing its cabarrus north carolina manufacturing facility and consolidating cigarette manufacturing for the us market at its richmond virginia manufacturing center in 2007 pm usa decided to consolidate its manufacturing in response to declining us cigarette volume and notice from pmi that it would no longer source cigarettes from pm usa pm usa’s cigarette production for pmi which ended in december 2008 approximated 21 billion and 57 billion cigarettes in 2008 and 2007 respectively pm usa expects to close its cabarrus manufacturing facility by the end of 2010

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group inc and its subsidiaries including pm usa and usstc as well as their respective indemnitees various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including product liability consumer protection antitrust tax contraband shipments patent infringement employment matters claims for contribution and claims of distributors 

  

litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated or other litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation damages claimed in some tobaccorelated or other litigation are or can be significant and in certain cases range in the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome 

  

although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 43 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all 

  

altria group inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings  i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

  

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of altria group inc or one or more of its subsidiaries could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty management believes the litigation environment has substantially improved in recent years altria group inc and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however altria group inc and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of altria group inc to do so

in may 2001 the trial court approved a stipulation providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the engle judgment will remain stayed against pm usa and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review as a result of the stipulation pm usa placed 500 million into a separate interestbearing escrow account that regardless of the outcome of the judicial review will be paid to the court and the court will determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with florida rules of civil procedure in july 2001 pm usa also placed 12 billion into an interestbearing escrow account which was returned to pm usa in december 2007 in addition the 100 million bond related to the case has been discharged in connection with the stipulation pm usa recorded a 500 million pretax charge in its consolidated statement of earnings for the quarter ended march 31 2001 in may 2003 the florida third district court of appeal reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class plaintiffs petitioned the florida supreme court for further review 

  

in july 2006 the florida supreme court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated that the class approved by the trial court be decertified and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate the court further declared the following phase i findings are entitled to res judicata effect in such individual actions brought within one year of the issuance of the mandate i that smoking causes various diseases ii that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive iii that defendants’ cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous iv that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking v that defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their detriment vi that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment vii that all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective and viii that defendants were negligent the court also reinstated compensatory damage awards totaling approximately 69 million to two individual plaintiffs and found that a third plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations in february 2008 pm usa paid a total of 2964685 which represents its share of compensatory damages and interest to the two individual plaintiffs identified in the florida supreme court’s order 

  

in august 2006 pm usa sought rehearing from the florida supreme court on parts of its july 2006 opinion including the ruling described above that certain jury findings have res judicata effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by engle class members the rehearing motion also asked among other things that legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the third district court of appeal or in the florida supreme court now be addressed plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in august 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability of the statute of limitations to nonmembers of the decertified class in december 2006 the florida supreme court refused to revise its july 2006 ruling except that it revised the set of phase i findings entitled to res judicata effect by excluding finding v listed above relating to agreement to misrepresent information and added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that at the time of sale or supply did not conform to the representations of fact made by defendants in january 2007 the florida supreme court issued the mandate from its revised opinion defendants then filed a motion with the florida third district court of appeal requesting that the court address legal errors that were previously raised by defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the third district court of appeal or by the florida supreme court in february 2007 the third district court of appeal denied defendants’ motion in may 2007 defendants’ motion for a partial stay of the mandate pending the completion of appellate review was denied by the third district court of appeal in may 2007 defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court in october 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition in november 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition for rehearing from the denial of their petition for writ of certiorari

denied this motion in november 2007 in february 2008 the trial court decertified the class except for purposes of the may 2001 bond stipulation and formally vacated the punitive damage award pursuant to the florida supreme court’s mandate in april 2008 the trial court ruled that certain defendants including pm usa lacked standing with respect to allocation of the funds escrowed under the may 2001 bond stipulation and will receive no credit at this time from the 500 million paid by pm usa against any future punitive damages awards in cases brought by former engle class members

three federal district courts in the merlob brown and burr cases have ruled that the findings in the first phase of the engle proceedings cannot be used to satisfy elements of plaintiffs’ claims and two of those rulings brown and burr have been certified by the trial court for interlocutory review the certification in both cases has been granted by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit and the appeals have been consolidated on february 10 2009 the appeal in burr was dismissed for lack of prosecution engle progeny cases pending in the federal district courts in the middle district of florida asserting individual claims by or on behalf of approximately 4000 plaintiffs have been stayed pending interlocutory review by the eleventh circuit several state trial court judges have issued contrary rulings that allowed plaintiffs to use the engle findings to establish elements of their claims and required certain defenses to be stricken

in july 2003 following the first phase of the trial in the scott class action in which plaintiffs sought creation of a fund to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs a louisiana jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants including pm usa in connection with plaintiffs’ medical monitoring claims but also found that plaintiffs could benefit from smoking cessation assistance the jury also found that cigarettes as designed are not defective but that the defendants failed to disclose all they knew about smoking and diseases and marketed their products to minors in may 2004 in the second phase of the trial the jury awarded plaintiffs approximately 590 million against all defendants jointly and severally to fund a 10year smoking cessation program 

  

in june 2004 the court entered judgment which awarded plaintiffs the approximately 590 million jury award plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date the suit commenced pm usa’s share of the jury award and prejudgment interest has not been allocated defendants including pm usa appealed pursuant to a stipulation of the parties the trial court entered an order setting the amount of the bond at 50 million for all defendants in accordance with an article of the louisiana code of civil procedure and a louisiana statute the “bond cap law” fixing the amount of security in civil cases involving a signatory to the msa as defined below under the terms of the stipulation plaintiffs reserve the right to contest at a later date the sufficiency or amount of the bond on any grounds including the applicability or constitutionality of the bond cap law in september 2004 defendants collectively posted a bond in the amount of 50 million

in september 2008 defendants filed an application for writ of mandamus or supervisory writ to secure the right to appeal with the louisiana circuit court of appeals the appellate court on november 17 2008 granted the defendants’ w rit and directed the trial court to enter an order permitting the appeal and to set the appeal bond in accordance with louisiana law plaintiffs’ supervisory writ petition to the louisiana supreme court was denied on december 10 2008 on december 15 2008 the trial court entered an order permitting the appeal and approving a 50 million bond for all defendants in accordance with the louisiana “bond cap law” discussed above

class certification has been denied or reversed by courts in 57 smoking and health class actions involving pm usa in arkansas 1 the district of columbia 2 florida 2 illinois 2 iowa 1 kansas 1 louisiana 1 maryland 1 michigan 1 minnesota 1 nevada 29 new jersey 6 new york 2 ohio 1 oklahoma 1 pennsylvania 1 puerto rico 1 south carolina 1 texas 1 and wisconsin 1 a class remains certified in the scott class action discussed above

health care cost recovery litigation 

  

overview 

  

in health care cost recovery litigation governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  

the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  

defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  

although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and six state appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  

in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the original participating manufacturers make substantial annual payments of 94 billion each year excluding future annual payments if any under the national tobacco grower settlement trust discussed below subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume in addition the original participating manufacturers are required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million 

  

the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  

possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 

  

pursuant to the provisions of the msa domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa who are original signatories to the msa the “original participating manufacturers” or “opms” are participating in proceedings that may result in downward adjustments to the amounts paid by the opms and the other msaparticipating manufacturers to the states and territories that are parties to the msa for the years 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 the proceedings are based on the collective loss of market share for 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively by all participating manufacturers who are subject to the payment obligations and marketing restrictions of the msa to nonparticipating manufacturers “npms” who are not subject to such obligations and restrictions 

  

in these proceedings an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the msa parties or otherwise selected pursuant to the msa’s provisions is required to determine whether the 

  

disadvantages of the msa were a “significant factor” contributing to the collective loss of market share for the year in question if the firm determines that the disadvantages of the msa were such a “significant factor” each state may avoid a downward adjustment to its share of the participating manufacturers’ annual payments for that year by establishing that it diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during the entirety of that year any potential downward adjustment would then be reallocated to those states that do not establish such diligent enforcement pm usa believes that the msa’s arbitration clause requires a state to submit its claim to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute to binding arbitration before a panel of three former federal judges in the manner provided for in the msa a number of states have taken the position that this claim should be decided in state court on a statebystate basis 

  

in march 2006 an independent economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2003 in february 2007 this same firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2004 in february 2008 the same economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2005 a different economic consulting firm has been selected to make the “significant factor” determination regarding the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2006 the new firm’s decision with respect to 2006 is expected in march 2009 

  

following the economic consulting firm’s determination with respect to 2003 thirtyeight states filed declaratory judgment actions in state courts seeking a declaration that the state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers have responded to these actions by filing motions to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the msa including filing motions to compel arbitration in eleven msa states and territories that have not filed declaratory judgment actions courts in all 46 msa states and the district of columbia and puerto rico have ruled that the question of whether a state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 is subject to arbitration several of these rulings remain subject to appeal or further review additionally ohio filed a declaratory judgment action in state court with respect to the 2004 diligent enforcement issue the action has been stayed pending the decision about the 2003 payments pm usa the other opms and approximately 25 other msaparticipating manufacturers have entered into an agreement regarding arbitration with over 40 msa states concerning the 2003 npm adjustment the agreement provides for selection of the arbitration panel for the 2003 npm adjustment beginning by october 1 2009 and for the arbitration then to proceed the agreement further provides for a partial liability reduction for the 2003 npm adjustment of a specified percentage for states that entered into the agreement by january 30 2009 and are determined in the arbitration not to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during 2003 based on the number of states that entered into the agreement by january 30 2009 fortyfive 45 the percentage reduction for those states is 20 the partial liability reduction would reduce the amount of pm usa’s 2003 npm adjustment by up to a corresponding percentage 

  

the availability and the precise amount of any npm adjustment for 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 will not be finally determined until 2010 or thereafter there is no certainty that the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers will ultimately receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings if the opms do receive such an adjustment through these proceedings the adjustment would be allocated among the opms pursuant to the msa’s provisions and pm usa’s share would likely be applied as a credit against one or several future msa payments 

  

national grower settlement trust 

  

as part of the msa the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobaccogrowing states to address concerns about the potential adverse economic impact of the msa on 

  

tobacco growers and quota holders to that end in 1999 four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa established the national tobacco grower settlement trust “ntgst” a trust fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quota holders the trust was to be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments prior to application of various adjustments scheduled to total 515 billion provisions of the ntgst allowed for offsets to the extent that industryfunded payments were made for the benefit of growers or quota holders as part of a legislated end to the federal tobacco quota and price support program 

  

in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout which is estimated at approximately 95 billion is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the quota buyout payments offset already scheduled payments to the ntgst however two of the grower states maryland and pennsylvania have filed claims in the north carolina state courts asserting that the companies which established the ntgst including pm usa must continue making payments under the ntgst through 2010 for the benefit of maryland and pennsylvania growers such continuing payments would represent slightly more than one percent of the originally scheduled payments that would have been due to the ntgst for the years 2005 through 2010 notwithstanding the offsets resulting from the fetra payments the north carolina trial court held in favor of maryland and pennsylvania and the companies including pm usa appealed the north carolina court of appeals in december 2008 reversed the trial court ruling on january 20 2009 maryland and pennsylvania filed a notice of appeal to the north carolina supreme court in addition to the approximately 95 billion cost of the buyout fetra also obligated manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government incurred on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program pm usa has paid 138 million for its share of the tobacco pool stock losses the quota buyout did not have a material impact on altria group inc’s 2008 consolidated results and altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2009 and beyond 

  

other msarelated litigation 

  

pm usa was named as a defendant in an action brought in october 2008 in federal court in kentucky by an msa participating manufacturer that is not an opm other defendants include various other participating manufacturers and the attorneys general of all 52 states and territories that are parties to the msa the plaintiff alleged that certain of the msa’s payment provisions discriminate against it in favor of certain other participating manufacturers in violation of the federal antitrust laws and the united states constitution the plaintiff also sought injunctive relief alteration of certain msa payment provisions as applied to it treble damages under the federal antitrust laws andor rescission of its joinder in the msa the plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the states from enforcing the allegedly discriminatory payment provisions against it during the pendency of action on november 14 2008 defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on various grounds and on january 5 2009 the court dismissed the complaint and denied plaintiff’s request for preliminary injunctive relief 

  

in december 2008 pm usa was named as a defendant in an action seeking declaratory relief under the msa the action was filed in california state court by the same msa participating manufacturer that filed the kentucky action discussed in the preceding paragraph other defendants include the state of california and various other participating manufacturers the plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that its proposed amended adherence agreement with california and other states that are parties to the msa is consistent with provisions in the msa and that the msa’s limited most 

  

favored nations provision does not apply to the proposed agreement plaintiff seeks no damages in this action defendants have not yet responded to the complaint 

  

without naming pm usa or any other private party as a defendant manufacturers that have elected not to sign the msa “npms” andor their distributors or customers have filed several legal challenges to the msa and related legislation new york state officials are defendants in a lawsuit pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in which cigarette importers allege that the msa andor related legislation violates federal antitrust laws and the commerce clause of the united states constitution in a separate proceeding pending in the same court plaintiffs assert the same theories against not only new york officials but also the attorneys general for thirty other states the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has held that the allegations in both actions if proven establish a basis for relief on antitrust and commerce clause grounds and that the trial courts in new york have personal jurisdiction sufficient to enjoin other states’ officials from enforcing their msarelated legislation on remand in those two actions one trial court has granted summary judgment for the new york officials and the other has held that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits in addition a preliminary injunction against new york officials’ enforcement against plaintiffs of the state’s “allocable share” amendment to the msa’s model escrow statute has been lifted 

  

in another action the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed a trial court’s dismissal of challenges to msarelated legislation in louisiana under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution the case and another challenge to louisiana’s participation in the msa and louisiana’s msarelated legislation began summary judgment proceedings during the fourth quarter of 2008 another proceeding has been initiated before an international arbitration tribunal under the provisions of the north american free trade agreement a twoday hearing on the merits is scheduled for june 2009 an appeal from trial court decisions holding that plaintiffs have failed to make allegations establishing a claim for relief is pending with the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit the united states courts of appeals for the sixth and ninth circuits have affirmed the dismissals in two similar challenges in july 2008 the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed dismissals and summary judgment orders in two cases emanating from kansas and oklahoma and in doing so rejected antitrust and constitutional challenges to the allocable share amendment legislation in those states 

  

federal government’s lawsuit 

  

in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others including altria group inc asserting claims under three federal statutes namely the medical care recovery act “mcra” the msp provisions of the social security act and the civil provisions of rico trial of the case ended in june 2005 the lawsuit sought to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobaccorelated illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs including medicare military and veterans’ health benefits programs and the federal employees health benefits program the complaint alleged that such costs total more than 20 billion annually it also sought what it alleged to be equitable and declaratory relief including disgorgement of profits which arose from defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct in september 2000 the trial court dismissed the government’s mcra and msp claims but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief under the civil provisions of rico 

  

the government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2004 the trial court issued an order denying defendants’ motion for partial 

  

summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy in february 2005 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under the civil provisions of rico and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim in april 2005 the court of appeals denied the government’s motion for rehearing in july 2005 the government petitioned the united states supreme court for further review of the court of appeals’ ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy and in october 2005 the supreme court denied the petition 

  

in june 2005 the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment seeking remedies of approximately 14 billion including 10 billion over a fiveyear period to fund a national smoking cessation program and 4 billion over a tenyear period to fund a public education and countermarketing campaign further the government’s proposed remedy would have required defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 are not achieved according to a prescribed timetable the government’s proposed remedies also included a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business operations—including but not limited to restrictions on advertising and marketing potential measures with respect to certain price promotional activities and research and development disclosure requirements for certain confidential data and implementation of a monitoring system with potential broad powers over cigarette operations 

  

in august 2006 the federal trial court entered judgment in favor of the government the court held that certain defendants including altria group inc and pm usa violated rico and engaged in 7 of the 8 “subschemes” to defraud that the government had alleged specifically the court found that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the court did not impose monetary penalties on the defendants but ordered the following relief i an injunction against “committing any act of racketeering” relating to the manufacturing marketing promotion health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states ii an injunction against participating directly or indirectly in the management or control of the council for tobacco research the tobacco institute or the center for indoor air research or any successor or affiliated entities of each iii an injunction against “making or causing to be made in any way any material false misleading or deceptive statement or representation or engaging in any public relations or marketing endeavor that is disseminated to the united states public and that misrepresents or suppresses information concerning cigarettes” iv an injunction against conveying any express or implied health message through use of descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material including “lights” “ultra lights” and “low tar” which the court found could cause consumers to believe one cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand v the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking “low tar” or “light” cigarettes defendants’ manipulation of cigarette design to ensure optimum nicotine delivery and the 

  

adverse health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke vi the disclosure on defendants’ public document websites and in the minnesota document repository of all documents produced to the government in the lawsuit or produced in any future court or administrative action concerning smoking and health until 2021 with certain additional requirements as to documents withheld from production under a claim of privilege or confidentiality vii the disclosure of disaggregated marketing data to the government in the same form and on the same schedule as defendants now follow in disclosing such data to the federal trade commission for a period of ten years viii certain restrictions on the sale or transfer by defendants of any cigarette brands brand names formulas or cigarette businesses within the united states and ix payment of the government’s costs in bringing the action 

  

in september 2006 defendants filed notices of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in september 2006 the trial court denied defendants’ motion to stay the judgment pending defendants’ appeals and defendants then filed an emergency motion with the court of appeals to stay enforcement of the judgment pending their appeals in october 2006 the government filed a notice of appeal in which it appealed the denial of certain remedies including the disgorgement of profits and the cessation remedies it had sought in october 2006 a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals granted defendants’ motion and stayed the trial court’s judgment pending its review of the decision certain defendants including pm usa and altria group inc filed a motion to clarify the trial court’s august 2006 final judgment and remedial order in march 2007 the trial court denied in part and granted in part defendants’ posttrial motion for clarification of portions of the court’s remedial order as noted above the trial court’s judgment and remedial order remain stayed pending the appeal to the court of appeals oral argument before the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit was heard in october 2008

antitrust litigation 

  

following a previous antitrust action brought against ust by a competitor conwood company lp ust was named as a defendant in certain actions brought by indirect purchasers consumers and retailers in a number of jurisdictions as indirect purchasers of ust’s smokeless tobacco products during various periods of time ranging from january 1990 to the date of certification or potential certification of the proposed class plaintiffs in those actions allege individually and on behalf of putative class members in a particular state or individually and on behalf of class members in the applicable states that ust has violated the antitrust laws unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes andor common law of those states in connection with these actions plaintiffs sought to recover compensatory and statutory damages in an amount not to exceed 75000 per purported class member or per class member and certain other relief the indirect purchaser actions as filed were similar in all material respects 

  

to date indirect purchaser actions in almost all of the jurisdictions have been resolved including those subject to court approval pursuant to the settlements in all jurisdictions except california adult consumers received coupons redeemable on future purchases of ust’s moist smokeless tobacco products and ust agreed to pay all related administrative costs and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees 

  

in september 2007 ust entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the california class action in march 2008 the court entered an order granting final approval of the california settlement entering judgment and dismissing the settling defendants with prejudice the court also granted 

  

plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees and costs a notice of appeal from the judgment and order granting final approval of the settlement and order granting plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees was filed by an individual class member in april 2008 

  

in january 2008 ust entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the new hampshire action in july 2008 the court entered a final judgment granting final approval of the settlement including attorneys’ fees and costs and dismissing the action with prejudice a notice of appeal was filed by an individual class member in august 2008 also in january 2008 ust entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the massachusetts class action in april 2008 the court denied preliminary approval of the massachusetts settlement but invited the parties to submit an amended settlement agreement to the court for preliminary approval in connection with the settlements of the new hampshire action and massachusetts class action during the fourth quarter of 2007 ust recognized a liability reflecting the costs attributable to coupons expected to be distributed to consumers which will be redeemable on future purchases of ust’s moist smokeless tobacco products as well as plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and other administrative costs of the settlements 

  

in addition an unresolved action remains in the state of pennsylvania which is pending in a federal court in pennsylvania in this action ust filed an appeal of the trial court’s denial of ust’s motion to dismiss the complaint in august 2008 the third circuit court of appeals ruled in ust’s favor issuing an opinion vacating the trial court’s denial and remanding the case to the trial court to determine whether plaintiffs should be granted permission to amend their complaint for the plaintiffs in the foregoing action to prevail they will now have to be granted permission to amend the complaint and then amend such complaint in a manner that satisfies the standards set forth in the august 2008 third circuit opinion the plaintiffs will also have to obtain class certification and favorable determinations on issues relating to liability causation and damages 

  

the liability associated with ust’s estimated costs to resolve all indirect purchaser actions decreased to 234 million at september 30 2008 from 754 million at december 31 2007 primarily as a result of a payment made in connection with the california settlement actual coupon redemption and payments of administrative costs related to previous settlements partially offset by charges recognized in the first nine months of 2008 reflecting a change in the estimated costs associated with the resolution of certain indirect purchaser antitrust actions 

  

ust was served with a purported class action complaint filed in federal court in west virginia attempting to challenge certain aspects of a prior settlement approved by the tennessee state court and seeking additional amounts purportedly consistent with subsequent settlements of similar actions as well as punitive damages and attorneys’ fees in may 2008 the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss thereby dismissing this action with prejudice in june 2008 plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in september 2008 plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their appeal as to ust was granted by the court thereby dismissing this action as to ust 

  

other litigation 

  

in september 2008 plaintiffs filed a purported class action on behalf of a purported class of ust stockholders in superior court in connecticut to enjoin the proposed acquisition of ust by altria group inc alleging among other things that ust andor nine of its directors had violated their fiduciary duties by agreeing to the terms of the acquisition and that altria group inc had aided and abetted in the alleged violation in october 2008 plaintiffs amended the complaint to add allegations concerning ust’s definitive proxy statement and certain benefits payable to ust’s officers in connection with the transaction the amended complaint also included aiding and abetting claims against ust on december 17 2008 the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle this lawsuit and resolve all claims the settlement amount was immaterial the process for obtaining court approval is ongoing

holders of altria group inc stock options will be treated similarly to public stockholders and will accordingly have their stock awards split into two instruments holders of altria group inc stock options will receive the following stock options which immediately after the spinoff will have an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the prespin altria group inc options 

  

   

   

holders of altria group inc restricted stock or deferred stock awarded prior to january 30 2008 will retain their existing awards and will receive the same number of shares of restricted or deferred stock of pmi the restricted stock and deferred stock will not vest until the completion of the original restriction period typically three years from the date of the original grant recipients of altria group inc deferred stock awarded on january 30 2008 who will be employed by altria group inc after the pmi distribution date will receive additional shares of deferred stock of altria group inc to preserve the intrinsic value of the award recipients of altria group inc deferred stock awarded on january 30 2008 who will be employed by pmi after the pmi distribution date will receive substitute shares of deferred stock of pmi to preserve the intrinsic value of the award 

  

to the extent that employees of the remaining altria group inc receive pmi stock options altria group inc will reimburse pmi in cash for the blackscholes fair value of the stock options to be received to the extent that pmi employees hold altria group inc stock options pmi will reimburse altria group inc in cash for the blackscholes fair value of the stock options to the extent that employees of the remaining altria group inc receive pmi deferred stock altria group inc will pay to pmi the fair value of the pmi deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures to the extent that pmi employees hold altria group inc restricted stock or deferred stock pmi will reimburse altria group inc in cash for the fair value of the restricted or deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures and any amounts previously charged to pmi for the restricted or deferred stock based upon the number of altria group inc stock awards outstanding at december 31 2007 the net amount of these reimbursements is estimated to be approximately 427 million from altria group inc to pmi however this estimate is subject to change as stock awards vest in the case of restricted and deferred stock or are exercised in the case of stock options prior to the pmi record date 

  

pmi is currently included in the altria group inc consolidated federal income tax return and pmi’s federal income tax contingencies are recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet of alg the parent company prior to the distribution of pmi shares alg will reimburse pmi in cash for these liabilities which are approximately 97 million 

  

a subsidiary of alg currently provides pmi with certain corporate services at cost plus a management fee after the pmi distribution date pmi will independently undertake these activities and services provided to pmi will cease in 2008 all intercompany accounts will be settled in cash 

  

certain employees of pmi participate in the us benefit plans offered by altria group inc after the pmi distribution date the benefits previously provided by altria group inc will be provided by pmi as a result new plans will be established by pmi and the related plan assets to the extent that the benefit plans were previously funded and liabilities will be transferred to the new plans the transfer of these benefits will result in pmi recording an additional liability of approximately 98 million in its consolidated balance sheet partially offset by the related deferred tax assets 37 million and the corresponding statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” adjustment to stockholders’ equity 23 million altria group inc will pay pmi a corresponding amount of 38 million in cash which is net of the related tax benefit 

  

altria group inc currently estimates that if the distribution had occurred on december 31 2007 it would have resulted in a net decrease to altria group inc’s stockholders’ equity of approximately 15 billion 

  

during march 2008 altria group inc will mail an information statement to all stockholders of altria group inc common stock as of the pmi record date the information statement will include information about pmi as well as information regarding procedures by which the distribution will be effected and other details of the transaction 

  

dividends and share repurchases 

  

in conjunction with its announcement of the pmi spinoff the board of directors reaffirmed its intention to adjust altria group inc’s dividend immediately following the spinoff so that altria group inc stockholders who retain their pmi shares will receive in the aggregate the same annual cash dividend rate of 300 per common share that existed before the spinoff altria group inc is expected to pay a dividend at the initial rate of 029 per common share per quarter or 116 per common share on an annualized basis altria group inc has established a dividend policy that anticipates a payout ratio of approximately 75 postspin pmi is expected to pay a dividend at the initial rate of 046 per common share per quarter or 184 per common share on an annualized basis pmi has established a dividend policy that anticipates a payout ratio of approximately 65 postspin payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of the boards of directors of the respective companies

tender offer for altria group inc notes 

  

in connection with altria group inc’s contemplated spinoff of pmi on january 31 2008 altria group inc and its subsidiary altria finance cayman islands ltd commenced tender offers to purchase for cash 26 billion of notes and debentures denominated in us dollars and approximately € 10 billion in eurodenominated bonds 

  

while altria group inc believes that the proposed spinoff of pmi is not prohibited by the indentures it believes that it is desirable to eliminate any uncertainty by amending the indentures with the consent of note holders 

  

in order to finance the tender offer altria group inc arranged a 40 billion 364day bridge loan agreement with substantially the same terms as its existing credit facilities subsequent to the spinoff of pmi altria group inc intends to issue new public debt to refinance debt incurred under the bridge loan agreement the tender offer and consent solicitation is expected to result in first quarter 2008 charges of approximately 400 million 

  

kraft spinoff 

  

on march 30 2007 the “kraft distribution date” altria group inc distributed all of its remaining interest in kraft foods inc “kraft” on a prorata basis to altria group inc stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 16 2007 the “kraft record date” in a taxfree distribution the distribution ratio was 0692024 of a share of kraft for each share of altria group inc common stock outstanding altria group inc stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares of kraft following the distribution altria group inc does not own any shares of kraft during the second quarter of 2007 altria group inc adjusted its quarterly dividend to 069 per share so that its stockholders who retained their altria group inc and kraft shares would receive in the aggregate the same dividend dollars as before the distribution in august 2007 altria group inc increased its quarterly dividend to 075 per share 

  

holders of altria group inc stock options were treated similarly to public stockholders and accordingly had their stock awards split into two instruments holders of altria group inc stock options received the following stock options which immediately after the spinoff had an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the prespin altria group inc options 

  

   

   

the new kraft option has an exercise price equal to the kraft market price at the time of the distribution 3166 multiplied by the option conversion ratio which represents the exercise price of the original altria group inc option divided by the altria group inc market price immediately before the distribution 8781 the reduced exercise price of the adjusted altria group inc option was determined by multiplying the altria group inc market price immediately following the distribution 6590 by the option conversion ratio 

  

holders of altria group inc restricted stock or deferred stock awarded prior to january 31 2007 retained their existing award and received restricted stock or deferred stock of kraft class a common stock the amount of kraft restricted stock or deferred stock awarded to such holders was calculated using the same formula set forth above with respect to new kraft options all of the restricted stock and deferred stock will vest at the completion of the original restriction period typically three years from the date of the original grant recipients of altria group inc deferred stock awarded on january 31 2007 did not receive restricted stock or deferred stock of kraft rather they received additional deferred shares of altria group inc to preserve the intrinsic value of the original award 

  

to the extent that employees of the remaining altria group inc received kraft stock options altria group inc reimbursed kraft in cash for the blackscholes fair value of the stock options received to the extent that kraft employees held altria group inc stock options kraft reimbursed altria group inc in cash for the blackscholes fair value of the stock options to the extent that holders of altria group inc deferred stock received kraft deferred stock altria group inc paid to kraft the fair value of the kraft deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures based upon the number of altria group inc stock awards outstanding at the kraft distribution date the net amount of these reimbursements resulted in a payment of 179 million from kraft to altria group inc in april 2007 the reimbursement from kraft is reflected as an increase to the additional paidin capital of altria group inc on the december 31 2007 consolidated balance sheet 

  

kraft was previously included in the altria group inc consolidated federal income tax return and federal income tax contingencies were recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet of alg as part of the intercompany account settlement discussed below alg reimbursed kraft in cash for these liabilities which as of march 30 2007 were approximately 305 million plus pretax interest of 63 million 41 million after taxes alg also reimbursed kraft in cash for the federal income tax consequences of the adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” approximately 70 million plus pretax interest of 14 million 9 million after taxes see note 14 income taxes to altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements “note 14” which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2007 annual report for a discussion of the fin 48 adoption and the tax sharing agreement between altria group inc and kraft 

  

a subsidiary of alg previously provided kraft with certain services at cost plus a 5 management fee after the kraft distribution date kraft undertook these activities and any remaining limited services provided to kraft ceased during 2007 all intercompany accounts were settled in cash within 30 days of the kraft distribution date the settlement of the intercompany accounts including the amounts discussed above related to stock awards and tax contingencies resulted in a net payment from kraft to alg of 85 million in april 2007 

  

the distribution resulted in a net decrease to altria group inc’s stockholders’ equity of 274 billion on the kraft distribution date

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report 

  

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection 

  

   

with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time 

  

tobaccorelated litigation  there is substantial litigation related to tobacco products in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases range into the billions of dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 42 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all 

  

it is possible that the consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position of pm usa pmi or altria group inc could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty management believes the litigation environment has substantially improved alg and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has a number of valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however alg and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of alg’s stockholders to do so please see note 19 of our consolidated financial statements item 3 legal proceedings and exhibit 991 for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

corporate restructuring  on january 30 2008 the board of directors of alg authorized the spinoff of pmi to alg shareholders the distribution will be made on march 28 2008 to alg shareholders of record as of 500 pm eastern time on march 19 2008 it is possible that an action may be brought seeking to enjoin the spinoff any such injunction would have to be based on a finding that altria is insolvent or would be insolvent after giving effect to the spinoff or intends to delay hinder or defraud creditors in the event the spinoff is challenged alg will defend such action vigorously including by prosecuting any necessary appeals although litigation is subject to uncertainty management believes that altria should ultimately prevail against such action 

  

tobacco control action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking restricting marketing and advertising imposing regulations on warnings and disclosure of ingredients and flavors and seeking to hold us responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of pmi’s markets driven principally by the world health organization’s framework convention for tobacco control or fctc the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda 

  

for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation in addition the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and appeal of tobacco products to adult smokers 

  

regulatory initiatives affecting our tobacco subsidiaries that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

partly because of some or a combination of these measures unit sales of tobacco products in certain markets principally western europe and japan have been in general decline and pmi expects this trend to continue pmi’s operating income could be significantly affected by any significant decrease in demand for its products any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements and requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products 

  

excise taxes  tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states and to substantial taxation abroad significant increases in tobacco productrelated taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states the member states of the european union the “eu” and in other foreign jurisdictions for example legislation was passed by the united states congress in 2007 that would increase the federal excise tax on cigarettes by 061 a pack the president vetoed this legislation it is not possible to predict whether such legislation will be reintroduced and become law in addition in certain jurisdictions pmi’s products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premium priced products and manufactured cigarettes and to inconsistent rulings and interpretations on complex methodologies to determine excise and other tax burdens 

  

tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our tobacco products due to lower consumption levels and to a shift in consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products 

  

minimum retail selling price laws  several eu member states have enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and in some cases other tobacco products the european 

  

commission has commenced infringement proceedings against these member states claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe eu law if the european commission’s actions are successful they could adversely impact excise tax levels andor price gaps in those markets 

  

increased competition in the united states tobacco market  settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain united states and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands 

  

international competition  pmi competes primarily on the basis of product quality taste brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price pmi is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its business the competitive environment and pmi’s competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors’ introduction of low priced products or innovative products higher cigarette taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories and products regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances governmentowned tobacco monopolies principally in the prc egypt thailand taiwan and algeria industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental monopolies have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 

  

counterfeit cigarettes in international markets  large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market pmi believes that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although pmi cannot quantify the amount of revenue it loses as a result of this activity in addition pmi’s revenues are reduced by contraband and legal crossborder transactions 

  

governmental investigations  from time to time alg and its tobacco subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters ongoing investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain international markets and false or misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our tobacco subsidiaries’ businesses could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 

  

new tobacco product technologies  our tobacco subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that may reduce the risk of tobacco use while continuing to offer adult consumers products that meet their taste expectations potential solutions being researched include attempting to reduce constituents in tobacco smoke identified by public health authorities as harmful and seeking to produce products that reduce or eliminate exposure to tobacco smoke our tobacco subsidiaries may not succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors do our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of products with claims of reduced risk to consumers which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of any products that might be developed 

  

adjacency strategy  alg pm usa and pmi have adjacency growth strategies involving moves and potential moves into complementary tobacco or tobaccorelated products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful 

  

foreign currency  pmi conducts its business in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting its results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars during periods of economic crises internationally foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing pmi’s margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position for pmi 

  

tobacco availability and quality  government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the quality of tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products as with other agriculture commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including governmental mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our tobacco subsidiaries’ profitability and business 

  

attracting and retaining talent  our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking the tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result our tobacco subsidiaries may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

  

competition and economic downturns  each of our tobacco subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and local economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the willingness of consumers to purchase premium cigarette brands depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label and other economy brands and the volume of our consumer products subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if counterparties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

acquisitions  one element of pmi’s growth strategy is to strengthen its brand portfolio andor expand its geographic reach through active programs of selective acquisitions alg and pm usa from time to time consider acquisitions as part of their adjacency strategy as evidenced by alg’s 2007 acquisition of john middleton inc acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that all future acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  

asset impairment  we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by the market conditions noted above as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the irs concluded its examination of altria group inc’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999 and issued a final revenue agent’s report “rar” on march 15 2006 the rar disallowed benefits pertaining to certain pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 altria group inc has agreed with all conclusions of the rar with the exception of the disallowance of benefits pertaining to several pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 pmcc will continue to assert its position regarding these leveraged lease transactions and contest approximately 150 million of tax and net interest assessed and paid with regard to them the irs may in the future challenge and disallow more of pmcc’s leveraged leases based on revenue rulings an irs notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases leaseinleaseout “lilo” and saleinleaseout “silo” transactions pmcc believes that the position and supporting case law described in the rar revenue rulings and the irs notice are incorrectly applied to pmcc’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the irs’s position pmcc and alg intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position through litigation in this regard on october 16 2006 pmcc filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york to claim refunds for a portion of these tax payments and associated interest however should pmcc’s position not be upheld pmcc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year pmcc considered this matter in its adoption of fin 48 and fasb staff position no fas 132

engle class action 

  

in july 2000 in the second phase of the engle smoking and health class action in florida a jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages totaling approximately 145 billion against various defendants including 74 billion against pm usa following entry of judgment pm usa posted a bond in the amount of 100 million and appealed 

  

in may 2001 the trial court approved a stipulation providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the engle judgment will remain stayed against pm usa and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review as a result of the stipulation pm usa placed 500 million into a separate interestbearing escrow account that regardless of the outcome of the judicial review will be paid to the court and the court will determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with florida rules of civil procedure in july 2001 pm usa also placed 12 billion into an interestbearing escrow account which was returned to pm usa in december 2007 in addition the 100 million bond related to the case has been discharged the 12 billion escrow account and the deposit of 100 million related to the bonding requirement were included in the december 31 2006 consolidated balance sheet as other assets interest income on the 12 billion escrow account prior to its return to pm usa was paid to pm usa quarterly and was being recorded as earned in interest and other debt expense net in the consolidated statements of earnings in connection with the stipulation pm usa recorded a 500 million pretax charge in its consolidated statement of earnings for the quarter ended march 31 2001 in may 2003 the florida third district court of appeal reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class plaintiffs petitioned the florida supreme court for further review 

  

in july 2006 the florida supreme court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated that the class approved by the trial court be decertified and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate the court further declared the following phase i findings are entitled to “res judicata” effect in such individual actions brought within one year of the issuance of the mandate i that smoking causes various diseases ii that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive iii that defendants’ cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous iv that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking v that all defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their detriment vi that defendants agreed to 

  

conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment vii that all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective and viii that all defendants were negligent the court also reinstated compensatory damage awards totaling approximately 69 million to two individual plaintiffs and found that a third plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations on february 8 2008 pm usa paid a total of 2964685 which represents its shares of compensatory damages and interest to the two individual plaintiffs identified in the florida supreme court’s order 

  

in august 2006 pm usa sought rehearing from the florida supreme court on parts of its july 2006 opinion including the ruling described above that certain jury findings have res judicata effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by engle class members the rehearing motion also asked among other things that legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the third district court of appeal or in the florida supreme court now be addressed plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in august 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability of the statute of limitations to nonmembers of the decertified class in december 2006 the florida supreme court refused to revise its july 2006 ruling except that it revised the set of phase i findings entitled to res judicata effect by excluding finding v listed above relating to agreement to misrepresent information and added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that at the time of sale or supply did not conform to the representations of fact made by defendants on january 11 2007 the florida supreme court issued the mandate from its revised opinion defendants then filed a motion with the florida third district court of appeal requesting that the court address legal errors that were previously raised by defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the third district or by the florida supreme court in february 2007 the third district court of appeal denied defendants’ motion in may 2007 defendants’ motion for a partial stay of the mandate pending the completion of appellate review was denied by the third district court of appeal in may 2007 defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court on october 1 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition in november 2007 the united states supreme court denied defendants’ petition for rehearing from the denial of their petition for writ of certiorari 

  

by the january 11 2008 deadline required by the florida supreme court’s decision approximately 1540 cases had been served upon pm usa or alg asserting individual claims on or on behalf of approximately 8016 plaintiffs it is possible that some of these cases are duplicates and additional cases have been filed but not yet recorded on the courts’ dockets some of these cases have been removed from various florida state courts to the federal district courts in florida while others were filed in federal court in july 2007 pm usa and other defendants requested that the multidistrict litigation panel order the transfer of all such cases pending in the federal courts as well as any other engle progeny cases that may be filed to the middle district of florida for pretrial coordination the panel denied this request in december 2007 in october 2007 attorneys for plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate all pending and future cases filed in the state trial court in hillsborough county the court denied this motion in november 2007 on february 14 2008 the trial court decertified the class and formally vacated the punitive damage award pursuant to the florida supreme court’s mandate 

  

scott class action 

  

in july 2003 following the first phase of the trial in the scott class action in which plaintiffs sought creation of a fund to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs a louisiana jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants including pm usa in connection with plaintiffs’ medical monitoring claims but also found that plaintiffs could benefit from smoking cessation assistance the jury also found that cigarettes as designed are not defective but that the defendants failed to disclose all they knew about smoking and diseases and marketed their products to minors in may 2004 in the second phase of the trial the jury awarded plaintiffs approximately 590 million against all defendants jointly and severally to fund a 10year smoking cessation program 

  

in june 2004 the court entered judgment which awarded plaintiffs the approximately 590 million jury award plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date the suit commenced as of february 15 2007 the amount of prejudgment interest was approximately 444 million pm usa’s share of the jury award and prejudgment interest has not been allocated defendants including pm usa appealed pursuant to a stipulation of the parties the trial court entered an order setting the amount of the bond at 50 million for all defendants in accordance with an article of the louisiana code of civil procedure and a louisiana statute the “bond cap law” fixing the amount of security in civil cases involving a signatory to the msa as defined below under the terms of the stipulation plaintiffs reserve the right to contest at a later date the sufficiency or amount of the bond on any grounds including the applicability or constitutionality of the bond cap law in september 2004 defendants collectively posted a bond in the amount of 50 million 

  

in february 2007 the louisiana court of appeal issued a ruling on defendants’ appeal that among other things affirmed class certification but limited the scope of the class struck certain of the categories of damages that comprised the judgment reducing the amount of the award by approximately 312 million vacated the award of prejudgment interest which totaled approximately 444 million as of february 15 2007 and ruled that the only class members who are eligible to participate in the smoking cessation program are those who began smoking before and whose claims accrued by september 1 1988 as a result the louisiana court of appeal remanded for proceedings consistent with its opinion including further reduction of the amount of the award based on the size of the new class in march 2007 the louisiana court of appeal rejected defendants’ motion for rehearing and clarification in january 2008 the louisiana supreme court denied plaintiffs’ and defendants’ petitions for writ of certiorari following the louisiana supreme court’s denial of defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari pm usa recorded a provision of 26 million in connection with the case

smoking and health class actions 

  

since the dismissal in may 1996 of a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of allegedly addicted smokers plaintiffs have filed numerous putative smoking and health class action suits in various state and federal courts in general these cases purport to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or states although a few cases purport to be nationwide in scope and raise addiction claims and in many cases claims of physical injury as well

health care cost recovery litigation 

  

overview 

  

in health care cost recovery litigation domestic and foreign governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  

the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  

defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  

although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and six state appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals 

  

in march 1999 in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial an ohio jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts in addition a 178 million verdict against defendants including 68 million against pm usa was reversed in a health care cost recovery case in new york and all claims were dismissed with prejudice in february 2005  blue crossblue shield  the trial in the health care cost recovery case brought by the city of st louis missouri and approximately 50 missouri hospitals in which pm usa and alg are defendants is scheduled to begin in january 2010 

  

individuals and associations have also sued in purported class actions or as private attorneys general under the medicare as secondary payer statute to recover from defendants medicare expenditures allegedly incurred for the treatment of smokingrelated diseases cases brought in new york  mason  florida  glover  and massachusetts  united seniors association  have been dismissed by federal courts and plaintiffs’ appealed in united seniors association  in august 2007 the united states court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in united seniors association  in november 2007 plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court which was denied on january 22 2008 

  

in addition to the cases brought in the united states health care cost recovery actions have also been brought against tobacco industry participants including pm usa pmi and certain pmi subsidiaries in israel 1 the marshall islands 1 dismissed canada 1 france 1 dismissed spain 1 and nigeria 5 and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions in september 2005 in the case in canada the canadian supreme court ruled that legislation passed in british columbia permitting the lawsuit is constitutional and as a result the case which had previously been dismissed by the trial court was permitted to proceed pm usa pmi and other defendants’ challenge to the british columbia court’s exercise of jurisdiction was rejected by the court of appeals of british columbia and in april 2007 the supreme court of canada denied review of that decision several other provinces in canada have enacted similar legislation or are in the process of enacting similar legislation 

  

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  

in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the original participating manufacturers make substantial annual payments of 94 billion each year excluding future annual payments if any under the national tobacco grower settlement trust discussed below subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume in addition the original participating manufacturers are required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million 

  

the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  

possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003 2004 and 2005 

  

pursuant to the provisions of the msa domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa who are original signatories to the msa original participating manufacturers “opms” are participating in proceedings that may result in downward adjustments to the amounts paid by the opms and the other msa participating manufacturers to the states and territories that are parties to the msa for the years 2003 2004 and 2005 the proceedings are based on the collective loss of market share for 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively by all manufacturers who are subject to the payment obligations and marketing restrictions of the msa to nonparticipating manufacturers “npms” who are not subject to such obligations and restrictions 

  

in these proceedings an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the msa parties is required to determine whether the disadvantages of the msa were a “significant factor” contributing to the collective loss of market share for the year in question if the firm determines that the disadvantages of the msa were such a “significant factor” each state may avoid a downward adjustment to its share of the participating manufacturers’ annual payments for that year by establishing that it diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during the entirety of that year any potential downward adjustment would then be reallocated to those states that do not establish such diligent enforcement pm usa believes that the msa’s arbitration clause requires a state to submit its claim to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute to binding arbitration before a panel of three former federal judges in the manner provided for in the msa a number of states have taken the position that this claim should be decided in state court on a statebystate basis 

  

in march of 2006 an independent economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2003 in february 2007 this same firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2004 in february 2008 the same economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2005 following the economic consulting firm’s determination with respect to 2003 thirtyeight states filed declaratory judgment actions in state courts seeking a declaration that the state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers have responded to these actions by filing motions to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the msa including filing motions to compel arbitration in eleven msa states and territories that have not filed declaratory judgment actions courts in over 45 states have ruled that the question of whether a state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 is subject to arbitration and only one state court ruling to the contrary currently stands and it remains subject to appeal many of these rulings including the one ruling against arbitration remain subject to appeal or further review additionally ohio filed a declaratory judgment action in state court with respect to the 2004 diligent enforcement issue the action has been stayed pending the decision about the 2003 payments 

  

the availability and the precise amount of any npm adjustment for 2003 2004 and 2005 will not be finally determined until late 2008 or thereafter there is no certainty that the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers will ultimately receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings if the opms do receive such an adjustment through these proceedings the adjustment would be allocated among the opms pursuant to the msa’s provisions and pm usa’s share would likely be applied as a credit against a future msa payment 

  

national grower settlement trust 

  

as part of the msa the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobaccogrowing states to address concerns about the potential adverse economic impact of the msa on 

  

tobacco growers and quota holders to that end in 1999 four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa established the national tobacco grower settlement trust “ntgst” a trust fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quota holders the trust was to be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments prior to application of various adjustments scheduled to total 515 billion provisions of the ntgst allowed for offsets to the extent that industryfunded payments were made for the benefit of growers or quota holders as part of a legislated end to the federal tobacco quota and price support program 

  

in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout which is estimated at approximately 95 billion is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the quota buyout payments offset already scheduled payments to the ntgst however two of the grower states maryland and pennsylvania have filed claims in the north carolina state courts asserting that the companies which established the ntgst including pm usa must continue making payments under the ntgst through 2010 for the benefit of maryland and pennsylvania growers such continuing payments would represent slightly more than one percent of the originally scheduled payments that would have been due to the ntgst for the years 2005 through 2010 notwithstanding the offsets resulting from the fetra payments the north carolina trial court has held in favor of maryland and pennsylvania and the companies including pm usa have appealed in addition to the approximately 95 billion cost of the buyout fetra also obligated manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government incurred on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program pm usa has paid 138 million for its share of the tobacco pool stock losses the quota buyout did not have a material adverse impact on alg’s consolidated results in 2007 alg does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2008 and beyond 

  

other msarelated litigation 

  

in june 2004 a putative class of california smokers filed a complaint against pm usa and the msa’s other opms seeking damages from the opms for postmsa price increases and an injunction against their continued compliance with the msa’s terms the complaint alleges that the msa and related legislation protect the opms from competition in a manner that violates federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws the complaint also names the california attorney general as a defendant and seeks to enjoin him from enforcing california’s escrow statute in march 2005 the united states district court for the northern district of california granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the case in september 2007 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the dismissal on january 25 2008 plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court 

  

without naming pm usa or any other private party as a defendant manufacturers that have elected not to sign the msa “nonparticipating manufacturers” or “npms” andor their distributors or customers have filed several other legal challenges to the msa and related legislation new york state officials are defendants in a lawsuit pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in which cigarette importers allege that the msa andor related legislation violates federal antitrust laws and the commerce clause of the united states constitution in a separate proceeding pending in the same court plaintiffs assert the same theories against not only new york officials but also the attorneys general for thirty other states the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has held that the allegations in both actions if proven establish a basis for relief on antitrust and commerce clause grounds and that the trial courts in new york have personal jurisdiction 

  

sufficient to enjoin other states’ officials from enforcing their msarelated legislation on remand in those two actions one trial judge preliminarily enjoined new york from enforcing its “allocable share” amendment to the msa’s model escrow statute against the plaintiffs while another trial judge refused to do so after concluding that the plaintiffs were unlikely to prove their allegations summary judgment motions are pending in one of those cases 

  

in another action the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed a trial court’s dismissal of challenges to msarelated legislation in louisiana under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution the case will now proceed to motions for summary judgment and if necessary a trial summary judgment proceedings in another challenge to louisiana’s participation in the msa and its msarelated legislation may begin in mid2008 yet another proceeding has been initiated before an international arbitration tribunal under the provisions of the north american free trade agreement appeals from trial court decisions holding that plaintiffs have failed either to make allegations establishing a claim for relief or to submit evidence supporting those allegations are currently or will soon be pending before the united states court of appeals for the eighth and tenth circuits the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit has affirmed the dismissal of two similar challenges 

  

federal government’s lawsuit 

  

in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others including alg asserting claims under three federal statutes the medical care recovery act “mcra” the medicare secondary payer “msp” provisions of the social security act and the civil provisions of rico trial of the case ended in june 2005 the lawsuit sought to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobaccorelated illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs including medicare military and veterans’ health benefits programs and the federal employees health benefits program the complaint alleged that such costs total more than 20 billion annually it also sought what it alleged to be equitable and declaratory relief including disgorgement of profits which arose from defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct in september 2000 the trial court dismissed the government’s mcra and msp claims but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief under the civil provisions of rico 

  

the government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2004 the trial court issued an order denying defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy in february 2005 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under the civil provisions of rico and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim in april 2005 the court of appeals denied the government’s motion for rehearing in july 2005 the government petitioned the united states supreme court for further review of the court of appeals’ ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy and in october 2005 the supreme court denied the petition 

  

in june 2005 the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment seeking remedies of approximately 14 billion including 10 billion over a fiveyear period to fund a national smoking cessation program and 4 billion over a tenyear period to fund a public education and countermarketing campaign further the government’s proposed remedy would have required defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 are not achieved according to a prescribed timetable the government’s proposed remedies also included a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business 

  

operations — including but not limited to restrictions on advertising and marketing potential measures with respect to certain price promotional activities and research and development disclosure requirements for certain confidential data and implementation of a monitoring system with potential broad powers over cigarette operations 

  

in august 2006 the federal trial court entered judgment in favor of the government the court held that certain defendants including alg and pm usa violated rico and engaged in 7 of the 8 “subschemes” to defraud that the government had alleged specifically the court found that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the court did not impose monetary penalties on the defendants but ordered the following relief i an injunction against “committing any act of racketeering” relating to the manufacturing marketing promotion health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states ii an injunction against participating directly or indirectly in the management or control of the council for tobacco research the tobacco institute or the center for indoor air research or any successor or affiliated entities of each iii an injunction against “making or causing to be made in any way any material false misleading or deceptive statement or representation or engaging in any public relations or marketing endeavor that is disseminated to the united states public and that misrepresents or suppresses information concerning cigarettes” iv an injunction against conveying any express or implied health message through use of descriptors on cigarette packaging or in cigarette advertising or promotional material including “lights” “ultra lights” and “low tar” which the court found could cause consumers to believe a cigarette brand is less hazardous than another brand v the issuance of “corrective statements” in various media regarding the adverse health effects of smoking the addictiveness of smoking and nicotine the lack of any significant health benefit from smoking “low tar” or “light” cigarettes defendants’ manipulation of cigarette design to ensure optimum nicotine delivery and the adverse health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke vi the disclosure on defendants’ public document websites and in the minnesota document repository of all documents produced to the government in the lawsuit or produced in any future court or administrative action concerning smoking and health until 2021 with certain additional requirements as to documents withheld from production under a claim of privilege or confidentiality vii the disclosure of disaggregated marketing data to the government in the same form and on the same schedule as defendants now follow in disclosing such data to the federal trade commission for a period of ten years viii certain restrictions on the sale or transfer by defendants of any cigarette brands brand names formulas or cigarette businesses within the united states and ix payment of the government’s costs in bringing the action 

  

in september 2006 defendants filed notices of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in september 2006 the trial court denied defendants’ motion to stay the judgment pending defendants’ appeals and defendants then filed an emergency motion with the court of appeals to stay enforcement of the judgment pending their appeals in october 2006 the government filed a notice of appeal to the court of appeals in which it appeals the denial of certain 

  

remedies including the disgorgement of profits and the cessation remedies it had sought in october 2006 a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals granted defendants’ motion and stayed the trial court’s judgment pending its review of the decision certain defendants including pm usa and alg filed a motion to clarify the trial court’s august 2006 final judgment and remedial order in march 2007 the trial court denied in part and granted in part defendants’ posttrial motion for clarification of portions of the court’s remedial order as noted above the trial court’s judgment and remedial order remain stayed pending the appeal to the court of appeals in may 2007 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia scheduled briefing of the parties’ consolidated appeal to begin in august 2007 and conclude in may 2008

various jurisdictions in february 2002 the federal district court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss the actions in january 2004 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the dismissals of the cases based on the common law revenue rule which bars a foreign government from bringing civil claims in us courts for the recovery of lost taxes it is possible that future litigation related to cigarette contraband issues may be brought in this regard alg believes that canadian authorities are contemplating a legal proceeding based on an investigation of alg entities relating to allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes into canada in the early to mid1990s 

  

cases under the california business and professions code  in june 1997 and july 1998 two suits  brown and daniels  were filed in california state court alleging that domestic cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others have violated california business and professions code sections 17200 and 17500 regarding unfair unlawful and fraudulent business practices class certification was granted in both cases as to plaintiffs’ claims that class members are entitled to reimbursement of the costs of cigarettes purchased during the class periods and injunctive relief in september 2002 the court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to all claims in one of the cases  daniels  and plaintiffs appealed in october 2004 the california fourth district court of appeal affirmed the trial court’s ruling and also denied plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing in february 2005 the california supreme court agreed to hear plaintiffs’ appeal in august 2007 the california supreme court affirmed the dismissal of the daniels class action on federal preemption grounds in december 2007 plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court

certain other actions 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the irs concluded its examination of alg’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999 and issued a final revenue agent’s report “rar” on march 15 2006 the rar disallowed benefits pertaining to certain pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 altria group inc has agreed with all conclusions of the rar with the exception of the disallowance of benefits pertaining to several pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 pmcc will continue to assert its position regarding these leveraged lease transactions and contest approximately 150 million of tax and net interest assessed and paid with regard to them the irs may in the future challenge and disallow more of pmcc’s leveraged leases based on revenue rulings an irs notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases leaseinleaseout “lilo” and saleinleaseout “silo” transactions pmcc believes that the position and supporting case law described in the rar revenue rulings and the irs notice are incorrectly applied to pmcc’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the irs’s position pmcc and alg intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position through litigation in this regard on october 16 2006 pmcc filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york to claim refunds for a portion of these tax payments and associated interest however should pmcc’s position not be upheld pmcc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year pmcc considered this matter in its adoption of fasb interpretation no 48 and fasb staff position no fas 132 

  

  

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 42 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all 

  

alg and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings  at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any 

  

it is possible that pm usa’s or altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty management believes the litigation environment has substantially improved alg and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has a number of valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however alg and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of alg’s stockholders to do so 

  

thirdparty guarantees 

  

at december 31 2007 altria group inc’s thirdparty guarantees which are primarily related to excise taxes and divestiture activities were 72 million of which 67 million have no specified expiration dates the remainder expire through 2011 with none expiring during 2008 altria group inc is required to perform under these guarantees in the event that a third party fails to make contractual payments or achieve performance measures altria group inc has a liability of 22 million on its consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 relating to these guarantees for the remainder of these guarantees there is no liability on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 as the fair value of these guarantees is insignificant due to the fact that the probability of future payments under these guarantees is remote in the ordinary course of business certain subsidiaries of alg have agreed to indemnify a limited number of third parties in the event of future litigation

holders of altria group inc stock options will be treated similarly to public stockholders and will accordingly have their stock awards split into two instruments holders of altria group inc stock options will receive the following stock options which immediately after the spinoff will have an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the prespin altria group inc options 

  

   

   

holders of altria group inc restricted stock or stock rights awarded prior to january 31 2007 will retain their existing award and will receive restricted stock or stock rights of kraft class a common stock the amount of kraft restricted stock or stock rights awarded to such holders will be calculated using the same formula set forth above with respect to new kraft options all of the restricted stock and stock rights will not vest until the completion of the original restriction period typically three years from the date of the original grant recipients of altria group inc stock rights awarded on january 31 2007 did not receive restricted stock or stock rights of kraft rather they will receive additional stock rights of altria group inc to preserve the intrinsic value of the original award

kraft is currently included in the altria group inc consolidated federal income tax return and federal income tax contingencies are recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet of alg prior to the distribution of kraft shares alg will reimburse kraft in cash for these liabilities which are approximately 300 million plus interest 

  

a subsidiary of alg currently provides kraft with certain services at cost plus a 5 management fee after the distribution date kraft will undertake these activities and any remaining limited services provided to kraft will cease in 2007 all intercompany accounts will be settled in cash within 30 days of the distribution date

pm usa sells its tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services subsidiaries and affiliates of pmi and their licensees sell their tobacco products worldwide to distributors wholesalers retailers stateowned enterprises and other customers 

  

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality price marketing and packaging constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts including coupons product promotions and allowances for new products the tobacco products of alg’s subsidiaries affiliates and their licensees are advertised and promoted through various media although television and radio advertising of cigarettes is prohibited in the united states and is prohibited or restricted in most other countries in addition as discussed below in item 3 legal proceedings pm usa and other domestic tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions

tobacco production in the united states has been subject to government controls including the production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quotaholders the cost of the buyout to the industry is estimated at approximately 95 billion and is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products the quota buyout payments will offset already scheduled payments to the national tobacco grower settlement trust the “ntgst” see item 3 legal proceedings health care cost recovery litigation – national grower 

  

settlement trust for a discussion of the ntgst manufacturers and importers of tobacco products are also obligated to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government may incur on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program in 2005 pm usa recorded a 138 million expense for its share of the loss altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2007 and beyond 

  

in addition oriental fluecured and burley tobaccos are purchased outside the united states tobacco production outside the united states is subject to a variety of controls and external factors which may include tobacco subsidies and tobacco production control programs all of those controls and programs may substantially affect market prices for tobacco 

  

pm usa and pmi believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

knac’s products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating food products are distributed through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities most distribution in north america is in the form of warehouse delivery but biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two directstore delivery systems kraft supports its selling efforts through three principal sets of activities consumer advertising in broadcast print outdoor and online media consumer promotions such as coupons and contests and trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of products by customers subsidiaries and affiliates of kic sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents 

  

kraft is subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of its business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors may have different profit objectives and some competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates kraft’s food products also compete with generic products and privatelabel products of 

  

food retailers wholesalers and cooperatives kraft competes primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand’s market position or to introduce a new product 

  

kraft is a major purchaser of milk cheese nuts green coffee beans cocoa corn products wheat pork poultry beef vegetable oil and sugar and other sweeteners it also uses significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard to package its products kraft continuously monitors worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities to enable it to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

  

kraft purchases a substantial portion of its dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government programs as well as by market supply and demand dairy commodity costs on average were lower in 2006 than in 2005 

  

the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply trade agreements among producing and consuming nations the unilateral policies of the producing nations changes in the value of the united states dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products in 2006 coffee bean costs on average were higher than in 2005 

  

a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound sterling and the united states dollar relative to certain other currencies in 2006 cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were lower than in 2005 

  

during 2006 aggregate commodity costs continued to rise for kraft with significant impacts resulting from higher energy packaging and coffee costs partially offset by lower yearoveryear cheese and meat costs for 2006 pretax aggregate commodity costs increased by approximately 275 million from 2005 following an increase of approximately 800 million for 2005 compared with 2004 kraft expects the higher cost environment to continue particularly for energy and packaging 

  

the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in kraft’s food products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors kraft believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources kraft uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials however kraft does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect kraft from increases in specific raw material costs 

  

regulation 

  

all of knac’s united states food products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the food and drug administration the “fda” or with respect to products containing meat and poultry the food safety and inspection service of the usda among other things these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated foods establish safety standards for food processing establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods establish standards of identity for certain foods determine the safety of food additives and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products 

  

in addition states enforce food laws such as regulating the business of knac’s operating units by licensing plants enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

  

many of the food commodities on which knac’s united states businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review 

  

almost all of the activities of kraft’s operations outside of the united states are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to knac’s united states businesses and in some cases international regulatory provisions such as those of the european union the “eu” regarding labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

  

the eu and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled accordingly other countries may adopt similar regulations the fda has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current united states law

financial services 

  

pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities total assets of pmcc were 68 billion at december 31 2006 down from 74 billion at december 31 2005 reflecting a decrease in finance assets net due to asset sales in 2003 pmcc shifted its strategic focus and is no longer making new investments but is instead focused on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities accordingly pmcc’s operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold pmcc’s finance asset portfolio includes leases in the following investment categories electric power aircraft rail and surface transport manufacturing and real estate industries finance assets net are comprised of total lease payments receivable and the residual value of assets under lease reduced by thirdparty nonrecourse debt and unearned income the payment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to all other assets of pmcc or altria group inc as required by accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the thirdparty nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rentals receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net in altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets 

  

during 2006 2005 and 2004 pmcc received proceeds from asset sales and maturities of 357 million 476 million and 644 million respectively and recorded gains of 132 million 72 million and 112 million respectively in operating companies income 

  

among its leasing activities pmcc leases a number of aircraft predominantly to major us passenger carriers at december 31 2006 19 billion of pmcc’s finance asset balance related to aircraft two of pmcc’s aircraft lessees delta air lines inc “delta” and northwest airlines inc 

  

“northwest” are currently under bankruptcy protection in addition pmcc leases one natural gasfired power plant to an indirect subsidiary of calpine corporation “calpine” calpine which has guaranteed the lease is currently operating under bankruptcy protection pmcc does not record income on leases in bankruptcy should a lease rejection or foreclosure occur it would result in the writeoff of the finance asset balance against pmcc’s allowance for losses and the acceleration of deferred tax payments on these leases at december 31 2006 pmcc’s finance asset balances for these leases were as follows 

  

   

   

   

at december 31 2006 pmcc’s allowance for losses was 480 million during the second quarter of 2006 pmcc increased its allowance for losses by 103 million due to continuing issues within the airline industry chargeoffs to the allowance for losses in 2006 totaled 219 million the acceleration of taxes on the foreclosures of northwest rj85s and six aircraft previously financed under leveraged leases with united air lines inc “united” written off in the first quarter of 2006 upon united’s emergence from bankruptcy totaled approximately 80 million foreclosures on delta and calpine tiverton  rumford leveraged leases will result in the acceleration of previously deferred taxes of approximately 180 million 

  

in the third quarter 2005 pmcc recorded a provision for losses of 200 million due to continuing uncertainty within its airline portfolio and bankruptcy filings by delta and northwest as a result of this provision pmcc’s fixed charges coverage ratio did not meet its 1251 requirement under a support agreement with alg accordingly as required by the support agreement a support payment of 150 million was made by alg to pmcc in september 2005 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2004 pmcc recorded a provision for losses of 140 million for its airline industry exposure during 2006 2005 and 2004 chargeoffs to the allowance for losses were 219 million 101 million and 39 million respectively it is possible that additional adverse developments may require pmcc to increase its allowance for losses 

  

the irs concluded its examination of alg’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999 and issued a final revenue agent’s report “rar” on march 15 2006 the rar disallowed benefits pertaining to certain pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 altria group inc has agreed with all conclusions of the rar with the exception of the disallowance of benefits pertaining to several pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 

  

pmcc will continue to assert its position regarding these leveraged lease transactions and contest approximately 150 million of tax and net interest assessed and paid with regard to them the irs may in the future challenge and disallow more of pmcc’s leveraged leases based on recent revenue rulings a recent irs notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases leaseinleaseout “lilo” and saleinleaseout “silo” transactions pmcc believes that the position and supporting case law described in the rar revenue rulings and the irs notice are incorrectly applied to pmcc’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the irs’s position pmcc and alg intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position through litigation in this regard on october 16 2006 pmcc filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york to claim refunds for a portion of these tax payments and associated interest and intends to file complaints for the remainder however should pmcc’s position not be upheld pmcc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year pmcc considered this matter in its adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” and fasb staff position no fas 132 “accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction”

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report 

  

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time 

  

tobaccorelated litigation  there is substantial litigation related to tobacco products in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 40 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all 

  

it is possible that altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty management believes the litigation environment has substantially improved alg and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has a number of valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however alg and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of alg’s stockholders to do so please see note 19 for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

    

corporate restructuring  on january 31 2007 the board of directors of alg authorized the distribution of all kraft shares owned by alg to alg’s shareholders the distribution will be made on march 30 2007 to alg shareholders of record as of 500 pm eastern time on march 16 2007 it is possible that an action may be brought seeking to enjoin the spinoff any such injunction would have to be based on a finding that altria is insolvent or would be insolvent after giving effect to the spinoff or intends to delay hinder or defraud creditors in the event the spinoff is challenged alg will defend such action vigorously including by prosecuting any necessary appeals although litigation is subject to uncertainty management believes that altria should ultimately prevail against any such action 

  

tobacco control action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking and seeking to hold us responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect this decline to continue 

  

excise taxes  cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states and to substantial taxation abroad significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes and fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states the eu and in other foreign jurisdictions in addition in certain jurisdictions pmi’s products are subject to discriminatory tax structures and inconsistent rulings and interpretations on complex methodologies to determine excise and other tax burdens 

  

tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes by our tobacco subsidiaries due to lower consumption levels and to a shift in consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit or contraband products 

  

minimum retail selling price laws  several eu member states have enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and in some cases other tobacco products the european commission has commenced proceedings against these member states claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe eu law if the european commission’s infringement actions are successful they could adversely impact excise tax levels andor price gaps in those markets 

  

increased competition in the domestic tobacco market  settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain domestic and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales by concentrating on certain states where escrow deposits are not required or are required on fewer than all such manufacturers’ cigarettes sold in such states additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands 

  

counterfeit cigarettes in international markets  large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market pmi believes that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international brand pmi cannot quantify the amount of revenue it loses as a result of this activity 

  

governmental investigations  from time to time alg and its tobacco subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters ongoing investigations include allegations of 

  

contraband shipments of cigarettes and allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain international markets we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 

  

new tobacco product technologies  our tobacco subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that have the objective of reducing constituents in tobacco smoke identified by public health authorities as harmful while continuing to offer adult smokers products that meet their taste expectations we cannot guarantee that our tobacco subsidiaries will succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors do our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

  

  

pm usa and pmi have adjacency growth strategies involving potential moves into complementary tobacco or tobaccorelated products or processes we cannot guarantee that these strategies or any products introduced in connection with these strategies will be successful 

  

foreign currency  our international food and tobacco subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting their results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

  

competition and economic downturns  each of our consumer products subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and local economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the willingness of consumers to purchase premium cigarette brands and premium food and beverage brands depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label and other economy brands and the volume of our consumer products subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if counterparties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

grocery trade consolidation  as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers grow larger and become more sophisticated they demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs further these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products if kraft fails to use its scale marketing expertise branded products and category leadership positions to respond to these trends its volume growth could slow or it may need to lower prices or increase promotional support of its products any of which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

continued need to add food and beverage products in faster growing and more profitable categories  the food and beverage industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth kraft’s success depends in part on its ability to grow its business faster than populations are growing in the markets that it serves one way to achieve that growth is to enhance its portfolio by adding products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories if kraft does not succeed in making these enhancements its volume growth may slow which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

strengthening brand portfolios through acquisitions and divestitures  one element of the growth strategy of our consumer product subsidiaries is to strengthen their brand portfolios andor expand their geographic reach through active programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures these subsidiaries are constantly investigating potential acquisition candidates and from time to time they may sell businesses that are outside their core categories or that do not meet their growth or profitability targets acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that all future acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  

food raw material prices  the raw materials used by our food businesses are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging costs which are significantly affected by oil costs and our operating subsidiaries may be unable to increase their prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume net revenues and operating companies income we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not work as planned 

  

food safety quality and health concerns  we could be adversely affected if consumers in kraft’s principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying kraft’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions recent publicity concerning the health implications of obesity and trans fatty acids could also reduce consumption of certain of kraft’s products in addition kraft may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or misbranded kraft may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause products to be unavailable for a period of time and a loss of consumer confidence in kraft’s food products and could have a material adverse effect on kraft’s business and results 

  

asset impairment  we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by the market conditions noted above as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases the irs concluded its examination of alg’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999 and issued a final revenue agent’s report “rar” on march 15 2006 the rar disallowed benefits pertaining to certain pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 altria group inc has agreed with all conclusions of the rar with the exception of the disallowance of benefits pertaining to several pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 pmcc will continue to assert its position regarding these leveraged lease transactions and contest approximately 150 million of tax and net interest assessed and paid with regard to them the irs may in the future challenge and disallow more of pmcc’s leveraged leases based on recent revenue rulings a recent irs notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases leaseinleaseout “lilo” and saleinleaseout 

  

“silo” transactions pmcc believes that the position and supporting case law described in the rar revenue rulings and the irs notice are incorrectly applied to pmcc’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the irs’s position pmcc and alg intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position through litigation in this regard on october 16 2006 pmcc filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york to claim refunds for a portion of these tax payments and associated interest and intends to file complaints for the remainder however should pmcc’s position not be upheld pmcc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year pmcc considered this matter in its adoption of fin 48 and fasb staff position no fas 132

engle class action 

  

in july 2000 in the second phase of the engle smoking and health class action in florida a jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages totaling approximately 145 billion against various defendants including 74 billion against pm usa following entry of judgment pm usa posted a bond in the amount of 100 million and appealed 

  

in may 2001 the trial court approved a stipulation providing that execution of the punitive damages component of the engle judgment will remain stayed against pm usa and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review as a result of the stipulation pm usa placed 500 million into a separate interestbearing escrow account that regardless of the outcome of the appeal will be paid to the court and the court will determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with florida rules of civil procedure in july 2001 pm usa also placed 12 billion into an interestbearing escrow account which will be returned to pm usa should it prevail in its appeal of the case the 12 billion escrow account is included in the december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 consolidated balance sheets as other assets interest income on the 12 billion escrow account is paid to pm usa quarterly and is being recorded as earned in interest and other debt expense net in the consolidated statements of earnings in connection with the stipulation pm usa recorded a 500 million pretax charge in its consolidated statement of earnings for the quarter ended march 31 2001 in may 2003 the florida third district court of appeal reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and instructed the trial court to order the decertification of the class plaintiffs petitioned the florida supreme court for further review 

  

in july 2006 the florida supreme court ordered that the punitive damages award be vacated that the class approved by the trial court be decertified and that members of the decertified class could file individual actions against defendants within one year of issuance of the mandate the court further declared the following phase i findings are entitled to res judicata effect in such individual actions brought within one year of the issuance of the mandate i that smoking causes various diseases ii that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive iii that defendants’ cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous iv that defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking v that all defendants agreed to misrepresent information regarding the health effects or addictive nature of cigarettes with the intention of causing the public to rely on this information to their detriment vi that defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers would rely on the information to their detriment vii that all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective and viii that all defendants were negligent the court also reinstated compensatory damage awards totaling approximately 69 million to two individual plaintiffs and found that a third plaintiff’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations it is too early to predict how many members of the decertified class will file individual claims in the prescribed time period 

  

in august 2006 pm usa sought rehearing from the florida supreme court on parts of its july 2006 opinion including the ruling described above that certain jury findings have res judicata effect in subsequent individual trials timely brought by engle class members the rehearing motion also asked among other things that legal errors that were raised but not expressly ruled upon in the third district court of appeal or in the florida supreme court now be addressed plaintiffs also filed a motion for rehearing in august 2006 seeking clarification of the applicability of the statute of limitations to nonmembers of the decertified class in december 2006 the florida supreme court refused to revise its july 2006 ruling except that it revised the set of phase i findings entitled to res judicata effect by excluding finding v listed above relating to agreement to misrepresent information and added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that at the time of sale or supply did not conform to the representations of fact made by defendants on january 11 2007 the florida supreme court issued the mandate from its revised opinion on january 12 2007 defendants filed a motion with the florida third district court of appeal requesting that the court address legal errors that were previously raised by defendants but have not yet been addressed either by the third district or by the florida supreme court on february 21 2007 the third district court of appeal denied defendants’ motion defendants intend to seek further appellate review 

  

scott class action 

  

in july 2003 following the first phase of the trial in the scott class action in which plaintiffs sought creation of a fund to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs a louisiana jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants including pm usa in connection with plaintiffs’ medical monitoring claims but also found that plaintiffs could benefit from smoking cessation assistance the jury also found that cigarettes as designed are not defective but that the defendants failed to disclose all they knew about smoking and diseases and marketed their products to minors in may 2004 in the second phase of the trial the jury awarded plaintiffs approximately 590 million against all defendants jointly and severally to fund a 10year smoking cessation program 

  

in june 2004 the court entered judgment which awarded plaintiffs the approximately 590 million jury award plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date the suit commenced as of february 15 2007 the amount of prejudgment interest was approximately 444 million pm usa’s share of the jury award and prejudgment interest has not been allocated defendants including pm usa appealed pursuant to a stipulation of the parties the trial court entered an order setting the amount of the bond at 50 million for all defendants in accordance with an article of the louisiana code of civil procedure 

  

and a louisiana statute the “bond cap law” fixing the amount of security in civil cases involving a signatory to the msa as defined below under the terms of the stipulation plaintiffs reserve the right to contest at a later date the sufficiency or amount of the bond on any grounds including the applicability or constitutionality of the bond cap law in september 2004 defendants collectively posted a bond in the amount of 50 million 

  

in february 2007 the louisiana court of appeal issued a ruling on defendants’ appeal that among other things affirmed class certification but limited the scope of the class struck certain of the categories of damages that comprised the judgment reducing the amount of the award by approximately 312 million vacated the award of prejudgment interest which totaled approximately 444 million as of february 15 2007 and ruled that the only class members who are eligible to participate in the smoking cessation program are those who began smoking before and whose claims accrued by september 1 1988 as a result the louisiana court of appeal remanded for proceedings consistent with its opinion including further reduction of the amount of the award based on the size of the new class defendants intend to seek further appellate review

health care cost recovery litigation 

  

overview 

  

in health care cost recovery litigation domestic and foreign governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  

the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  

defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust 

  

standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  

although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and six state appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals 

  

in march 1999 in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial an ohio jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts in addition a 178 million verdict against defendants including 68 million against pm usa was reversed in a health care cost recovery case in new york and all claims were dismissed with prejudice in february 2005  blue crossblue shield  the health care cost recovery case brought by the city of st louis missouri and approximately 50 missouri hospitals in which pm usa and alg are defendants remains pending without a trial date

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  

in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by 

  

mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the domestic tobacco industry make substantial annual payments in the following amounts excluding future annual payments under the national tobacco grower settlement trust discussed below subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume 2007 84 billion and thereafter 94 billion each year in addition the domestic tobacco industry is required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million 

  

the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  

possible adjustments in msa payments for 2003 and 2004 

  

pursuant to the provisions of the msa domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa who are original signatories to the msa “opms” are participating in proceedings that may result in downward adjustments to the amounts paid by the opms and the other msaparticipating manufacturers to the states and territories that are parties to the msa for the years 2003 and 2004 the proceedings are based on the collective loss of market share in each of 2003 and 2004 by all manufacturers who are subject to the payment obligations and marketing restrictions of the msa to nonparticipating manufacturers “npms” who are not subject to such obligations and restrictions 

  

in these proceedings an independent economic consulting firm jointly selected by the msa parties is required to determine whether the disadvantages of the msa were a “significant factor” contributing to the collective loss of market share for the year in question if the firm determines that the disadvantages of the msa were such a “significant factor” each state may avoid a downward adjustment to its share of the opms’ annual payments for that year by establishing that it diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute during the entirety of that year any potential downward adjustment would then be reallocated to those states that do not establish such diligent enforcement pm usa believes that the msa’s arbitration clause requires a state to submit its claim to have diligently enforced a qualifying escrow statute to binding arbitration before a panel of three former federal judges in the manner provided for in the msa a number of states have taken the position that this claim should be decided in state court on a statebystate basis 

  

in march of 2006 an independent economic consulting firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2003 on february 12 2007 this same firm determined that the disadvantages of the msa were a significant factor contributing to the participating manufacturers’ collective loss of market share for the year 2004 following the economic consulting firm’s determination with respect to 2003 thirtyeight states filed declaratory judgment actions in state courts seeking a declaration that the state diligently enforced its escrow statute during 2003 the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers have responded to these actions by filing motions to compel arbitration in accordance with the terms of the msa including filing motions to compel arbitration in eleven msa states and territories that have not filed declaratory judgment actions 

  

the issue of what forum will determine the states’ diligent enforcement claims and the availability and the precise amount of any npm adjustment for either 2003 or 2004 will not be finally determined until late 2007 or thereafter there is no certainty that the opms and other msaparticipating manufacturers will ultimately receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings if the opms do receive such an adjustment the adjustment would likely be applied as a credit against future msa payments and would be allocated among the opms pursuant to the msa’s provisions for allocation of the npm adjustment among the opms 

  

national grower settlement trust 

  

as part of the msa the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobaccogrowing states to address concerns about the potential adverse economic impact of the msa on tobacco growers and quota holders to that end in 1999 four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa established the national tobacco grower settlement trust “ntgst” a trust fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quota holders the trust was to be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments prior to application of various adjustments scheduled to total 515 billion provisions of the ntgst allowed for offsets to the extent that industryfunded payments were made for the benefit of growers or quota holders as part of a legislated end to the federal tobacco quota and price support program 

  

in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout which is estimated at approximately 95 billion is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product the quota buyout payments offset already scheduled payments to the ntgst fetra also obligated manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government incurred on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program pm usa has paid 138 million for its share of the tobacco pool stock losses alg does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2007 and beyond 

  

other msarelated litigation 

  

in april 2004 a lawsuit was filed in state court in los angeles california on behalf of all california residents who purchased cigarettes in california from april 2000 to the present alleging that the msa enabled the defendants including pm usa and alg to engage in unlawful price fixing and market sharing agreements the complaint sought damages and also sought to enjoin defendants from continuing to operate under those provisions of the msa that allegedly violate california law in june 2004 plaintiffs dismissed this case and refiled a substantially similar complaint in federal court in san francisco california the new complaint is brought on behalf of the same purported class but differs in that it covers purchases from june 2000 to the present names the attorney general of california as a defendant and does not name alg as a defendant in march 2005 the trial court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the case plaintiffs have appealed 

  

several actions are currently pending challenging the legality of various provisions of the msa under various theories neither alg nor pm usa is a party in these actions there is a suit pending against new york state officials in which importers of cigarettes allege that the msa and certain new york statutes enacted in connection with the msa violate federal antitrust and constitutional law the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has held that plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief on antitrust grounds in september 2004 the trial court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the msa and certain related new york statutes on the grounds that the plaintiffs were unlikely to prove their allegations but the court issued a preliminary injunction against an amendment repealing the “allocable share” provision of the new york escrow statute pending further discovery the parties’ motions for summary judgment are pending additionally in a separate proceeding pending in new york federal court plaintiffs seek to enjoin the statutes enacted by new york and 30 other states in connection with the msa on the grounds that the statutes violate the federal antitrust laws and the commerce clause of the united states constitution in september 2005 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit held that plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief and that the new york 

  

federal court had jurisdiction over the 30 defendant attorneys general from states other than new york and in october 2006 the united states supreme court denied the attorneys generals’ petition for writ of certiorari in may 2006 the district court denied plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction against enforcement of the escrow statute’s “complementary legislation” based on an inability to prove the facts alleged plaintiffs have appealed in march 2006 the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit reversed a louisiana trial court’s dismissal of federal constitutional challenges to certain provisions of the msa as a result the case will proceed to trial in federal court beginning in june 2007 similar lawsuits are pending in other states on similar antitrust commerce clause andor other constitutional theories including arkansas kansas louisiana oklahoma and tennessee a similar proceeding has been brought under the provisions of the north american free trade agreement in the united nations the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit recently affirmed the dismissal of an action in kentucky plaintiff in that case has petitioned the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit for rehearing en banc in addition appeals of cases raising similar constitutional and antitrust challenges to the msa are currently pending before the united states court of appeals for the second sixth and tenth circuits 

  

federal government’s lawsuit 

  

in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others including alg asserting claims under three federal statutes the medical care recovery act “mcra” the medicare secondary payer “msp” provisions of the social security act and the civil provisions of rico trial of the case ended in june 2005 the lawsuit sought to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobaccorelated illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs including medicare military and veterans’ health benefits programs and the federal employees health benefits program the complaint alleged that such costs total more than 20 billion annually it also sought what it alleged to be equitable and declaratory relief including disgorgement of profits which arose from defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct in september 2000 the trial court dismissed the government’s mcra and msp claims but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief under the civil provisions of rico 

  

  

the government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2004 the trial court issued an order denying defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy in february 2005 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under the civil provisions of rico and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim in april 2005 the court of appeals denied the government’s motion for rehearing in july 2005 the government petitioned the united states supreme court for further review of the court of appeals’ ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy and in october 2005 the supreme court denied the petition 

  

in june 2005 the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment seeking remedies of approximately 14 billion including 10 billion over a fiveyear period to fund a national smoking cessation program and 4 billion over a tenyear period to fund a public education and countermarketing campaign further the government’s proposed remedy would have required defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 are not achieved according to a prescribed timetable the government’s proposed remedies also included a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business

certain other actions 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the irs concluded its examination of alg’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999 and issued a final revenue agent’s report “rar” on march 15 2006 the rar disallowed benefits pertaining to certain pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 altria group inc has agreed with all conclusions of the rar with the exception of the disallowance of benefits pertaining to several pmcc leveraged lease transactions for the years 1996 through 1999 pmcc will continue to assert its position regarding these leveraged lease transactions and contest approximately 150 million of tax and net interest assessed 

  

and paid with regard to them the irs may in the future challenge and disallow more of pmcc’s leveraged leases based on recent revenue rulings a recent irs notice and subsequent case law addressing specific types of leveraged leases leaseinleaseout “lilo” and saleinleaseout “silo” transactions pmcc believes that the position and supporting case law described in the rar revenue rulings and the irs notice are incorrectly applied to pmcc’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the irs’s position pmcc and alg intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position through litigation in this regard on october 16 2006 pmcc filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york to claim refunds for a portion of these tax payments and associated interest and intends to file complaints for the remainder however should pmcc’s position not be upheld pmcc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and significantly lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases which could have a material effect on the earnings and cash flows of altria group inc in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year pmcc considered this matter in its adoption of fasb interpretation no 48 and fasb staff position no fas 132 

  

  

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation although pm usa has historically been able to obtain required bonds or relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to collect judgments while adverse verdicts have been appealed there remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases this risk has been substantially reduced given that 40 states now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all 

  

alg and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any 

  

it is possible that altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty management believes the litigation environment has substantially improved alg and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has a number of valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however alg and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of alg’s stockholders to do so

during 2003 and 2002 weak economic conditions with resultant consumer frugality and higher state excise taxes resulted in intense price competition in the united states cigarette industry these factors significantly affected shipments of pm usa’s products which compete predominantly in the premium category to address these issues in 2003 pm usa took actions to significantly lower the price gap between its products and its competitors’ products pm usa believes that its enhanced sales and promotion programs are having their intended effect as measured by the improvement in its retail share 

  

pm usa cannot predict future changes or rates of change in domestic tobacco industry volume the relative sizes of the premium and discount segments or its shipment or retail market share however it believes that its results may be materially adversely affected by price increases related to increased excise taxes and tobacco litigation settlements as well as by the other items discussed below and in item 1a risk factors  

  

as discussed in note 19 to altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements “note 19” which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2005 annual report in connection with obtaining a stay of execution in the price case pm usa placed a preexisting 70 6 billion longterm note from alg to pm usa in an escrow account with an illinois financial institution since this note is the result of an intercompany financing arrangement it does not appear on the consolidated balance sheets of altria group inc in addition pm usa agreed to make cash deposits with the clerk of the madison county circuit court in the following amounts beginning october 1 2003 an amount equal to the interest earned by pm usa on the alg note 210 million every six months an additional 800 million in four equal quarterly installments between september 2003 and june 2004 and the payments of the principal of the note which are due in april 2008 2009 and 2010 through december 31 2005 pm usa made 185 billion of the cash payments due under the judge’s order cash payments into the account are included in other assets on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2005 and 2004 if pm usa prevails on appeal the escrowed note and all cash deposited with the court will be returned to pm usa with accrued interest less administrative fees payable to the court 

  

international tobacco products 

  

pmi’s total cigarette shipments increased 57 in 2005 to 8045 billion units pmi estimates that its share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states and dutyfree shipments was approximately 150 145 and 145 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively pmi estimates that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 51 trillion units in 2005 which was in line with 2004 pmi’s leading brands — marlboro  lm  philip morris  bond street  chesterfield  parliament  lark  merit and virginia slims  — collectively accounted for approximately 111 110 and 110 of the international cigarette market in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively shipments of pmi’s principal brand marlboro  increased 20 in 2005 and represented approximately 60 58 and 60 of the international cigarette market in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

pmi has a cigarette market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in more than 80 markets including argentina australia austria belgium colombia the czech republic finland france germany greece hungary indonesia italy japan kazakhstan mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal romania russia saudi arabia serbia singapore spain sweden switzerland turkey and ukraine 

  

  

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

pm usa sells its tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services subsidiaries and affiliates of pmi and their licensees sell their tobacco products worldwide to distributors wholesalers retailers stateowned enterprises and other customers 

  

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality price marketing and packaging constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts including coupons product promotions and allowances for new products the tobacco products of alg’s subsidiaries affiliates and their licensees are advertised and promoted through various media although television and radio advertising of cigarettes is prohibited in the united states and is prohibited or restricted in many other countries in addition as discussed below in item 3 legal proceedings pm usa and other domestic tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

  

in the united states under a contract growing program known as the tobacco farmers partnering program pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers under the terms of this program pm usa agrees to purchase all of the tobacco that participating growers may sell pm usa also purchases its united states tobacco requirements through other sources in 2003 in connection with the settlement of a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quotaholders against certain manufacturers including pm usa and leaf dealers pm usa and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit the agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant including pm usa to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from us tobacco growers over a period of at least ten years these quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement 

  

tobacco production in the united states has been subject to government controls including the production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quotaholders the cost of the buyout to the industry is estimated at approximately 96 billion and will be paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products the cost will be allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products the quota buyout payments will offset already scheduled payments to the national tobacco grower settlement trust the “ntgst” see item 3 legal proceedings health care cost recovery litigation – settlements of health care cost recovery litigation for a discussion of the ntgst manufacturers and importers of tobacco products are also obligated to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government may incur on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program in 2005 pm usa recorded a 138 million expense for its share of the loss altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2006 and beyond 

  

in addition oriental fluecured and burley tobaccos are purchased outside the united states tobacco production outside the united states is subject to a variety of controls and external factors which may include tobacco subsidies and tobacco production control programs all of those controls and programs may substantially affect market prices for tobacco 

  

pm usa and pmi believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

knac’s products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value 

  

stores and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating food products are distributed through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities most distribution in north america is in the form of warehouse delivery but biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two directstore delivery systems kraft supports its selling efforts through three principal sets of activities consumer advertising in broadcast print outdoor and online media consumer promotions such as coupons and contests and trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of products by customers subsidiaries and affiliates of kic sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents 

  

kraft is subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of its business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors may have different profit objectives and some competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates kraft’s food products also compete with generic products and privatelabel products of food retailers wholesalers and cooperatives kraft competes primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand’s market position or to introduce a new product 

  

kraft is a major purchaser of milk cheese nuts green coffee beans cocoa corn products wheat rice pork poultry beef vegetable oil and sugar and other sweeteners it also uses significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard to package its products kraft continuously monitors worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities to enable it to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

  

kraft purchases a substantial portion of its dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government programs as well as by market supply and demand dairy commodity costs on average were lower in 2005 than in 2004 

  

the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply trade agreements among producing and consuming nations the unilateral policies of the producing nations changes in the value of the united states dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products in 2005 coffee bean costs on average were higher than in 2004 

  

a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound sterling and the united states dollar relative to certain other currencies in 2005 cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher than in 2004 

  

during 2005 aggregate commodity costs continued to rise for kraft with significant impacts resulting from higher coffee nuts energy and packaging costs partially offset by lower yearoveryear dairy costs for 2005 pretax aggregate commodity costs increased by approximately 800 million versus 2004 following an increase of approximately 900 million for 2004 versus 2003 kraft expects the higher cost environment to continue particularly for energy and packaging 

  

the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in kraft’s food products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors kraft believes such raw 

  

materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources kraft uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials however kraft does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect kraft from increases in specific raw material costs 

  

regulation 

  

all of knac’s united states food products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the food and drug administration the “fda” or with respect to products containing meat and poultry the food safety and inspection service of the usda among other things these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated foods establish safety standards for food processing establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods establish standards of identity for certain foods determine the safety of food additives and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products 

  

in addition various states regulate the business of knac’s operating units by licensing plants enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

  

many of the food commodities on which knac’s united states businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review 

  

almost all of the activities of kraft’s operations outside of the united states are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to knac’s united states businesses and in some cases international regulatory provisions such as those of the european union the “eu” relating to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

  

the eu and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled accordingly other countries may adopt similar regulations the fda has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current united states law

financial services 

  

pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities total assets of pmcc were 74 billion at december 31 2005 down from 78 billion at december 31 2004 reflecting a decrease in finance assets net due to asset sales in 2003 pmcc shifted its strategic focus and is no longer making new investments but is instead focused on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities accordingly pmcc’s operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold pmcc’s finance asset portfolio includes leases in the following investment categories aircraft electric power surface transport manufacturing real estate and energy industries finance assets net are comprised 

  

of total lease payments receivable and the residual value of assets under lease reduced by thirdparty nonrecourse debt and unearned income the payment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to all other assets of pmcc or altria group inc as required by accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the thirdparty nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rentals receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net in altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets 

  

during 2005 2004 and 2003 pmcc received proceeds from asset sales and maturities of 476 million 644 million and 507 million respectively and recorded gains of 72 million 112 million and 45 million respectively in operating companies income 

  

among its leasing activities pmcc leases a number of aircraft predominantly to major united states passenger carriers at december 31 2005 21 billion of pmcc’s finance asset balance related to aircraft two of pmcc’s aircraft lessees delta air lines inc “delta” and northwest airlines inc “northwest” are currently under bankruptcy protection and a third lessee united air lines inc “united” exited bankruptcy on february 1 2006 in addition pmcc leases various natural gasfired power plants to indirect subsidiaries of calpine corporation “calpine” also currently under bankruptcy protection pmcc is not recording income on any of these leases 

  

pmcc leases 24 boeing 757 aircraft to united with an aggregate finance asset balance of 541 million at december 31 2005 eighteen of these are direct finance leases which united has assumed there is no thirdparty debt associated with these leases united remains current on lease payments due to pmcc on these 18 amended leases pmcc’s leveraged leases for the six remaining aircraft were rejected effective february 1 2006 and it is expected that pmcc’s interest in these aircraft will be foreclosed upon during the first quarter of 2006 pursuant to a foreclosure agreement between pmcc and the public debt holders the foreclosure will result in the writeoff of the 92 million finance asset balance on these six aircraft against pmcc’s allowance for losses and the acceleration of tax payments in the amount of approximately 55 million on these leases 

  

in addition pmcc has an aggregate finance asset balance of 257 million at december 31 2005 relating to six boeing 757 nine boeing 767 and four mcdonnell douglas md88 aircraft leased to delta under leveraged leases in november 2004 pmcc along with other aircraft lessors entered into restructuring agreements with delta on all 19 aircraft as a result of its agreement pmcc recorded a charge to the allowance for losses of 40 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of delta’s bankruptcy filing in september 2005 the restructuring agreement is no longer in effect and pmcc is at risk of having its interest in these aircraft foreclosed upon by the senior lenders under the leveraged leases should a lease rejection or foreclosure occur it would also result in the writeoff of the finance asset balance against pmcc’s allowance for losses and the acceleration of tax payments on these leases and may require a further provision to increase the allowance for losses 

  

pmcc also leases three airbus a320 aircraft and five british aerospace rj85 aircraft to northwest financed under leveraged leases with an aggregate finance asset balance of 62 million at december 31 2005 as a result of northwest’s bankruptcy filing in september 2005 pmcc is at risk of having its interest in these aircraft foreclosed upon by the senior lenders under the leveraged leases should a lease rejection or foreclosure occur it would also result in the writeoff of the finance asset balance against pmcc’s allowance for losses and the acceleration of tax payments on these leases 

  

in addition pmcc’s leveraged leases for ten airbus a319 aircraft with northwest have been rejected in the bankruptcy as a result of the lease rejection pmcc as owner of the aircraft recorded these assets on its consolidated balance sheet at the lower of net book value or fair market value the adjustment to fair market value resulted in a 100 million charge against the allowance for losses in the fourth quarter of 2005 the assets are classified as held for sale and reflected in financial services 

  

other assets on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the assets are either sold or foreclosed upon by the lenders in addition the related nonrecourse debt is reflected in financial services other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the underlying assets are either sold or foreclosed upon by the senior lenders the senior lenders have given notice that these aircraft will be sold at a foreclosure auction on march 16 2006 should a foreclosure occur it would result in the acceleration of tax payments on these aircraft of approximately 57 million 

  

pmcc also leases 16 airbus a319 aircraft to us airways inc “us airways” financed under leveraged leases with an aggregate finance asset balance of 150 million at december 31 2005 in september 2005 us airways emerged from bankruptcy protection and assumed the leases on pmcc’s aircraft without any changes also in september 2005 us airways and america west holdings corp “america west” completed a merger pmcc leases five airbus a320 aircraft and three engines to america west with an aggregate finance asset balance of 44 million at december 31 2005 

  

in addition pmcc leases two 265 megawatt “mw” natural gasfired power plants located in tiverton rhode island and rumford maine to indirect subsidiaries of calpine financed under leveraged leases with an aggregate finance asset balance of 146 million at december 31 2005 on december 20 2005 calpine filed for bankruptcy protection in the initial bankruptcy filing pmcc’s lessees of the tiverton and rumford projects were included on february 6 2006 these leases were rejected as a result of the lease rejections pmcc as owner of the assets will record these assets on its consolidated balance sheet at the lower of net book value or fair market value in the first quarter of 2006 the adjustment to fair market value will result in a 72 million charge against the allowance for losses the assets will be classified as held for sale and reflected in financial services other assets on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the assets are either sold or foreclosed upon by the lenders in addition the related nonrecourse debt will be reflected in financial services other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the underlying assets are either sold or foreclosed upon by the senior lenders should a foreclosure occur it would result in the acceleration of tax payments on the assets of approximately 33 million 

  

pmcc also leases one 750 mw natural gasfired power plant located in pasadena texas to an indirect subsidiary of calpine financed under a leveraged lease with an aggregate finance asset balance of 60 million at december 31 2005 the pasadena lessee did not file for bankruptcy but could file at a future date should a lease rejection or foreclosure occur it would result in the writeoff of the finance asset balance against pmcc’s allowance for losses and the acceleration of tax payments on these leases and may require a further provision to increase the allowance for losses 

  

due to continuing uncertainty within its airline portfolio and bankruptcy filings by delta and northwest pmcc recorded a provision for losses of 200 million in september 2005 as a result of this provision pmcc’s fixed charges coverage ratio did not meet its 1251 requirement under a support agreement with alg accordingly as required by the support agreement a support payment of 150 million was made by alg to pmcc in september 2005 

  

previously pmcc recorded provisions for losses of 140 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 290 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for its airline industry exposure at december 31 2005 pmcc’s allowance for losses which includes the provisions recorded by pmcc for its airline industry exposure was 596 million it is possible that adverse developments in the airline or other industries may require pmcc to increase its allowance for losses

tobaccorelated litigation  there is substantial litigation related to tobacco products in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation range into the billions of dollars there are presently 12 cases on appeal in which verdicts were returned against pm usa including i a 74 billion punitive damages judgment against pm usa in the engle class action which has been overturned by a florida district court of appeal and is currently on appeal to the florida supreme court and ii a compensatory and punitive damages verdict totaling approximately 101 billion in the price case in illinois which was reversed by the illinois supreme court in december 2005 generally in order to prevent a plaintiff from seeking to collect a judgment while the verdict is being appealed the defendant must post an appeal bond or negotiate an alternative arrangement with plaintiffs in the event of future losses at trial we may not always be able to obtain the required bond or to negotiate an acceptable alternative arrangement 

  

the present litigation environment is substantially uncertain and it is possible that our business volume results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation including certain of the verdicts against us that are on appeal we intend to continue vigorously defending all tobaccorelated litigation although we may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in the best interest of our stockholders to do so the entire litigation environment may not improve sufficiently to enable the board of directors to implement any contemplated restructuring alternatives please see note 19 for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

antitobacco action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking and seeking to hold us responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect this decline to continue 

  

excise taxes  cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states and to substantial taxation abroad significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes and fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states the eu and in other foreign jurisdictions in addition in certain jurisdictions pmi’s products are subject to discriminatory tax structures and inconsistent rulings and interpretations on complex methodologies to determine excise and other tax burdens 

  

tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes by our tobacco subsidiaries due to lower consumption levels and to a shift in consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced or lowtaxed tobacco products or to counterfeit or contraband products 

  

increased competition in the domestic tobacco market  settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain domestic and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may take advantage of certain provisions in the legislation that permit the nonsettling manufacturers to concentrate their sales in a limited number of states and thereby avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands 

  

governmental investigations  from time to time alg and its tobacco subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters ongoing investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes and allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain 

  

international markets we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 

  

new tobacco product technologies  our tobacco subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that have the objective of reducing constituents in tobacco smoke identified by public health authorities as harmful while continuing to offer adult smokers products that meet their taste expectations we cannot guarantee that our tobacco subsidiaries will succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors do our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

  

foreign currency  our international food and tobacco subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting their results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

  

competition and economic downturns  each of our consumer products subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and local economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the willingness of consumers to purchase premium cigarette brands and premium food and beverage brands depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label and other economy brands and the volume of our consumer products subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if counterparties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

grocery trade consolidation  as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers grow larger and become more sophisticated they demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs further these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products if kraft fails to use its scale marketing expertise branded products and category leadership positions to respond to these trends its volume growth could slow or it may need to lower prices or increase promotional support of its products any of which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

continued need to add food and beverage products in faster growing and more profitable categories  the food and beverage industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth kraft’s success depends in part on its ability to grow its business faster than populations are growing in the markets that it serves one way to achieve that growth is to enhance its portfolio by adding 

  

products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories if kraft does not succeed in making these enhancements its volume growth may slow which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

strengthening brand portfolios through acquisitions and divestitures  one element of the growth strategy of our consumer product subsidiaries is to strengthen their brand portfolios through active programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures these subsidiaries are constantly investigating potential acquisition candidates and from time to time kraft sells businesses that are outside its core categories or that do not meet its growth or profitability targets acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that all future acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  

food raw material prices  the raw materials used by our food businesses are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging costs which are significantly affected by oil costs and our operating subsidiaries may be unable to increase their prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume net revenues and operating companies income we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not work as planned 

  

food safety quality and health concerns  we could be adversely affected if consumers in kraft’s principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying kraft’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions recent publicity concerning the health implications of obesity and transfatty acids could also reduce consumption of certain of kraft’s products in addition kraft may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or misbranded kraft may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause products to be unavailable for a period of time and a loss of consumer confidence in kraft’s food products and could have a material adverse effect on kraft’s business and results 

  

limited access to commercial paper market  as a result of actions by credit rating agencies during 2003 alg currently has limited access to the commercial paper market and may have to rely on its revolving credit facilities 

  

asset impairment  we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by the market conditions noted above as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the irs is examining the consolidated tax returns for altria group inc which includes pmcc for years 1996 through 1999 recently the irs has proposed to disallow certain transactions and may in the future challenge and disallow several more of pmcc’s leveraged leases based on recent revenue rulings and a recent irs notice addressing specific types of leveraged leases leaseinleaseout transactions qualified technological equipment transactions and saleinleaseout transactions pmcc believes that the position and supporting case law described in the revenue rulings and the irs notice as well as those asserted in the proposed adjustments are incorrectly applied to pmcc’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the irs’s position pmcc and alg intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position through administrative appeals and litigation if necessary and alg believes that given the strength of pmcc’s position it should 

  

ultimately prevail however should pmcc’s position not be upheld pmcc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases

since the dismissal in may 1996 of a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of allegedly addicted smokers plaintiffs have filed numerous putative smoking and health class action suits in various state and federal courts in general these cases purport to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or states although a few cases purport to be nationwide in scope and raise addiction claims and in many cases claims of physical injury as well 

  

class certification has been denied or reversed by courts in 56 smoking and health class actions involving pm usa in arkansas 1 the district of columbia 2 florida 1 illinois 2 iowa 1 kansas 1 louisiana 1 maryland 1 michigan 1 minnesota 1 nevada 29 new jersey 6 new york 2 ohio 1 oklahoma 1 pennsylvania 1 puerto rico 1 south carolina 1 texas 1 and wisconsin 1 a class remains certified in the scott class action discussed above

health care cost recovery litigation 

  

overview 

  

in health care cost recovery litigation domestic and foreign governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  

the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  

defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiffs benefit economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  

although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and six state appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals 

  

a number of foreign governmental entities have filed health care cost recovery actions in the united states such suits have been brought in the united states by 13 countries a canadian province 11 brazilian states and 11 brazilian cities of these 36 cases 34 have been dismissed and the two cases brought by the republic of panama and the brazilian state of sao paulo remain pending in addition to the cases brought in the united states health care cost recovery actions have also been brought in israel 1 the marshall islands 1 dismissed canada 1 france 1 dismissed but on appeal and spain 1 dismissal affirmed on appeal and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions in september 2005 in the case in canada the canadian supreme court ruled that legislation permitting the lawsuit is constitutional and as a result the case which had previously been dismissed by the trial court will now proceed 

  

in march 1999 in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial an ohio jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts in addition a 178 million verdict against defendants including 68 million against pm usa was reversed in a health care cost recovery case in new york and all claims were dismissed with prejudice in february 2005  blue crossblue shield  the health care cost 

  

recovery case brought by the city of st louis missouri and approximately 50 missouri hospitals in which pm usa and alg are defendants remains pending without a trial date 

  

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  

in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the domestic tobacco industry make substantial annual payments in the following amounts excluding future annual payments under the agreement with the tobacco grower states discussed below subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume 2006 through 2007 84 billion each year and thereafter 94 billion each year in addition the domestic tobacco industry is required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million pursuant to the provisions of the msa domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa who are original signatories to the msa “opms” are participating in a proceeding that may result in a downward adjustment to the amounts paid by the opms to the states and territories that are parties to the msa for the year 2003 the availability and the precise amount of that adjustment depend on a number of factors and will likely not be determined until some time in 2006 or later if the adjustment does become available it may be applied as a credit against future payments due from the opms 

  

the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  

as part of the msa the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobaccogrowing states to address concerns about the potential adverse economic impact of the msa on tobacco growers and quota holders to that end in 1999 four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa and the grower states established the national tobacco grower settlement trust “ntgst” a trust fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quota holders the trust was to be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments prior to application of various adjustments scheduled to total 515 billion remaining industry payments 2006 through 2008 500 million each year 2009 and 2010 295 million each year were to be subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation united states cigarette volume and certain contingent events and in general were to be allocated based on each manufacturer’s relative market share provisions of the ntgst allow for offsets to the extent that payments are made to growers and quota holders as part of a legislated end to the federal tobacco quota and price support program 

  

in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout is estimated at approximately 96 billion and will be paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products the cost will be allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products the quota buyout payments will offset already scheduled payments to the ntgst manufacturers and importers of tobacco products are also obligated to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government may incur on the disposition of tobacco pool stock accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program in september 2005 pm usa was billed a total of 138 million for its share of tobacco pool stock losses and recorded the amount as an expense altria group inc does not currently anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2006 and beyond 

  

following the enactment of fetra the trustee of the ntgst and the state entities conveying ntgst payments to tobacco growers and quota holders sued tobacco product manufacturers alleging that the offset provisions did not apply to payments due in 2004 in december 2004 a north carolina trial court ruled that fetra’s enactment had triggered the offset provisions and that the tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa were entitled to receive a refund of amounts paid to the ntgst during the first three quarters of 2004 and were not required to make the payments that would otherwise have been due during the fourth quarter of 2004 plaintiffs appealed and in august 2005 the north carolina supreme court reversed the trial court’s ruling and remanded the case to the lower court for additional proceedings in october 2005 the trial court ordered that the trustee could distribute the amounts that the tobacco companies had already paid to the ntgst during the first three quarters of 2004 pm usa’s portion of these payments was approximately 174 million the trial court also ruled that the manufacturers must make the payment originally scheduled to be made to the ntgst in december 2004 with interest pm usa’s portion of the principal was approximately 58 million which pm usa paid in october 2005 in november 2005 pm usa paid 2 million in interest on the december 2004 payment 

  

the state settlement agreements have materially adversely affected the volumes of pm usa and alg believes that they may also materially adversely affect the results of operations cash flows or financial position of pm usa and altria group inc in future periods the degree of the adverse impact will depend on among other things the rate of decline in united states cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments pm usa’s share of the domestic premium and discount cigarette segments and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the msa and the other state settlement agreements 

  

in april 2004 a lawsuit was filed in state court in los angeles california on behalf of all california residents who purchased cigarettes in california from april 2000 to the present alleging that the msa enabled the defendants including pm usa and alg to engage in unlawful price fixing and market sharing agreements the complaint sought damages and also sought to enjoin defendants from continuing to operate under those provisions of the msa that allegedly violate california law in june 2004 plaintiffs dismissed this case and refiled a substantially similar complaint in federal court in san francisco california the new complaint is brought on behalf of the same purported class but differs in that it covers purchases from june 2000 to the present names the attorney general of california as a defendant and does not name alg as a defendant in march 2005 the trial court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the case plaintiffs have appealed 

  

there is a suit pending against new york state officials in which importers of cigarettes allege that the msa and certain new york statutes enacted in connection with the msa violate federal antitrust law neither alg nor pm usa is a defendant in this case in september 2004 the court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the msa and certain related new york statutes but the court issued a preliminary injunction against an amendment repealing the “allocable share” provision of the new york escrow statute additionally in a suit pending in new york federal court plaintiffs assert that the statutes enacted by new york and the other states in connection with the msa violate the commerce clause of the united states constitution in addition similar lawsuits have been brought in other states on similar antitrust commerce clause andor other constitutional theories including kentucky arkansas kansas louisiana nebraska tennessee and oklahoma and a similar proceeding has been brought under the provisions of the north american free trade agreement in the united nations neither alg nor pm usa is a defendant in these cases 

  

federal government’s lawsuit 

  

in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others including alg 

  

asserting claims under three federal statutes the medical care recovery act “mcra” the medicare secondary payer “msp” provisions of the social security act and the civil provisions of rico trial of the case ended in june 2005 and posttrial briefings were completed in september 2005 the lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobaccorelated illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs including medicare military and veterans’ health benefits programs and the federal employees health benefits program the complaint alleges that such costs total more than 20 billion annually it also seeks what it alleges to be equitable and declaratory relief including disgorgement of profits which arose from defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct in september 2000 the trial court dismissed the government’s mcra and msp claims but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief under the civil provisions of rico 

  

the government alleged that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2004 the trial court issued an order denying defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy in february 2005 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under the civil provisions of rico and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim in april 2005 the court of appeals denied the government’s motion for rehearing in july 2005 the government petitioned the united states supreme court for further review of the court of appeals’ ruling that disgorgement is not an available remedy and in october 2005 the supreme court denied the petition 

  

in june 2005 the government filed with the trial court its proposed final judgment seeking remedies of approximately 14 billion including 10 billion over a fiveyear period to fund a national smoking cessation program and 4 billion over a tenyear period to fund a public education and countermarketing campaign further the government’s proposed remedy would require defendants to pay additional monies to these programs if targeted reductions in the smoking rate of those under 21 are not achieved according to a prescribed timetable the government’s proposed remedies also include a series of measures and restrictions applicable to cigarette business operations – including but not limited to restrictions on advertising and marketing potential measures with respect to certain price promotional activities and research and development disclosure requirements for certain confidential data and implementation of a monitoring system with potential broad powers over cigarette operations 

  

in july 2005 the court granted the motion of six organizations to intervene in the case for the limited purpose of being heard on the issue of permissible and appropriate remedies those organizations argued that because the government’s proposed final judgment sought remedies more limited than what had been sought earlier in the case the government no longer adequately represents the interests of those organizations those organizations have submitted proposals for remedies in addition to those sought by the government in september 2005 the trial court granted six motions filed by various organizations for leave to file amicus curiae briefs two additional motions remain pending including a motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief advocating that as part of any relief granted in the case the court direct more than 14 billion over the next ten years to various purposes specified in their brief

cases under the california business and professions code  in june 1997 and july 1998 two suits  brown and daniels   were filed in california state court alleging that domestic cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others have violated california business and professions code sections 17200 and 17500 regarding unfair unlawful and fraudulent business practices class certification was granted in both cases as to plaintiffs’ claims that class members are entitled to reimbursement of the costs of cigarettes purchased during the class periods and injunctive relief in september 2002 the court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to all claims in one of the cases and plaintiffs appealed in october 2004 the california fourth district court of appeal affirmed the trial court’s ruling and also denied plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing in february 2005 the california supreme court agreed to hear plaintiffs’ appeal in september 2004 the trial court in the other case granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs’ claims attacking defendants’ cigarette advertising and promotion and denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ claims based on allegedly false affirmative statements plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing was denied in march 2005 the court granted defendants’ motion to decertify the class based on a recent change in california law plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the order that decertified the class was denied and plaintiffs have appealed

cigarette contraband cases  in may 2000 and august 2001 various departments of colombia and the european community and 10 member states filed suits in the united states against alg and certain of its subsidiaries including pm usa and pmi and other cigarette manufacturers and their affiliates alleging that defendants sold to distributors cigarettes that would be illegally imported into various jurisdictions the claims asserted in these cases include negligence negligent misrepresentation fraud unjust enrichment violations of rico and its statelaw equivalents and conspiracy plaintiffs in these cases seek actual damages treble damages and unspecified injunctive relief in february 2002 the federal district court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss the actions plaintiffs in each case appealed in january 2004 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the dismissals of the cases based on the common law revenue rule which bars a foreign government from bringing civil claims in us courts for the recovery of lost taxes in april 2004 plaintiffs petitioned the united states supreme court for further review in july 2004 the european community and the 10 member states entered into a cooperation agreement with pmi the terms of 

  

which provide for broad cooperation between pmi and european law enforcement agencies on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts and resolve all disputes between the parties on these issues pursuant to this agreement the european community and the 10 member states withdrew their suit as it relates to the alg pm usa and pmi defendants 

  

in may 2005 the united states supreme court in a summary order granted the plaintiffs’ petitions for review vacated the judgment of the court of appeals for the second circuit and remanded the cases to that court for further review in light of the supreme court’s april 2005 decision in us v pasquantino in pasquantino  a criminal case brought by the united states government the supreme court upheld the convictions of the defendants in that case for violating the us wire fraud statute based on a scheme to smuggle alcohol into canada without paying canadian taxes while expressing no opinion as to the question of whether the revenue rule barred a foreign government from bringing a civil action in us courts for a scheme to defraud it of taxes as the second circuit had earlier held in distinguishing those civil claims from a us criminal prosecution as in pasquantino  in september 2005 the second circuit reinstated its original decision affirming the dismissal of the cases based on the common law revenue rule concluding that the pasquantino decision cast no doubt on the reasoning and result of the original january 2004 decision the second circuit acknowledged that the claims of the european community and 10 member states against alg pm usa and pmi had previously been dismissed in october 2005 the plaintiffs in the two cases petitioned the united states supreme court for further review in january 2006 the supreme court denied plaintiffs’ petition for review it is possible that future litigation related to cigarette contraband issues may be brought 

  

vending machine case  in february 1999 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the united states district court in tennessee as a purported nationwide class of cigarette vending machine operators and alleged that pm usa violated the robinsonpatman act in connection with its promotional and merchandising programs available to retail stores and not available to cigarette vending machine operators the initial complaint was amended to bring the total number of plaintiffs to 211 but by stipulated orders all claims were stayed except those of ten plaintiffs that proceeded to pretrial discovery plaintiffs requested actual damages treble damages injunctive relief attorneys’ fees and costs and other unspecified relief in august 2001 the trial court granted pm usa’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed with prejudice the claims of the ten plaintiffs in october 2001 the court certified its decision for appeal to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit following the stipulation of all plaintiffs that the district court’s dismissal would if affirmed be binding on all plaintiffs in january 2004 the sixth circuit reversed the lower court’s grant of summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs’ claim that pm usa violated robinsonpatman act provisions regarding promotional services and with respect to the discriminatory pricing claim of plaintiffs who bought cigarettes directly from pm usa the claims of eight plaintiffs were tried in july 2005 one plaintiff was granted a continuance and another voluntarily dismissed its claims with prejudice the jury returned a verdict in favor of pm usa on the robinsonpatman act claims and awarded pm usa approximately 110000 on counterclaims pm usa made against three plaintiffs following completion of the trial the district court lifted the stay on the remaining claims and directed the magistrate judge to establish a schedule for the disposition of those claims in october 2005 on agreement of the parties all claims in this matter were dismissed with prejudice 

  

asbestos contribution cases  these cases which have been brought on behalf of former asbestos manufacturers and affiliated entities against pm usa and other cigarette manufacturers seek among other things contribution or reimbursement for amounts expended in connection with the defense and payment of asbestos claims that were allegedly caused in whole or in part by cigarette smoking currently one case is pending in california 

  

certain other actions 

  

italian antitrust case  during 2001 the competition authority in italy initiated an investigation into the pricing activities of participants in that cigarette market in march 2003 the authority issued its findings and imposed fines totaling 50 million euro on certain affiliates of pmi pmi’s affiliates appealed to the administrative court which rejected the appeal in july 2003 pmi believes that its affiliates have numerous grounds for appeal and in february 2004 its affiliates appealed to the supreme administrative court the appeal was heard on november 8 2005 however under italian law if fines are not paid within certain specified time periods interest and eventually penalties will be applied to the fines accordingly in december 2003 pending final resolution of the case pmi’s affiliates paid 51 million euro representing the fines and any applicable interest to the date of payment the 51 million euro will be returned to pmi’s affiliates if they prevail on appeal accordingly the payment has been included in other assets on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets 

  

irs challenges to pmcc leases  the irs is examining the consolidated tax returns for altria group inc which includes pmcc for years 1996 through 1999 recently the irs has proposed to disallow certain transactions and may in the future challenge and disallow several more of pmcc’s leveraged leases based on recent revenue rulings and a recent irs notice addressing specific types of leveraged leases leaseinleaseout transactions qualified technological equipment transactions and saleinleaseout transactions pmcc believes that the position and supporting case law described in the revenue rulings and the irs notice as well as those asserted in the proposed adjustments are incorrectly applied to pmcc’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the irs’s position pmcc and alg intend to vigorously defend against any challenges based on that position through administrative appeals and litigation if necessary and alg believes that given the strength of pmcc’s position it should ultimately prevail however should pmcc’s position not be upheld pmcc may have to accelerate the payment of significant amounts of federal income tax and lower its earnings to reflect the recalculation of the income from the affected leveraged leases 

  

  

it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against alg and its subsidiaries litigation is subject to many uncertainties as discussed above under “recent trial results” unfavorable verdicts awarding substantial damages against pm usa have been returned in 16 cases since 1999 of the 16 cases in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs four have reached final resolution a verdict against defendants in a health care cost recovery case has been reversed and all claims were dismissed with prejudice and after exhausting all appeals pm usa paid 33 million including interest of 285000 in an individual smoking and health case in florida 17 million including interest of 64 million in an individual smoking and health case in california and 328759 including interest of 78259 in a flight attendant ets case in florida the remaining 12 cases are in various posttrial stages it is possible that there could be further adverse developments in these cases and that additional cases could be decided unfavorably in the event of an adverse trial result in certain pending litigation the defendant may not be able to obtain a required bond or obtain relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent a plaintiff from seeking to collect a judgment while an adverse verdict is being appealed an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation there have also been a number of adverse legislative regulatory political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry that have received widespread media attention these developments may negatively affect the perception of judges and jurors with respect to the tobacco industry possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation 

  

alg and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can 

  

be reasonably estimated except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings  i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated litigation ii management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobaccorelated litigation and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any 

  

the present legislative and litigation environment is substantially uncertain and it is possible that the business and volume of alg’s subsidiaries as well as altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation or by the enactment of federal or state tobacco legislation alg and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has a number of valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however alg and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of alg’s stockholders to do so

domestic tobacco products 

  pm usa is the largest tobacco company in the united states with total cigarette shipments in the united states of 1871 billion units in 2004 a decrease of 01 from 2003 

  pm usa’s major premium brands are marlboro  virginia slims and parliament its principal discount brand is basic all of its brands are marketed to take into account differing preferences of adult smokers marlboro is the largestselling cigarette brand in the united states with shipments of 1504 billion units in 2004 up 17 over 2003

4   the following table summarizes pm usa’s retail share performance based on data from the iri capstone total retail panel which was developed to measure market share in retail stores selling cigarettes but was not designed to capture internet or direct mail sales 

   pm usa cannot predict future changes or rates of change in domestic tobacco industry volume the relative sizes of the premium and discount segments or in pm usa’s shipments or retail market share however it believes that pm usa’s results may be materially adversely affected by price increases related to increased excise taxes and tobacco litigation settlements as well as by the other items discussed below and in the section captioned “cautionary factors that may affect future results” 

  as discussed in note 19 to altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements “note 19” which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2004 annual report in connection with obtaining a stay of execution in the price case pm usa placed a preexisting 70 6 billion longterm note from alg to pm usa into an escrow account with an illinois financial institution since this note is the result of an intercompany financing arrangement it does not appear on the consolidated balance sheet of altria group inc in addition pm usa agreed to make cash deposits with the clerk of the madison county circuit court in the following amounts beginning october 1 2003 an amount equal to the interest earned by pm usa on the alg note 210 million every six months an additional 800 million in four equal quarterly installments between september 2003 and june 2004 and the payments of the principal of the note which are due in equal installments in april 2008 2009 and 2010 through december 31 2004 pm usa made 14 billion of the cash deposits due under the judge’s order cash deposits into the account are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet if pm usa prevails on appeal the escrowed note and all cash deposited with the court will be returned to pm usa with accrued interest less administrative fees payable to the court 

international tobacco products 

  pmi’s total cigarette shipments increased 35 in 2004 to 7614 billion units pmi estimates that its share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states and dutyfree shipments was approximately 145 in 2004 and 2003 pmi estimates that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 51 trillion units in 2004 a 15 increase over 2003 pmi’s leading brands — marlboro  lm  philip morris  bond street  chesterfield  parliament  lark  merit and virginia slims  — collectively accounted for approximately 110 of the international cigarette market in 2004 and 2003 shipments of pmi’s principal brand marlboro  decreased 13 in 2004 and represented approximately 58 and 60 respectively of the international cigarette market in 2004 and 2003 

  pmi has a cigarette market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in more than 70 markets including argentina australia austria belgium the czech republic finland france germany greece hong kong hungary italy japan kazakhstan mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal romania russia saudi arabia serbia singapore spain sweden switzerland turkey and ukraine 

5   in 2004 pmi continued to invest in and expand its international manufacturing base including significant investments in facilities located in germany the philippines poland russia serbia turkey and ukraine 

   pm usa sells its tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services subsidiaries and affiliates of pmi and their licensees sell their tobacco products worldwide to distributors wholesalers retailers stateowned enterprises and other customers 

  the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality price marketing and packaging constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts the tobacco products of alg’s subsidiaries affiliates and their licensees are advertised and promoted through various media although television and radio advertising of cigarettes is prohibited in the united states and is prohibited or restricted in many other countries in addition as discussed below in item 3 legal proceedings pm usa and other domestic tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

  during 2003 and 2002 weak economic conditions with resultant consumer frugality and higher state excise taxes resulted in intense price competition in the united states cigarette industry these factors significantly affected shipments of pm usa’s products which compete predominantly in the premium category to address these issues in 2003 pm usa took actions to significantly lower the price gap between its products and its competitors’ products pm usa believes that its enhanced sales and promotion programs are having their intended effect as measured by the improvement in its retail share 

  in the united states under a contract growing program known as the tobacco farmers partnering program pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers under the terms of this program pm usa agrees to purchase all of the tobacco that participating growers may sell without penalty under the federal tobacco program pm usa also purchases its united states tobacco requirements through other sources in 2003 in connection with the settlement of a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quotaholders against certain manufacturers including pm usa and leaf dealers pm usa and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit the agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant including pm usa to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from us tobacco growers over a period of at least ten years these quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement 

  tobacco production in the united states is subject to government controls including the tobaccoprice support and production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quotaholders the cost of the buyout is approximately 96 billion and will be paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products the cost will be allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products pm usa expects that its quota buyout payments will offset already scheduled payments to the national tobacco grower settlement trust the “ntgst” see item 3 legal proceedings health care cost recovery litigation — settlements of health care cost recovery litigation for a discussion of the ntgst manufacturers and importers of tobacco products are also obligated to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government may incur on the disposition of pool stock tobacco accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program pm usa’s share of tobacco pool stock losses cannot currently be determined as the calculation of any such losses will depend on a number of factors including the extent to which the government can sell such pool tobacco and thereby mitigate or avoid losses altria group inc does not 

6 anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2005 and beyond 

  in addition oriental fluecured and burley tobaccos are purchased outside the united states tobacco production outside the united states is subject to a variety of controls and external factors which may include tobacco subsidies and tobacco production control programs all of those controls and programs may substantially affect market prices for tobacco 

  pm usa and pmi believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements

 distribution competition and raw materials 

  knac’s products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating food products are distributed through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities most distribution in north america is in the form of warehouse delivery but biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two directstore delivery systems kraft supports its selling efforts through three principal sets of activities consumer advertising in broadcast print and outdoor media consumer promotions such as coupons and contests and trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of products by customers subsidiaries and affiliates of kic sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents 

  kraft is subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of its business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors may have different profit objectives and some competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates in addition certain international competitors benefit from government subsidies kraft’s food products also compete with generic products and privatelabel products of food retailers wholesalers and cooperatives kraft competes primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand’s market position or to introduce a new product 

  kraft is a major purchaser of milk cheese nuts green coffee beans cocoa corn products wheat rice pork poultry beef vegetable oil and sugar and other sweeteners it also uses significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard to package its products kraft continuously monitors worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities to enable it to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

  kraft purchases a substantial portion of its dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and individual processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government programs as well as by market supply and demand dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2004 than in 2003 dairy costs rose to historical highs during the first half of 2004 but moderated during the second half of 2004 

  the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply trade agreements among producing and consuming nations the unilateral policies of the producing nations changes in the value of the united states dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products coffee bean costs on average during 2004 were higher than in 2003 

  a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound sterling and the united states dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean costs on average during 2004 were lower than in 2003 

  the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in kraft’s food products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors kraft believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources kraft uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials however kraft does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect kraft from increases in specific raw material costs 

9   for 2004 kraft had a negative pretax earnings impact from all commodities of approximately 930 million as compared with 2003 

regulation 

  all of knac’s united states food products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the food and drug administration the “fda” or with respect to products containing meat and poultry the usda among other things these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated foods establish safety standards for food processing establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods establish standards of identity for certain foods determine the safety of food additives and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products 

  in addition various states regulate the business of knac’s operating units by licensing dairy plants enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

  many of the food commodities on which knac’s united states businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review 

  almost all of the activities of kraft’s operations outside of the united states are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to knac’s united states businesses and in some cases international regulatory provisions such as those of the european union the “eu” relating to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

  the eu and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled accordingly other countries may adopt similar regulations the fda has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current united states law

other matters 

customers

trademarks 

  trademarks are of material importance to alg’s consumer products subsidiaries and are protected by registration or otherwise in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold 

environmental regulation 

  alg and its subsidiaries are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party in 2004 subsidiaries or former subsidiaries of alg were involved in approximately 94 active matters subjecting them to potential remediation costs under superfund or otherwise alg’s subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations although it is not possible to predict precise levels of environmentalrelated expenditures compliance with such laws and regulations including the payment of any remediation costs and the making of such expenditures has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations capital expenditures financial position earnings or competitive position 

cautionary factors that may affect future results 

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

  we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly 

   this section uses the terms “we” “our” and “us” when it is not necessary to distinguish among alg and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context 

12 in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our subsidiaries’ businesses you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time 

  tobaccorelated litigation  there is substantial litigation related to tobacco products in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation range into the billions of dollars there are presently 13 cases on appeal in which verdicts were returned against pm usa including a compensatory and punitive damages verdict totaling approximately 101 billion in the price case in illinois generally in order to prevent a plaintiff from seeking to collect a judgment while the verdict is being appealed the defendant must post an appeal bond frequently in the amount of the judgment or more or negotiate an alternative arrangement with plaintiffs in the event of future losses at trial we may not always be able to obtain the required bond or to negotiate an acceptable alternative arrangement 

  the present litigation environment is substantially uncertain and it is possible that our business volume results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation including certain of the verdicts against us that are on appeal we intend to continue vigorously defending all tobaccorelated litigation although we may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in the best interest of our stockholders to do so the entire litigation environment may not improve sufficiently to enable the board of directors to implement any contemplated restructuring alternatives please see note 19 for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

  antitobacco action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking and seeking to hold us responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect this decline to continue 

  excise taxes  cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states and to substantial taxation abroad significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states the eu and in other foreign jurisdictions in addition in certain jurisdictions pmi’s products are subject to discriminatory tax structures and inconsistent rulings and interpretations on complex methodologies to determine excise and other tax burdens 

  these tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes by our tobacco subsidiaries due to lower consumption levels and to a shift in consumer purchases from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to other lowpriced tobacco products or to counterfeit or contraband products 

  increased competition in the domestic tobacco market  settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces increased competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain domestic and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may take advantage of certain provisions in the legislation that permit the nonsettling manufacturers to concentrate their sales in a limited number of states and thereby avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands 

  governmental investigations  from time to time alg and its tobacco subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters ongoing investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain international markets and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is 

13 possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 

  new tobacco product technologies  our tobacco subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that have the objective of reducing the risk of smoking their goal is to reduce constituents in tobacco smoke identified by public health authorities as harmful while continuing to offer adult smokers products that meet their taste expectations we cannot guarantee that our tobacco subsidiaries will succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors do our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

  foreign currency  our international food and tobacco subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting their results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

  competition and economic downturns  each of our consumer products subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and local economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

   the willingness of consumers to purchase premium cigarette brands and premium food and beverage brands depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label and other economy brands and the volume of our consumer products subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if counterparties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our profitability 

  grocery trade consolidation  as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers grow larger and become more sophisticated they demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs further these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products if kraft fails to use its scale marketing expertise branded products and category leadership positions to respond to these trends its volume growth could slow or it may need to lower prices or increase promotional support of its products any of which would adversely affect our profitability 

  continued need to add food and beverage products in faster growing and more profitable categories  the food and beverage industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth kraft’s success depends in part on its ability to grow its business faster than populations are growing in the markets that it serves one way to achieve that growth is to enhance its portfolio by adding products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories if kraft does not succeed in making these enhancements its volume growth may slow which would adversely affect our profitability 

  strengthening brand portfolios through acquisitions and divestitures  one element of the growth strategy of our consumer product subsidiaries is to strengthen their brand portfolios through active programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures these subsidiaries are constantly investigating potential acquisition 

14 candidates and from time to time kraft sells businesses that are outside its core categories or that do not meet its growth or profitability targets acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that all future acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  food raw material prices  the raw materials used by our food businesses are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging costs and our operating subsidiaries may be unable to increase their prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume net revenue and operating companies income we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not work as planned 

  food safety quality and health concerns  we could be adversely affected if consumers in kraft’s principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying kraft’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions recent publicity concerning the health implications of obesity and transfatty acids could also reduce consumption of certain of kraft’s products in addition kraft may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or misbranded kraft may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause products to be unavailable for a period of time and a loss of consumer confidence in kraft’s food products and could have a material adverse effect on kraft’s business and results 

  limited access to commercial paper market  as a result of actions by credit rating agencies during 2003 alg currently has limited access to the commercial paper market and may have to rely on its revolving credit facility 

  asset impairment  we periodically calculate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets to test for impairment this calculation may be affected by the market conditions noted above as well as interest rates and general economic conditions if an impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which will reduce our earnings

smoking and health litigation 

overview 

  plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in smoking and health cases are based on various theories of recovery including negligence gross negligence strict liability fraud misrepresentation design defect failure to warn breach of express and implied warranties breach of special duty conspiracy concert of action violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes and claims under the federal and state antiracketeering statutes in certain of these cases plaintiffs claim that cigarette smoking exacerbated the injuries caused by their exposure to asbestos plaintiffs in the smoking and health actions seek various forms of relief including compensatory and punitive damages treblemultiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds disgorgement of profits and injunctive and equitable relief defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause assumption of the risk comparative fault andor contributory negligence statutes of limitations and preemption by the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act

health care cost recovery litigation 

overview 

  in health care cost recovery litigation domestic and foreign governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiff benefits economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and six state appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals 

  a number of foreign governmental entities have filed health care cost recovery actions in the united states such suits have been brought in the united states by 13 countries a canadian province 11 brazilian states and 11 brazilian cities thirtythree of the cases have been dismissed and three remain pending in addition to the cases brought in the united states health care cost recovery actions have also been brought in israel the marshall islands dismissed canada france and spain and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions in september 2003 the case pending in france was dismissed and plaintiff has appealed in may 2004 the case in spain was dismissed and plaintiff has appealed 

  in march 1999 in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial an ohio jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts in june 2001 a new york jury returned a verdict awarding 683 million in 

23 compensatory damages against pm usa and a total of 11 million against four other defendants in a health care cost recovery action brought by a blue cross and blue shield plan and defendants including pm usa appealed in december 2004 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the damages award and an accompanying award of attorneys’ fees reversed the judgment and remanded the case with instructions to the trial court to dismiss plaintiff’s claims in february 2005 the trial court dismissed all of plaintiff’s claims with prejudice trial in the health care cost recovery case brought by the city of st louis missouri and approximately 50 missouri hospitals in which pm usa and alg are defendants is scheduled for january 2006 

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the domestic tobacco industry make substantial annual payments in the following amounts excluding future annual payments contemplated by the agreement with tobacco growers discussed below subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume 2005 through 2007 84 billion each year and thereafter 94 billion each year in addition the domestic tobacco industry is required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million 

  the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  as part of the msa the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobaccogrowing states to address concerns about the potential adverse economic impact of the msa on tobacco growers and quotaholders to that end in 1999 four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa and the grower states established the ntgst a trust fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quotaholders the trust was to be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments prior to application of various adjustments scheduled to total 515 billion remaining industry payments 2005 through 2008 500 million each year 2009 and 2010 295 million each year are subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation united states cigarette volume and certain contingent events and in general are to be allocated based on each manufacturer’s relative market share provisions of the ntgst allow for offsets to the extent that payments are made to growers as part of a legislated end to the federal tobacco quota and price support program 

  in october 2004 the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 “fetra” was signed into law fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industryfunded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders the cost of the buyout is approximately 96 billion and will be paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products the cost will be allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of all tobacco products pm usa expects that its quota buyout payments will offset already scheduled payments to the ntgst manufacturers and importers of tobacco products are also obligated to cover any losses up to 500 million that the government may incur on the disposition of pool stock tobacco accumulated under the previous tobacco price support program pm usa’s share of tobacco pool stock losses cannot currently be determined as the calculation of any such losses will depend on a number of factors including the extent to which the government can sell such pool tobacco and thereby mitigate or avoid losses altria group inc does not anticipate that the quota buyout will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2005 and beyond 

  following the enactment of fetra the trustee of the ntgst and the state entities conveying ntgst payments to tobacco growers and quota holders sued tobacco product manufacturers alleging that the offset 

24 provisions do not apply to payments due in 2004 in december 2004 a north carolina court ruled that the tobacco companies including pm usa are entitled to receive a refund of amounts paid to the ntgst during the first three quarters of 2004 and are not required to make the payments that would otherwise have been due during the fourth quarter of 2004 plaintiffs have appealed if the trial court’s ruling is upheld pm usa would reverse accruals and receive reimbursements totaling 232 million 

  the state settlement agreements have materially adversely affected the volumes of pm usa and alg believes that they may also materially adversely affect the results of operations cash flows or financial position of pm usa and altria group inc in future periods the degree of the adverse impact will depend on among other things the rate of decline in united states cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments pm usa’s share of the domestic premium and discount cigarette segments and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the msa and the other state settlement agreements 

  in april 2004 a lawsuit was filed in state court in los angeles california on behalf of all california residents who purchased cigarettes in california from april 2000 to the present alleging that the msa enabled the defendants including pm usa and alg to engage in unlawful price fixing and market sharing agreements the complaint sought damages and also sought to enjoin defendants from continuing to operate under those provisions of the msa that allegedly violate california law in june plaintiffs dismissed this case and refiled a substantially similar complaint in federal court in san francisco california the new complaint is brought on behalf of the same purported class but differs in that it covers purchases from june 2000 to the present names the attorney general of california as a defendant and does not name alg as a defendant pm usa’s motion to dismiss the case is pending 

  there is a suit pending against new york state officials in which importers of cigarettes allege that the msa and certain new york statutes enacted in connection with the msa violate federal antitrust law neither alg nor pm usa is a defendant in this case in september 2004 the court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the msa and certain related new york statutes but the court issued a preliminary injunction against an amendment repealing the “allocable share” provision of the new york escrow statute plaintiffs have appealed the trial court’s september 2004 order to the extent that it denied their request for a preliminary injunction in addition a similar putative class action has been brought in the commonwealth of kentucky challenging the repeal of certain implementing legislation that had been enacted in kentucky subsequent to the msa neither alg nor pm usa is a defendant in the case in kentucky 

federal government’s lawsuit 

  in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers including pm usa and others including alg asserting claims under three federal statutes the medical care recovery act “mcra” the medicare secondary payer “msp” provisions of the social security act and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act “rico” trial of the case is currently underway the lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobaccorelated illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs including medicare military and veterans’ health benefits programs and the federal employees health benefits program the complaint alleges that such costs total more than 20 billion annually it also seeks what it alleges to be equitable and declaratory relief including disgorgement of profits which arose from defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct in september 2000 the trial court dismissed the government’s mcra and msp claims but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief under rico the government alleges that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2004 the trial court issued an order denying defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment limiting the disgorgement remedy in february 2005 a panel of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that disgorgement is not a remedy available to the government under rico and entered summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to the disgorgement claim the government’s motion for rehearing is pending in july 2004 the trial court found that 

25 pm usa had inadequately complied with a document preservation order and ordered that persons who failed to comply with pm usa’s document retention program will not be permitted to testify at trial and pm usa and alg jointly pay 2750000 to the court by september 1 2004 this amount was paid to the court in september 2004 pm usa and alg have sought rehearing of the judge’s ruling

certain other actions 

  italian tax matters  in recent years approximately two hundred tax assessments alleging nonpayment of taxes in italy were served upon certain affiliates of pmi all of these assessments were resolved in 2003 and the second quarter of 2004 with the exception of certain assessments which were duplicative of other assessments legal proceedings continue in order to resolve these duplicative assessments 

  italian antitrust case  during 2001 the competition authority in italy initiated an investigation into the pricing activities by participants in that cigarette market in march 2003 the authority issued its findings and imposed fines totaling 50 million euro on certain affiliates of pmi pmi’s affiliates appealed to the administrative court which rejected the appeal in july 2003 pmi believes that its affiliates have numerous grounds for appeal and in february 2004 its affiliates appealed to the supreme administrative court however under italian law if fines are not paid within certain specified time periods interest and eventually penalties will be applied to the fines accordingly in december 2003 pending final resolution of the case pmi’s affiliates paid 51 million euro representing the fines and any applicable interest to the date of payment the 

28 51 million euro will be returned to pmi’s affiliates if they prevail on appeal accordingly the payment has been included in other assets on altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets 

  pmcc federal income tax matter  the irs is examining the consolidated tax returns for altria group inc which include pmcc for years 1996 through 1999 recently the irs has challenged some and in the future may challenge several more of pmcc’s leveraged leases based on recent revenue rulings and a recent irs notice addressing specific types of leveraged leases lease inlease out transactions qualified technological equipment transactions and sale inlease out transactions pmcc believes that the position and supporting case law described in the revenue rulings and the irs notice are incorrectly applied to pmcc’s transactions and that its leveraged leases are factually and legally distinguishable in material respects from the irs’s position pmcc and its parent alg intend vigorously to defend against any challenges based on that position through administrative appeals and litigation if necessary and alg believes that the ultimate outcome of such challenges will not have a material adverse impact on altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position 

 

  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against alg and its subsidiaries litigation is subject to many uncertainties as discussed above under “recent trial results” unfavorable verdicts awarding substantial damages against pm usa have been returned in 15 cases since 1999 of the fifteen cases in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs two have reached final resolution a verdict against defendants in a health care cost recovery case has been reversed and all claims were dismissed with prejudice and after exhausting all appeals pm usa paid 37 million in an individual smoking and health case in florida the remaining 13 cases are in various posttrial stages it is possible that there could be further adverse developments in these cases and that additional cases could be decided unfavorably in the event of an adverse trial result in certain pending litigation the defendant may not be able to obtain a required bond or obtain relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent a plaintiff from seeking to collect a judgment while an adverse verdict is being appealed an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation there have also been a number of adverse legislative regulatory political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry that have received widespread media attention these developments may negatively affect the perception of judges and jurors with respect to the tobacco industry possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation 

  alg and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated litigation ii management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobaccorelated litigation and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any 

  the present legislative and litigation environment is substantially uncertain and it is possible that the business and volume of alg’s subsidiaries as well as altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation or by the enactment of federal or state tobacco legislation alg and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has a number of valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however alg and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of alg’s stockholders to do so

a general development of business 

  

general 

  

altria group inc “alg” through its whollyowned subsidiaries philip morris usa inc “pm usa” philip morris international inc “pmi” and its majorityowned 846 subsidiary kraft foods inc “kraft” is engaged in the manufacture and sale of various consumer products including cigarettes and foods and beverages philip morris capital corporation “pmcc” another whollyowned subsidiary is primarily engaged in leasing activities during 2003 pmcc shifted its strategic focus from an emphasis on the growth of its portfolio of finance leases through new investments to one of maximizing investment gains and generating cash flows from its existing portfolio of leased assets alg’s former whollyowned subsidiary miller brewing company “miller” was engaged in the manufacture and sale of various beer products prior to the merger of miller into south african breweries plc “sab” on july 9 2002 as used herein unless the context indicates otherwise altria group inc refers to the consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows of the altria family of companies alg’s family of companies forms the largest consumer packaged goods business in the world  

  

pm usa is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes pm usa is the largest cigarette company in the united states pmi is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged primarily in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products mainly cigarettes internationally marlboro the principal cigarette brand of these companies has been the world’s largestselling cigarette brand since 1972 

  

kraft is engaged in the manufacture and sale of branded foods and beverages in the united states canada europe the middle east and africa latin america and asia pacific kraft conducts its global business through its subsidiaries kraft foods north america inc “kfna” and kraft foods international inc “kfi” kraft has operations in 68 countries and sells its products in more than 150 countries 

  

in january 2004 kraft announced a multiyear restructuring program with the objectives of leveraging kraft’s global scale realigning and lowering its cost structure and optimizing capacity utilization as part of this program kraft anticipates the closing or sale of up to twenty plants and the elimination of approximately 6000 positions over the next three years kraft expects to incur up to 12 billion in pretax charges reflecting asset disposals severance and other implementation costs including an estimated range of 750 million to 800 million in 2004 approximately onehalf of the pretax charges are expected to require cash payments in addition kraft expects to spend approximately 140 million in capital over the next three years to implement the program including approximately 50 million in 2004 annual cost savings as a result of this program are expected to approximate 120 million to 140 million in 2004 and are anticipated to reach approximately 400 million by 2006 all of which are expected to be used in supporting brandbuilding initiatives 

  

on june 13 2001 kraft completed an initial public offering “ipo” of 280000000 shares of its class a common stock at a price of 3100 per share at december 31 2003 alg owned approximately 846 of the outstanding shares of kraft’s capital stock through its ownership of 510 of kraft’s class a common stock and 100 of kraft’s class b common stock kraft’s class a common stock has one vote per share while kraft’s class b common stock has ten votes per share therefore at december 31 2003 alg held approximately 98 of the combined voting power of kraft’s outstanding capital stock 

  

   

on july 9 2002 miller merged into sab and sab changed its name to sabmiller plc “sabmiller” at closing alg received 430 million shares of sabmiller valued at approximately 34 billion based upon a share price of 512 british pounds per share in exchange for miller which had 20 billion of existing debt the shares in sabmiller owned by alg resulted in a 36 economic interest in sabmiller and a 249 voting interest the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of 26 billion or 17 billion aftertax which was recorded in the third quarter of 2002 

  

source of funds—dividends 

  

because alg is a holding company its principal sources of funds are from the payment of dividends and repayment of debt from its subsidiaries except for minimum net worth requirements alg’s principal whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

  

b financial information about industry segments 

  

altria group inc’s reportable segments are domestic tobacco international tobacco north american food international food beer prior to july 9 2002 and financial services net revenues and operating companies income  together with a reconciliation to operating income attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years along with total assets for each of tobacco food beer and financial services at december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 are set forth in note 14 to altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements “note 14” which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2003 annual report 

  

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

  

   

the decrease in the relative percentage attributable to domestic tobacco reflects the effects of price promotions to narrow price gaps in the intensely competitive united states cigarette industry and lower volume the decrease in the relative percentage attributable to beer is the result of the merger of miller into sabmiller in 2002 the increase in the relative percentage attributable to financial services from 2002 to 2003 reflects a 290 million provision for leveraged lease exposure to the united states airline industry in 2002 partially offset by the shift in focus from an emphasis on the growth of pmcc’s portfolio of finance leases through new investments to one of maximizing investment gains and generating cash flows from its existing portfolio of leased assets in 2003 

  

   

c narrative description of business 

  

tobacco products 

  

pm usa manufactures markets and sells cigarettes in the united states and its territories and contract manufactures cigarettes for pmi subsidiaries and affiliates of pmi and their licensees manufacture market and sell tobacco products outside the united states 

  

acquisitions 

  

during 2003 pmi purchased approximately 742 of a tobacco business in serbia for a cost of approximately 486 million and purchased 99 of a tobacco business in greece for approximately 387 million pmi also increased its ownership interest in its affiliate in ecuador from less than 50 to approximately 98 for a cost of 70 million during 2002 pmi acquired a sales promotion company in japan for 25 million during 2001 pmi increased its ownership interest in its affiliate in argentina the cost of this and other smaller acquisitions in 2001 was 257 million 

  

domestic tobacco products 

  

pm usa is the largest tobacco company in the united states with total cigarette shipments in the united states of 1872 billion units in 2003 a decrease of 23 from 2002 while pm usa’s shipment volume comparisons to 2002 continued to be affected by factors such as a weak economic environment the decline in overall cigarette consumption and sharp increases in state excise taxes pm usa’s retail share improved sequentially through 2003 

  

pm usa’s major premium brands are marlboro virginia slims and parliament its principal discount brand is basic  all of its brands are marketed to take into account differing preferences of adult smokers marlboro is the largestselling cigarette brand in the united states with shipments of 1479 billion units in 2003 down 04 from 2002 

  

in the premium segment pm usa’s 2003 shipment volume decreased 11 from 2002 and its shipment volume in the discount segment decreased 129 shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 913 of pm usa’s total 2003 volume up from 902 in 2002 

  

effective with the first quarter of 2003 pm usa began reporting retail share results based on a retail tracking service with data beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002 this service iricapstone total retail panel was developed to provide a more comprehensive measure of market share in retail stores selling cigarettes it is not designed to capture internet or direct mail sales the following table summarizes sequential retail share performance for pm usa’s key brands from the fourth quarter of 2002 through the fourth quarter of 2003 and the full year 2003 based on data from the iricapstone total retail panel 

  

   

pm usa cannot predict future changes or rates of change in domestic tobacco industry volume the relative sizes of the premium and discount segments or in pm usa’s shipments or retail share however it believes that pm usa’s results may be materially adversely affected by price increases related to increased excise taxes and tobacco litigation settlements as well as by the other tobacco legislation discussed below 

  

as discussed in note 18 to altria group inc’s consolidated financial statements “note 18” which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2003 annual report in connection with obtaining a stay of execution in the price case pm usa placed a preexisting 70 6 billion longterm note from alg to pm usa into an escrow account with an illinois financial institution since this note is the result of an intercompany financing arrangement it does not appear on the consolidated balance sheet of altria group inc in addition pm usa agreed to make cash deposits with the clerk of the madison county circuit court in the following amounts beginning october 1 2003 an amount equal to the interest earned by pm usa on the alg note 210 million every six months an additional 800 million in four equal quarterly installments between september 2003 and june 2004 and the payments of the principal of the note which are due in april 2008 2009 and 2010 through december 31 2003 pm usa made 610 million of the cash deposits due under the judge’s order cash deposits into the account are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet if pm usa prevails on appeal the escrowed note and all cash deposited with the court will be returned to pm usa with accrued interest less administrative fees payable to the court 

  

international tobacco products 

  

pmi’s total cigarette shipments increased 18 in 2003 to 7358 billion units pmi estimates that its share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states and dutyfree shipments was approximately 145 in 2003 up from 142 in 2002 pmi estimates that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 49 trillion units in 2003 a slight decrease from 2002 pmi’s leading brands— marlboro lm philip morris bond street chesterfield parliament lark merit and virginia slims —collectively accounted for approximately 114 of the international cigarette market up from 111 in 2002 shipments of pmi’s principal brand marlboro decreased 19 in 2003 and represented more than 6 of the international cigarette market in 2003 and 2002 

  

pmi has a cigarette market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in more than 60 markets including argentina austria belgium brazil the czech republic finland france germany greece hong kong israel italy japan malaysia mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal romania russia saudi arabia singapore spain switzerland turkey and the ukraine 

  

in 2003 pmi continued to invest in and expand its international manufacturing base including significant investments in facilities located in germany korea malaysia the philippines poland portugal and russia 

  

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

pm usa sells its tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services subsidiaries and affiliates of pmi and their licensees sell their tobacco products worldwide to distributors wholesalers retailers stateowned enterprises and other customers 

  

the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality price marketing and packaging constituting the significant methods of 

  

competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price promotions and other discounts the tobacco products of alg’s subsidiaries affiliates and their licensees are advertised and promoted through various media although television and radio advertising of cigarettes is prohibited in the united states and is prohibited or restricted in many other countries in addition as discussed below in item 3 legal proceedings pm usa and other domestic tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

  

during 2003 and 2002 weak economic conditions with resultant consumer frugality and higher state excise taxes have resulted in intense price competition in the united states cigarette industry these factors have significantly affected shipments of pm usa’s products which compete predominantly in the premium category to address these issues pm usa took actions to significantly lower the price gap between its products and its competitors’ products in 2003 pm usa believes that its enhanced sales and promotion programs are having their intended effect as measured by the sequential improvements in its retail share 

  

in the united states under a contract growing program known as the tobacco farmers partnering program pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers under the terms of this program pm usa agrees to purchase all of the tobacco that participating growers may sell without penalty under the federal tobacco program pm usa also purchases its united states tobacco requirements through other sources 

  

tobacco production in the united states is subject to government controls including the tobaccoprice support and production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the “usda” in addition oriental fluecured and burley tobaccos are purchased outside the united states tobacco production outside the united states is subject to a variety of controls and external factors which may include tobacco subsidies and tobacco production control programs all of those controls and programs in the united states and internationally may substantially affect market prices for tobacco 

  

pm usa and pmi believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements

acquisitions and divestitures 

  

during 2003 kfna acquired trademarks associated with a small natural foods business and kfi acquired a biscuits business in egypt the total cost of these and other smaller businesses purchased by kraft during 2003 was 98 million during 2002 kfi acquired a snacks business in turkey and a biscuits business in australia the total cost of these and smaller businesses purchased by kraft during 2002 was 122 million during 2001 kfi purchased coffee businesses in romania morocco and bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in russia and poland the total cost of these and other smaller food acquisitions during 2001 was 194 million 

  

during 2003 kfi sold a european rice business and a branded fresh cheese business in italy the aggregate proceeds received from the sales of businesses in 2003 were 96 million on which pretax gains of 31 million were recorded during 2002 kraft sold several small north american food businesses most of which were previously classified as businesses held for sale the net revenues and operating results of the businesses held for sale which were not significant were excluded from altria group inc’s consolidated statements of earnings and no gain or loss was recognized on these sales in addition kraft sold a latin american yeast and industrial bakery ingredients business for approximately 110 million and recorded a pretax gain of 69 million the aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses during 2002 were 219 million resulting in pretax gains of 80 million during 2001 kraft sold several small food businesses the aggregate proceeds received in these transactions were 21 million on which pretax gains of 8 million were recorded 

  

the impact of these acquisitions and divestitures has not had a material effect on altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations

distribution competition and raw materials 

  

kfna’s products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating food products are distributed through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities most distribution in north america is in the form of warehouse delivery but biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two directstoredelivery systems selling efforts are supported by national and regional advertising on television and radio as well as outdoor media such as billboards and in magazines and newspapers as well as by sales promotions product displays trade incentives informative material offered to customers and other promotional activities subsidiaries and affiliates of kfi sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents 

  

kraft is subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of its business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors may have different profit objectives and some competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates in addition certain international competitors benefit from government subsidies kraft’s food products also compete with generic products and privatelabel products of food retailers wholesalers and cooperatives kraft competes primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brand’s market position or to introduce a new product 

  

kraft is a major purchaser of milk cheese nuts green coffee beans cocoa corn products wheat rice pork poultry beef vegetable oil and sugar and other sweeteners it also uses significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard to package its products kraft continuously monitors worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities to enable it to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

  

kraft purchases a substantial portion of its dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and individual processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government programs as well as by market supply and demand dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2003 than those seen in 2002 

  

the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply trade agreements among producing and consuming nations the unilateral policies of the producing nations 

  

changes in the value of the united states dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products coffee bean costs on average during 2003 were higher than in 2002 

  

a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound sterling and the united states dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean costs on average during 2003 were higher than in 2002 

  

the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in kraft’s food products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors kraft believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources kraft uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials however kraft does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect kraft from increases in specific raw material costs 

  

regulation 

  

all of kfna’s united states food products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the food and drug administration the “fda” or with respect to products containing meat and poultry the usda among other things these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated foods establish safety standards for food processing establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods establish standards of identity for certain foods determine the safety of food additives and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products 

  

in addition various states regulate the business of kfna’s operating units by licensing dairy plants enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

  

many of the food commodities on which kfna’s united states businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review 

  

almost all of the activities of kraft’s operations outside of the united states are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to kfna’s united states businesses and in some cases international regulatory provisions such as those of the european union the “eu” relating to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

  

the eu and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled accordingly other countries may adopt similar regulations the fda has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current united states law 

  

business environment 

  

portions of the information called for by this item are hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs captioned “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—operating results by business segment—food business environment” on pages 28 to 29 of the 2003 annual report and made a part hereof 

  

financial services 

  

pmcc is primarily engaged in leasing activities total assets of pmcc were 85 billion at december 31 2003 down from 92 billion at december 31 2002 reflecting a decrease in finance assets net due to asset sales during 2003 pmcc shifted its strategic focus from an emphasis on the growth of its portfolio of finance leases through new investments to one of maximizing investment gains and generating cash flows from its existing portfolio of leased assets accordingly pmcc’s operating companies income will continue to decrease as lease investments mature or are sold pmcc’s finance asset portfolio includes leases in the following investment categories aircraft electrical power real estate manufacturing surface transportation and energy industries finance assets net are comprised of total lease payments receivable and the residual value of assets under lease reduced by thirdparty nonrecourse debt and unearned income the payment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized only by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to all other assets of pmcc or altria group inc as required by accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the thirdparty nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rentals receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net in altria group inc’s consolidated balance sheets 

  

during 2003 pmcc received proceeds from asset sales and maturities of 507 million and recorded gains of 45 million in operating companies income 

  

among its leasing activities pmcc leases a number of aircraft predominantly to major united states carriers at december 31 2003 approximately 26 or 23 billion of pmcc’s investment in finance leases related to aircraft in recognition of the economic downturn in the airline industry pmcc increased its allowance for losses by 290 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 developments in the airline industry during 2003 and 2002 that affected airline leases held by pmcc included the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

it is possible that further adverse developments in the airline industry may require pmcc to increase its allowance for losses in future periods 

  

other matters 

  

customers 

  

none of the business segments of the altria family of companies is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations however kraft’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 37 of its net revenues in 2003 one of kraft’s customers walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 12 of kraft’s net revenues in 2003 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2003 alg and its subsidiaries employed approximately 165000 people worldwide in january 2004 kraft announced a threeyear restructuring program that is expected to eliminate approximately 6000 positions 

  

trademarks 

  

trademarks are of material importance to alg’s consumer products subsidiaries and are protected by registration or otherwise in the united states and most other markets where the related products are sold 

  

environmental regulation 

  

alg and its subsidiaries are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection including the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” which imposes joint and several liability on each responsible party in 2003 subsidiaries or former subsidiaries of alg were involved in approximately 105 active matters subjecting them to potential remediation costs under superfund or otherwise alg’s subsidiaries 

  

expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations although it is not possible to predict precise levels of environmentalrelated expenditures compliance with such laws and regulations including the payment of any remediation costs and the making of such expenditures has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations capital expenditures financial position earnings or competitive position 

  

cautionary factors that may affect future results 

  

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

  

we  may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in altria group inc’s securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document and in the portions of the 2003 annual report that are incorporated herein by reference particularly in the “business environment” sections of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time 

  

tobaccorelated litigation  there is substantial litigation related to tobacco products in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation range into the billions of dollars although to date our tobacco subsidiaries have never had to pay a judgment in a tobaccorelated case there are presently 13 cases on appeal in which verdicts were returned against pm usa including a compensatory and punitive damages verdict totaling approximately 101 billion in the price case in illinois generally in order to prevent a plaintiff from seeking to collect a judgment while the verdict is being appealed the defendant must post an appeal bond frequently in the amount of the judgment or more or negotiate an alternative arrangement with plaintiffs in the event of future losses at trial we may not always be able to obtain the required bond or to negotiate an acceptable alternative arrangement 

  

the present litigation environment is substantially uncertain and it is possible that our business volume results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation including certain of the verdicts against us that are on appeal we intend to continue vigorously defending all tobaccorelated litigation although we may 

  

   

enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in the best interest of our stockholders to do so please see note 18 and item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion of pending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

antitobacco action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking and seeking to hold us responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect this decline to continue 

  

excise taxes  cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states and to substantial taxation abroad significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted within the united states the eu and in other foreign jurisdictions these tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes by our tobacco subsidiaries due to lower consumption levels and to a shift in sales from the premium to the nonpremium or discount segments or to sales outside of legitimate channels 

  

increased competition in the domestic tobacco market  settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces increased competition from lowest priced brands sold by certain domestic and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to these settlements these manufacturers may fail to comply with related state escrow legislation or may take advantage of certain provisions in the legislation that permit the nonsettling manufacturers to concentrate their sales in a limited number of states and thereby avoid escrow deposit obligations on the majority of their sales additional competition has resulted from diversion into the united states market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes and increased imports of foreign lowest priced brands the competitive environment has been characterized by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence a continued influx of cheap products and higher prices due to higher state excise taxes and list price increases as a result the lowest priced products of manufacturers of numerous small share brands have increased their market share putting pressure on the profitability of the industry’s premium segment 

  

governmental investigations  from time to time alg and its tobacco subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters ongoing investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain international markets and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 

  

new tobacco product technologies  our tobacco subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking their goal is to reduce constituents in tobacco smoke identified by public health authorities as harmful while continuing to offer adult smokers products that meet their taste expectations we cannot guarantee that our tobacco subsidiaries will succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors do our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

  

foreign currency  our international food and tobacco subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting their results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

  

competition and economic downturns  each of our consumer products subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and local economic conditions to be successful they must continue to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the willingness of consumers to purchase premium cigarette brands and premium food and beverage brands depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label and other economy brands and the volume of our consumer products subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  

our finance subsidiary pmcc holds investments in finance leases principally in transportation including aircraft power generation real estate manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if counterparties to pmcc’s leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

grocery trade consolidation  as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers grow larger and become more sophisticated they demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs further these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products if kraft fails to use its scale marketing expertise branded products and category leadership positions to respond to these trends its volume growth could slow or it may need to lower prices or increase promotional support of its products any of which would adversely affect profitability 

  

continued need to add food and beverage products in faster growing and more profitable categories  the food and beverage industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth kraft’s success depends in part on its ability to grow its business faster than populations are growing in the markets that it serves one way to achieve that growth is to enhance its portfolio by adding products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories if kraft does not succeed in making these enhancements its volume growth may slow which would adversely affect our profitability 

  

strengthening brand portfolios through acquisitions and divestitures  one element of the growth strategy of kraft and pmi is to strengthen their brand portfolios through active programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures these subsidiaries are constantly investigating potential acquisition candidates also from time to time kraft sells businesses that are outside its core categories or that do not meet their growth or profitability targets acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  

food raw material prices  the raw materials used by our food businesses are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity 

  

price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging cost and our operating subsidiaries may be unable to increase their prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume net revenue and operating companies income we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not work as planned 

  

food safety quality and health concerns  we could be adversely affected if consumers in kraft’s principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products adverse publicity about these types of concerns like the recent publicity about genetically modified organisms and “mad cow disease” in europe and north america whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying kraft’s products or cause production and delivery disruptions recent publicity concerning the health implications of obesity and transfatty acids could also reduce consumption of certain of kraft’s products in addition kraft may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or misbranded kraft may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause products to be unavailable for a period of time and a loss of consumer confidence in kraft’s food products and could have a material adverse effect on kraft’s business 

  

limited access to commercial paper market  as a result of actions by credit rating agencies during 2003 alg currently has limited access to the commercial paper market and may have to rely on its revolving credit facilities as well

smoking and health class actions 

  

since the dismissal in may 1996 of a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of “addicted” smokers plaintiffs have filed numerous putative smoking and health class action suits in various state and federal courts in general these cases purport to be brought on behalf of residents of a particular state or states although a few cases purport to be nationwide in scope and raise addiction claims and in many cases claims of physical injury as well 

  

class certification has been denied or reversed by courts in 56 smoking and health class actions involving pm usa in arkansas the district of columbia 2 florida the engle case illinois 2 iowa kansas louisiana maryland michigan minnesota nevada 29 new jersey 6 new york 2 ohio oklahoma pennsylvania puerto rico south carolina texas and wisconsin a class remains certified in the scott class action discussed below 

  

in july 2003 following the first phase of the trial in the scott class action in which plaintiffs seek creation of funds to pay for medical monitoring and smoking cessation programs a louisiana jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants including pm usa in connection with plaintiffs’ medical monitoring claims but also found that plaintiffs could benefit from smoking cessation assistance the jury also found that cigarettes as designed are not defective but that the defendants failed to disclose all they knew about smoking and diseases and marketed their products to minors the jury was not permitted to award damages during this phase of the trial the second phase of the trial is scheduled to begin in march 2004 in november 2001 in the first medical monitoring class action case to go to trial a west virginia jury returned a verdict in favor of all defendants including pm usa and plaintiffs have appealed in february 2003 the west virginia supreme court agreed to hear plaintiffs’ appeal and the parties are awaiting the supreme court’s decision 

  

health care cost recovery litigation 

  

overview 

  

in health care cost recovery litigation domestic and foreign governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees 

  

the claims asserted include the claim that cigarette manufacturers were “unjustly enriched” by plaintiffs’ payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking as well as claims of indemnity negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state antiracketeering statutes 

  

defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law “unclean hands” namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to “set off” any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiff benefits economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by “standing in the shoes” of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  

although there have been some decisions to the contrary most judicial decisions have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers nine federal circuit courts of appeals and four state intermediate appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs’ claims were too remote have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs’ appeals from the cases decided by five circuit courts of appeals 

  

a number of foreign governmental entities have filed health care cost recovery actions in the united states such suits have been brought in the united states by 13 countries a canadian province 11 brazilian states and 11 brazilian cities thirtytwo of the cases have been dismissed and four remain pending in addition to the cases brought in the united states health care cost recovery actions have also been brought in israel the marshall islands dismissed canada france and spain and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions in september 2003 the case pending in france was dismissed and plaintiff has appealed 

  

in march 1999 in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial an ohio jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts in june 2001 a new york jury returned a verdict awarding 683 million in compensatory damages against pm usa and a total of 11 million against four other defendants in a health care cost recovery action brought by a blue cross and blue shield plan and defendants including pm usa appealed see the discussion of the empire blue cross and blue shield case above under the heading “recent trial results” for the posttrial developments in this case 

  

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  

in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the “msa” with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the “state settlement agreements” the state settlement agreements require that the domestic tobacco industry make substantial annual payments in the following amounts excluding future annual payments contemplated by the agreement 

  

with tobacco growers discussed below subject to adjustments for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume 2004 through 2007 84 billion each year and thereafter 94 billion each year in addition the domestic tobacco industry is required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million pm usa’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers’ domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due pm usa records its portions of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped these payment obligations are the several and not joint obligations of each of the settling defendants 

  

the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  

as part of the msa the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobaccogrowing states to address concerns about the potential adverse economic impact of the msa on tobacco growers and quotaholders to that end four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa and the grower states have established a trust fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quotaholders the trust will be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments prior to application of various adjustments scheduled to total 515 billion future industry payments 2004 through 2008 500 million each year 2009 and 2010 295 million each year are subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation united states cigarette volume and certain contingent events and in general are to be allocated based on each manufacturer’s relative market share pm usa records its portion of these payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped 

  

the state settlement agreements have materially adversely affected the volumes of pm usa and alg believes that they may also materially adversely affect the results of operations cash flows or financial position of pm usa and altria group inc in future periods the degree of the adverse impact will depend on among other things the rate of decline in united states cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments pm usa’s share of the domestic premium and discount cigarette segments and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the msa and the other state settlement agreements 

  

in january a case in new york in which pm usa was a defendant and in which plaintiffs challenged the validity of the msa and alleged that the msa violates antitrust laws was dismissed pursuant to the stipulation of the parties in february 2004 the united states supreme court denied plaintiffs’ petition for further review of a case in pennsylvania in which plaintiffs also alleged that the msa violates antitrust laws 

  

federal government’s lawsuit 

  

in 1999 the united states government filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against various cigarette manufacturers and others including pm usa and alg asserting claims under three federal statutes the medical care recovery act “mcra” the medicare secondary payer “msp” provisions of the social security act and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act “rico” the lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of health care costs for tobaccorelated illnesses allegedly caused by defendants’ fraudulent and tortious conduct and paid for by the government under various federal health care programs including medicare military and veterans’ health benefits programs and the federal employees health benefits program the complaint alleges that such costs total more than 20 billion annually it also seeks what it alleges to be equitable and declaratory relief including disgorgement of profits which arose from defendants’ 

  

allegedly tortious conduct an injunction prohibiting certain actions by the defendants and a declaration that the defendants are liable for the federal government’s future costs of providing health care resulting from defendants’ alleged past tortious and wrongful conduct pm usa and alg moved to dismiss this lawsuit on numerous grounds including that the statutes invoked by the government do not provide a basis for the relief sought in september 2000 the trial court dismissed the government’s mcra and msp claims but permitted discovery to proceed on the government’s claims for relief under rico in january 2003 the government and defendants submitted preliminary proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law rebuttals were filed in april the government alleges that disgorgement by defendants of approximately 280 billion is an appropriate remedy in may 2003 the court denied defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment seeking to dismiss the claims related to advertising marketing promotions and health warnings in january 2004 the court granted one of the government’s pending motions and dismissed certain equitable defenses of defendants in february 2004 the court denied defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment seeking to dismiss the claims relating to marketing to youth in march 2004 the court addressed another government motion declining to dismiss defenses that rely on the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment and dismissing defenses that rely on the constitutional prohibition of retroactive application of penal laws the remaining motions for summary judgment filed by the government and defendants are still pending trial of the case is currently scheduled for september 2004

it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against alg and its subsidiaries litigation is subject to many uncertainties as discussed above under “recent trial results” unfavorable verdicts awarding substantial damages against pm usa have been returned in 13 cases since 1999 and these cases are in various posttrial stages it is possible that there could be further 

  

adverse developments in these cases and that additional cases could be decided unfavorably in the event of an adverse trial result in certain pending litigation the defendant may not be able to obtain a required bond or obtain relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent a plaintiff from seeking to collect a judgment while an adverse verdict is being appealed an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation there have also been a number of adverse legislative regulatory political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry that have received widespread media attention these developments may negatively affect the perception of judges and jurors with respect to the tobacco industry possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation 

  

alg and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings  i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated litigation ii management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobaccorelated litigation and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any 

  

the present legislative and litigation environment is substantially uncertain and it is possible that the business and volume of alg’s subsidiaries as well as altria group inc’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation or by the enactment of federal or state tobacco legislation alg and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has a number of valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however alg and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of alg’s stockholders to do so

c narrative description of business 

tobacco products 

  pm usa manufactures markets and sells cigarettes in the united states and its territories and exports tobacco products from the united states subsidiaries and affiliates of pmi and their licensees manufacture market and sell tobacco products outside the united states 

domestic tobacco products 

  pm usa is the largest tobacco company in the united states with total cigarette shipments in the united states of 1916 billion units in 2002 a decrease of 75 from 2001 pm usa accounted for 489 of the domestic cigarette industrys total shipments in 2002 a decrease of 21 share points from 2001 the domestic industrys cigarette shipments decreased by 37 in 2002 the industrys volume 

—————  management reviews operating companies income which is defined as operating income before corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to assist investors with analyzing business performance and trends this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 

  decrease during 2002 was due primarily to weak economic conditions increases in state excise taxes and the increased incidence of counterfeit product in addition to these factors pm usas volume decrease was also attributable to the growth of deepdiscount cigarettes and competitive promotional activity the following table sets forth the industrys cigarette shipments in the united states pm usas shipments and its share of domestic industry shipments 

   pm usas major premium brands are marlboro virginia slims and parliament its principal discount brand is basic all of its brands are marketed to take into account differing preferences of adult smokers marlboro is the largestselling cigarette brand in the united states with shipments of 1486 billion units in 2002 down 58 from 2001 equating to 379 of the domestic market down 09 share points from 2001 

  in 2002 the premium and discount segments accounted for approximately 73 and 27 respectively of the domestic cigarette industry volume in 2001 the premium and discount segments accounted for approximately 74 and 26 respectively of the domestic cigarette industry volume pm usas share of the premium segment was 607 in 2002 a decrease of 09 share points from 2001 shipments of premium cigarettes accounted for 902 of pm usas 2002 volume up from 893 in 2001 in 2002 industry shipments within the discount category increased 04 from 2001 levels pm usas 2002 shipments within this category decreased 156 resulting in a share of 176 of the discount category down 33 share points from 2001 

  pm usa cannot predict future changes or rates of change in domestic tobacco industry volume in the relative sizes of the premium and discount segments or in pm usas shipments shipment market share or retail market share however it believes that pm usas results have been and may continue to be materially adversely affected by price increases related to increased excise taxes and tobacco litigation settlements as well as by the other tobacco legislation discussed below 

  as set forth in note 18 to altria group incs consolidated financial statements note 18 which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2002 annual report on may 7 2001 the trial court in the engle class action approved a stipulation among pm usa certain other defendants and the plaintiffs providing that the execution or enforcement of the punitive damages component of the judgment in that case will remain stayed through the completion of all judicial review as a result of the stipulation pm usa placed 500 million into a separate interestbearing escrow account that regardless of the outcome of the appeal will be paid to the court and the court will determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with the florida rules of civil procedure as a result a 500 million pretax charge was recorded in the operating companies income of the domestic tobacco business during the first quarter of 2001 in july 2001 pm usa also placed 12 billion into an interestbearing escrow account which will be returned to pm usa should it prevail in its appeal of the case the 12 billion escrow account is included in the december 31 2002 and 2001 consolidated balance sheets as other assets interest income on the 12 billion escrow account is paid to pm usa quarterly 

 source management science associates it should be noted that management science associates current measurements of the domestic cigarette industrys total shipments and related share data do not include all shipments of some manufacturers that management science associates is presently unable to monitor effectively accordingly it should also be noted that the discussion herein of pm usas performance within the industry is based upon management science associates estimates of total industry volume 3

  international tobacco products 

  pmis total cigarette shipments increased 35 in 2002 to 7231 billion units pmi estimates that its share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states and dutyfree shipments was approximately 147 in 2002 up from 141 in 2001 pmi estimates that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 48 trillion units in 2002 a slight decrease from 2001 pmis leading brands— marlboro lm philip morris bond street chesterfield parliament lark merit and virginia slims —collectively accounted for approximately 114 of the international cigarette market up from 108 in 2001 shipments of pmis principal brand marlboro decreased 06 in 2002 and represented more than 6 of the international cigarette market in 2002 and 2001 

  pmi has a cigarette market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in more than 60 markets including argentina austria belgium brazil the czech republic finland france germany greece hong kong israel italy japan malaysia mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal romania russia saudi arabia singapore spain switzerland turkey and the ukraine 

  in 2002 pmi continued to invest in and expand its international manufacturing base including significant investments in facilities located in germany korea the netherlands the philippines poland portugal and russia 

distribution competition and raw materials 

  pm usa sells its tobacco products principally to wholesalers including distributors large retail organizations including chain stores and the armed services subsidiaries and affiliates of pmi and their licensees sell their tobacco products worldwide to distributors wholesalers retailers and stateowned enterprises and other customers 

  the market for tobacco products is highly competitive characterized by brand recognition and loyalty with product quality price marketing and packaging constituting the significant methods of competition promotional activities include in certain instances and where permitted by law allowances the distribution of incentive items price reductions and other discounts the tobacco products of algs subsidiaries affiliates and their licensees are advertised and promoted through various media although television and radio advertising of cigarettes is prohibited in the united states and is prohibited or restricted in many other countries in addition as discussed below under taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding tobacco and smoking—state settlement agreements pm usa and other domestic tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the united states as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions 

  during 2002 weak economic conditions with resultant consumer frugality and higher state excise taxes have resulted in intense price competition in the us cigarette industry these factors have significantly affected shipments of pm usas products which compete predominantly in the premium category pm usa has planned significant promotional activities in 2003 to address these issues the cost of these programs is expected to reduce operating companies income for pm usa during 2003 as compared with 2002 

  in the united states pm usa purchases burley and fluecured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles in 2000 pm usa began a pilot partnering program with burley tobacco growers and extended the program to fluecured tobacco growers in 2001 under the terms of the program pm usa agrees to purchase all of the tobacco that participating growers may sell without penalty under the federal tobacco program pm usa also purchases its united states tobacco requirements at auction and through other sources 

  tobacco production in the united states is subject to government controls including the tobaccoprice support and production control programs administered by the united states department of agriculture the usda oriental fluecured and burley tobaccos are also purchased outside the united states tobacco production outside the united states is subject to a variety of controls and external factors which may include tobacco subsidies and tobacco production control programs all of 

  those controls and programs in the united states and internationally may substantially affect market prices for tobacco 

  pm usa and pmi believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding tobacco and smoking 

  the tobacco industry both in the united states and foreign jurisdictions has faced and continues to face a number of issues that may adversely affect the business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position of pm usa pmi and altria group inc 

  these issues some of which are more fully discussed below include 

   excise taxes  cigarettes are subject to substantial federal state and local excise taxes in the united states and to similar taxes in most foreign markets in general such taxes have been increasing the united states federal excise tax on cigarettes is currently 039 per pack of 20 cigarettes in the united states state and local sales and excise taxes vary considerably and when combined with sales taxes local taxes and the current federal excise tax may currently be as high as 410 per pack of 20 cigarettes further tax increases in various jurisdictions are currently under consideration or pending in 2002 20 

  states the district of colombia and the commonwealth of puerto rico enacted excise tax increases ranging from 007 per pack in tennessee to as much as 181 per pack in new york congress has considered significant increases in the federal excise tax or other payments from tobacco manufacturers and significant increases in excise and other cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted at the state and local levels within the united states and in many jurisdictions outside the united states in the european union the eu taxes on cigarettes vary considerably and currently may be as high as the equivalent of 569 per pack of 20 cigarettes on the most popular brands using an exchange rate at january 2 2003 of a  €100  10446 in germany where total tax on cigarettes is currently equivalent to 250 per pack of 19 cigarettes on the most popular brands the excise tax increased by the equivalent of 020 per pack of 19 cigarettes in january 2003 in the opinion of pm usa and pmi increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes particularly the legitimate sales of cigarettes and create an incentive for smokers to turn to untaxed or lowertaxed products any future increases the extent of which cannot be predicted may result in volume declines for the cigarette industry including pm usa and pmi and might also cause sales to shift from the premium segment to the nonpremium including the discount segment 

  each of the countries currently anticipated to join the eu by 2004 will be required to increase excise tax levels on cigarettes to eu standards by a date negotiated with the eu in all cases to levels that may produce the results described above 

  tar and nicotine test methods and brand descriptors  several jurisdictions have questioned the utility of standardized test methods to measure tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes in 1997 the united states federal trade commission ftc issued a request for public comment on its proposed revision of its tar and nicotine test methodology and reporting procedures established by a 1970 voluntary agreement among domestic cigarette manufacturers in 1998 the ftc requested assistance from the department of health and human services hhs in developing a testing program for the tar nicotine and carbon monoxide content of cigarettes in 2001 the national cancer institute issued a report stating that there was no meaningful evidence of a difference in smoke exposure or risk to smokers between cigarettes with different machinemeasured tar and nicotine yields in september 2002 pm usa petitioned the ftc to promulgate new rules governing the disclosure of average tar and nicotine yields of cigarette brands pm usa asked the ftc to take action in response to evolving scientific evidence about machinemeasured lowyield cigarettes including the national cancer institutes monograph 13 which represents a fundamental departure from the scientific and public health communitys prior thinking about the health effects of lowyield cigarettes public health officials in other countries and the eu have stated that the use of terms such as lights to describe lowyield cigarettes is misleading some jurisdictions have questioned the relevance of the method for measuring tar nicotine and carbon monoxide yields established by the international organization for standardization the eu commission has been directed to establish a committee to address among other things alternative methods for measuring tar nicotine and carbon monoxide yields in addition public health authorities in the united states the eu brazil and other countries have prohibited or called for the prohibition of the use of brand descriptors such as lights and ultra lights see item 3 which describes pending litigation concerning the use of brand descriptors 

  food and drug administration fda regulations  in 1996 the fda promulgated regulations asserting jurisdiction over cigarettes as drugs or medical devices under the provisions of the food drug and cosmetic act fdca the regulations which included severe restrictions on the distribution marketing and advertising of cigarettes and would have required the industry to comply with a wide range of labeling reporting record keeping manufacturing and other requirements were declared invalid by the united states supreme court in 2000 pm usa has stated that while it continues to oppose fda regulation over cigarettes as drugs or medical devices under the provisions of the fdca it would support new legislation that would provide for reasonable regulation by the fda of cigarettes as cigarettes currently there are bills pending in congress that if enacted would give the fda authority to regulate tobacco products pm usa has expressed support for certain of the bills the bills take a variety of approaches to the issue ranging from codification of the original fda regulations under the drug and medical device provisions of the fdca to the creation of provisions that would apply uniquely to tobacco products all of the pending legislation could result in 

  substantial federal regulation of the design performance manufacture and marketing of cigarettes the ultimate outcome of any congressional action regarding the pending bills cannot be predicted 

  ingredient disclosure laws  jurisdictions inside and outside the united states have enacted or proposed legislation or regulations that would require cigarette manufacturers to disclose the ingredients used in the manufacture of cigarettes and in certain cases to provide toxicological information the commonwealth of massachusetts enacted legislation to require cigarette manufacturers to report the flavorings and other ingredients used in each brandstyle of cigarettes sold in the commonwealth cigarette manufacturers sued to have the statute declared unconstitutional arguing that it could result in the public disclosure of valuable proprietary information in september 2000 the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the defendants from requiring cigarette manufacturers to disclose brandspecific information on ingredients in their products and defendants appealed in december 2002 the united states court of appeals for the first circuit sitting en banc affirmed the district courts entry of summary judgment the deadline for the commonwealth to file a petition for certiorari in the us supreme court was march 3 2003 and the commonwealth did not file such a petition ingredient disclosure legislation has been enacted or proposed in other states and in jurisdictions outside the united states including the eu under an eu tobacco product directive tobacco companies are now required to disclose ingredients and toxicological information to each member state in december 2002 pmi submitted this information to all eu member states in a form it believes complies with the directive pmi has also voluntarily disclosed the ingredients in its brands in a number of other countries other jurisdictions have also enacted or proposed legislation that would require the submission of information about ingredients and would permit governments to prohibit the use of certain ingredients 

  health effects of smoking and exposure to ets  reports with respect to the health risks of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years and sale promotion and use of cigarettes continue to be subject to increasing governmental regulation since 1964 the surgeon general of the united states and the secretary of hhs have released a number of reports linking cigarette smoking with a broad range of health hazards including various types of cancer coronary heart disease and chronic lung disease and recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking the 1988 1990 1992 and 1994 reports focused on the addictive nature of cigarettes the effects of smoking cessation the decrease in smoking in the united states the economic and regulatory aspects of smoking in the western hemisphere and cigarette smoking by adolescents particularly the addictive nature of cigarette smoking during adolescence 

  studies with respect to the health risks of ets to nonsmokers including lung cancer respiratory and coronary illnesses and other conditions have also received significant publicity in 1986 the surgeon general of the united states and the national academy of sciences reported that nonsmokers were at increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness due to ets since then a number of government agencies around the world have concluded that ets causes diseases—including lung cancer and heart disease—in nonsmokers in 2002 the international agency for research on cancer concluded that ets is carcinogenic and that exposure to ets causes diseases in nonsmokers 

  it is the policy of each of pm usa and pmi to support a single consistent public health message on the health effects of cigarette smoking in the development of diseases in smokers and on smoking and addiction it is also their policy to defer to the judgment of public health authorities as to the content of warnings in advertisements and on product packaging regarding the health effects of smoking addiction and exposure to ets 

  in 1999 pm usa and pmi established web sites that include among other things views of public health authorities on smoking disease causation in smokers addiction and ets in october 2000 the sites were updated to reflect pm usas and pmis agreement with the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that cigarette smoking is addictive and causes lung cancer heart disease emphysema and other serious diseases in smokers the web sites advise smokers and those considering smoking to rely on the messages of public health authorities in making all smokingrelated decisions 

  the sites also state that public health officials have concluded that ets causes or increases the risk of disease—including lung cancer and heart disease—in nonsmoking adults and causes conditions in children such as asthma respiratory infections cough wheeze otitis media middle ear infection and 

  sudden infant death syndrome the sites also state that public health officials have concluded that secondhand smoke can exacerbate adult asthma and cause eye throat and nasal irritation the site also states that the public should be guided by the conclusions of public health officials regarding the health effects of ets in deciding whether to be in places where ets is present or if they are smokers when and where to smoke around others in addition pm usa and pmi state on their web sites that they believe that particular care should be exercised where children are concerned and adults should avoid smoking around children pm usa and pmi also state that the conclusions of the public health officials concerning ets are sufficient to warrant measures that regulate smoking in public places and that where smoking is permitted the government should require the posting of warning notices that communicate public health officials conclusions that secondhand smoke causes diseases in nonsmokers 

  the world health organizations framework convention for tobacco control  the world health organization who and its member states are negotiating a proposed framework convention for tobacco control the proposed treaty recommends and in certain instances requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would among other things 

   pm usa and pmi have stated that they would support a treaty that member states could consider for ratification based on the following four principles 

   the sixth round of treaty negotiations was recently concluded and the who has indicated that the draft treaty will be presented for ratification to the world health assembly in may 2003 the outcome of the treaty negotiations cannot be predicted 

  other legislative initiatives  in recent years various members of the united states congress have introduced legislation some of which has been the subject of hearings or floor debate that would 

 8

     legislative initiatives affecting the regulation of the tobacco industry have also been considered or adopted in a number of jurisdictions outside the united states in 2001 the eu adopted a directive on tobacco product regulation requiring eu member states to implement regulations that 

   eu member states are in the process of implementing these regulations over the course of 2003 and 2004 the european commission is currently working on guidelines for graphic warnings on cigarette packaging which are expected to be issued in 2003 the eu is also considering a new directive that would restrict radio press and internet tobacco marketing and advertising that cross member state borders tobacco control legislation addressing the manufacture marketing and sale of tobacco products has been proposed in numerous other jurisdictions 

  in august 2000 new york state enacted legislation that requires the states office of fire prevention and control to promulgate by january 1 2003 firesafety standards for cigarettes sold in new york the legislation requires that cigarettes sold in new york stop burning within a time period to be specified by the standards or meet other performance standards set by the office of fire prevention and control all cigarettes sold in new york will be required to meet the established standards within 180 days after the standards are promulgated on december 31 2002 the new york state office of fire prevention and control published a proposed regulation to implement this legislation pm usa plans to submit comments concerning the proposed regulation and will continue to participate in the public comment process it is however not possible to predict the impact of the new york state law until the regulation is promulgated similar legislation is being considered in other states and localities at the federal level and in jurisdictions outside the united states 

  it is not possible to predict what if any additional foreign or domestic governmental legislation or regulations will be adopted relating to the manufacturing advertising sale or use of cigarettes or the tobacco industry generally however if any or all of the foregoing were to be implemented the business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position of pm usa pmi and altria group inc could be materially adversely affected 

  governmental investigations  altria group inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters including those discussed below alg believes that canadian authorities are contemplating a legal proceeding based on an investigation of pmi and its subsidiary philip morris duty free inc relating to allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes into canada in the early to mid1990s during 2001 the competition authorities in italy and turkey initiated investigations into the pricing activities by participants in those cigarette markets the investigation in turkey was closed after that countrys competition board issued a ruling that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the turkish affiliate of pmi had violated competition laws in march 2003 the italian competition authority issued its findings and imposed fines totaling €50 million on certain affiliates of pmi the parties will have the right to 

  appeal the authoritys findings and any fines before the administrative court and thereafter before the supreme administrative court and pmis affiliates intend to appeal in 2002 the italian authorities at the request of a consumer group initiated an investigation into the use of descriptors for marlboro lights the investigation is directed at pmis german and dutch affiliates which manufacture product for sale in italy the competition authority issued its decision in september 2002 finding that the use of the term lights on the packaging of the marlboro lights brand is misleading advertising under italian law but that it was not necessary to take any action because the use of the term lights will be prohibited as of october 2003 under the eu directive on tobacco product regulation the consumer group that requested the investigation indicated that it would appeal the decision but did not do so within the permitted time period the group has also requested that the public prosecutor in naples italy investigate whether a crime has been committed under italian law with regard to the use of the term lights in october 2002 the consumer group filed new requests with the competition authority asking for investigation of the use of descriptors for additional lowyield brands including merit ultra lights and certain brands manufactured by other companies in 2001 authorities in australia initiated an investigation into the use of descriptors alleging that their use was false and misleading the investigation is directed at one of pmis australian affiliates and other cigarette manufacturers pmi cannot predict the outcome of these investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced 

  tobaccorelated litigation  there is substantial litigation pending related to tobacco products in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions see item 3 for a discussion of such litigation 

  state settlement agreements  as discussed in item 3 during 1997 and 1998 pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into agreements with states and various united states jurisdictions settling asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims these settlements provide for substantial annual payments they also place numerous restrictions on the tobacco industrys business operations including restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes among these are restrictions or prohibitions on the following 

   in addition the settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at

acquisitions and divestitures 

  nabisco acquisition 

  on december 11 2000 kraft acquired all of the outstanding shares of nabisco holdings corp nabisco the purchase of the outstanding shares retirement of employee stock options and other payments totaled approximately 152 billion in addition the acquisition included the assumption of approximately 40 billion of existing nabisco debt for a discussion of the nabisco acquisition see note 5 to altria group incs consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2002 annual report 

  the integration of nabisco into kraft has continued throughout 2001 and 2002 the closure of a number of nabisco domestic and international facilities resulted in severance and other exit costs of 379 million which are included in the adjustments for the allocation of the purchase price the closures will result in the termination of approximately 7500 employees and will require total cash payments of 373 million of which approximately 190 million has been spent through december 31 2002 substantially all of the closures were completed as of december 31 2002 and the remaining payments relate to salary continuation payments for severed employees and lease payments 

  the integration of nabisco into the operations of kraft also resulted in the closure or reconfiguration of several existing kraft facilities the aggregate charges to the consolidated statement of earnings to close or reconfigure facilities and integrate nabisco were originally estimated to be in the range of 200 million to 300 million during 2002 kraft recorded pretax integration related charges of 115 million to consolidate production lines and close facilities and for other consolidated programs in addition during 2001 kraft incurred pretax integration costs of 53 million for site reconfigurations and other consolidation programs in the united states the integration related charges of 168 million included 27 million relating to severance 117 million relating to asset writeoffs and 24 million relating to other cash exit costs cash payments relating to these charges will approximate 51 million of which 21 million has been paid through december 31 2002 in addition during 2002 approximately 700 salaried employees elected to retire or terminate employment under voluntary retirement programs as a result kraft recorded a pretax charge of 142 million related to these programs as of december 31 2002 the aggregate pretax charges to close or reconfigure krafts facilities and integrate nabisco including charges for early retirement programs were 310 million slightly above the original estimate no additional pretax charges are expected to be recorded for these programs 

  by combining nabiscos operations with the operations of kfna and kfi kraft achieved annualized net cost synergy savings of 425 million through 2002 from the preacquisition cost structures of continuing businesses expects to generate annualized additional net cost synergies of 140 million to 150 million in 2003 and expects to achieve its target of annualized net cost synergies of 600 million by 2004 

  other acquisitions and divestitures 

  during 2002 kfi acquired a snacks business in turkey and a biscuits business in australia the total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was 122 million during 2001 kfi purchased coffee businesses in romania morocco and bulgaria and also acquired confectionery businesses in russia and poland the total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was 194 million during 2000 kfna purchased balance bar co and boca burger inc the total cost of these and other smaller acquisitions was 365 million 

  during 2002 kraft sold several small north american food businesses some of which were previously classified as businesses held for sale in addition kraft sold its latin american yeast and industrial bakery ingredients business for 110 million and recorded a pretax gain of 69 million the aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses during 2002 were 219 million on which kraft recorded pretax gains of 80 million during 2001 kraft sold several small food businesses the aggregate proceeds received in these transactions were 21 million on which kraft recorded pretax 

  gains of 8 million during 2000 kraft sold a french confectionery business for proceeds of 251 million on which a pretax gain of 139 million was recorded several small international and north american food businesses were also sold in 2000 the aggregate proceeds received from sales of businesses during 2000 were 300 million on which kraft recorded pretax gains of 172 million

  kfnas products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating food products are distributed through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities most distribution in north america is in the form of warehouse delivery but biscuits and frozen pizza are distributed through two directstoredelivery systems selling efforts are supported by national and regional advertising on television and radio as well as outdoor media such as billboards and in magazines and newspapers as well as by sales promotions product displays trade incentives informative material offered to customers and other promotional activities subsidiaries and affiliates of kfi sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents 

  kraft is subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of its business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors may have different profit objectives and some competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates in addition certain international competitors benefit from government subsidies its food products also compete with generic products and privatelabel products of food retailers wholesalers and cooperatives kraft competes primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price substantial advertising and promotional expenditures are required to maintain or improve a brands market position or to introduce a new product 

  kraft is a major purchaser of milk cheese nuts green coffee beans cocoa corn products wheat rice pork poultry beef vegetable oil and sugar and other sweeteners it also uses significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard to package its products kraft continuously monitors worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities to enable it to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

  kraft purchases a substantial portion of its milk requirements from independent agricultural cooperatives and individual producers and a substantial portion of its cheese requirements from independent sources the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government programs as well as by market supply and demand dairy commodity costs on average were lower in 2002 than those seen in 2001 

  the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply trade agreements among producing and consuming nations the unilateral policies of the producing nations changes in the value of the united states dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products coffee bean prices during 2002 were lower than in 2001 

  a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound sterling and the united states dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean prices during 2002 were higher than in 2001 

  the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in food products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors kraft believes such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources kraft uses hedging techniques to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in its principal raw materials however kraft does not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect kraft from increases in specific raw material costs 

regulation 

  all of kfnas united states food products and packaging materials are subject to regulations administered by the fda or with respect to products containing meat and poultry the usda among 

  other things these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated foods establish safety standards for food processing establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods establish standards of identity for certain foods determine the safety of food additives and establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products 

  in addition various states regulate the business of kfnas operating units by licensing dairy plants enforcing federal and state standards of identity for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants regulating certain trade practices in connection with the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

  many of the food commodities on which kfnas united states businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review 

  almost all of the activities of krafts operations outside of the united states are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to kfnas united states businesses and in some cases international regulatory provisions such as those of the eu relating to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

  the eu and certain individual countries require that food products containing genetically modified organisms or classes of ingredients derived from them be labeled accordingly other countries may adopt similar regulations the fda has concluded that there is no basis for similar mandatory labeling under current united states law 

financial services 

  pmcc is primarily engaged in leasing activities total assets of pmcc were 92 billion at december 31 2002 up from 89 billion at december 31 2001 reflecting an increase in finance assets net pmccs finance asset portfolio includes leases in the following investment categories aircraft electrical power real estate manufacturing surface transportation and energy industries finance assets net are comprised of total lease payments receivable and the residual value of assets under lease reduced by nonrecourse thirdparty debt and unearned income pmcc has no obligation for the payment of the nonrecourse thirdparty debt issued to purchase the assets under lease the payment of the debt is collateralized only by lease payments receivable and the leased property and is nonrecourse to all other assets of pmcc or altria group inc as required by us gaap the nonrecourse thirdparty debt has been offset against the related rentals receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets net in altria group incs consolidated balance sheets 

  among other leasing activities pmcc leases a number of aircraft predominantly to major united states carriers at december 31 2002 approximately 27 or 26 billion of pmccs investment in finance leases related to aircraft 

  on august 11 2002 us airways group inc us air filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection pmcc currently leases 16 airbus a319 aircraft to us air under longterm leveraged leases which expire in 2018 and 2019 the aircraft were leased in 1998 and 1999 and represent an investment in finance leases of 150 million at december 31 2002 

  on december 9 2002 united air lines inc ual filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at that time pmcc leased 24 boeing 757 aircraft to ual 22 under longterm leveraged leases and 2 under longterm single investor leases subsequently pmcc purchased 239 million of senior nonrecourse debt on 16 of the aircraft under leveraged leases following which those leases were treated as single investor leases for accounting purposes as of february 28 2003 pmcc entered into an agreement with ual to amend those 16 leases as well as the 2 single investor leases among other modifications the subordinated debt outstanding on these 16 leveraged leases was cancelled as of february 28 2003 pmccs aggregate exposure to ual totaled 625 million 

  pmcc continues to evaluate the effect of the us air and ual bankruptcy filings while seeking to negotiate with us air and ual in their efforts to restructure and emerge from bankruptcy in this regard pmcc has entered into an agreement with us air whereby all of pmccs leases to us air are expected to be affirmed when us air emerges from bankruptcy pmcc ceased recording income on the leases as of the date of the bankruptcy filings 

    in recognition of the recent economic downturn in the airline industry pmcc increased its allowance for losses by 290 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 it is possible that further adverse developments in the airline industry may occur which might require pmcc to record an additional allowance for losses in future periods

  we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize 

——————  this section uses the term we our and us when it is not necessary to distinguish among alg and its various operating subsidiaries or when any distinction is clear from the context

  tobacco related litigation  there is substantial litigation pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions arising out of the tobacco businesses of pm usa and pmi we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed in some cases plaintiffs claim damages including punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars although to date our tobacco subsidiaries have never had to pay a judgment in a tobacco related case there are presently 11 cases in various posttrial stages in which verdicts were returned against pm usa including a 74 billion verdict in the engle case in florida a compensatory and punitive damages verdict totaling approximately 101 billion in the price case in illinois and four verdicts in california in the aggregate amount of 311 billion the trial courts in the california cases subsequently reduced the punitive damages awards to an aggregate of 163 million and these cases are being appealed in order to prevent a plaintiff from seeking to collect a judgment while the verdict is being appealed the defendant must post an appeal bond frequently in the amount of the judgment or more or negotiate an alternative arrangement with plaintiffs the judge in the price case set bond in the amount of 12 billion due on april 20 2003 it is not possible for pm usa to post such a bond and absent judicial or legislative relief pm usa would not be able to stay enforcement of the judgment in illinois in the event of future losses at trial the defendant may not always be able to obtain the required bond or to negotiate an acceptable alternative arrangement 

  the present litigation environment is substantially uncertain and it is possible that our business volume results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation including certain of the verdicts against us that are on appeal we intend to continue vigorously defending all tobacco related litigation although we may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in the best interest of our shareholders to do so please see note 18 to altria group incs consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2002 annual report and item 3 for a detailed discussion of tobacco related litigation 

  antitobacco action in the public and private sectors  our tobacco subsidiaries face significant governmental action aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking and seeking to hold us responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to ets governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect this decline to continue 

  excise taxes  substantial excise tax increases have been and continue to be imposed on cigarettes in the united states at the federal state and local levels as well as in foreign jurisdictions the resulting price increases have caused and may continue to cause consumers to shift from premium to nonpremium including discount brands and to cease or reduce smoking 

  increasing competition in the domestic tobacco market  settlements of certain tobacco litigation in the united states combined with excise tax increases have resulted in substantial cigarette price increases pm usa faces increased competition from lowest priced brands sold by domestic and foreign manufacturers that enjoy cost advantages because they are not making payments under the settlements or related state escrow legislation additional competition results from diversion into the domestic market of cigarettes intended for sale outside the united states the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by 

  third parties and increasing imports of foreign lowest priced brands recently the competitive environment has become even more challenging characterized by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence a continued influx of cheap products and higher prices due to higher state excise taxes and list price increases as a result the lowest priced products of manufacturers of numerous small share brands have increased their market share putting pressure on the industrys premium segment if these competitive factors continue and if the disparity in price between our premium brands and our competitors lowest priced brands continues to increase sales from the premium segment pm usas most profitable category may continue to shift to the discount segment steps that pm usa may take to reduce the price disparity such as increasing promotional spending may reduce the profitability of its premium brands or may not be successful 

  governmental investigations  from time to time our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters ongoing investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain international markets and allegations of false and misleading usage of the terms lights and ultra lights in brand descriptors we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 

  new tobacco product technologies  our tobacco subsidiaries continue to seek ways to develop and to commercialize new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking their goal is to reduce harmful constituents in tobacco smoke while continuing to offer adult smokers products that meet their taste expectations we cannot guarantee that our tobacco subsidiaries will succeed in these efforts if they do not succeed but one or more of their competitors do our tobacco subsidiaries may be at a competitive disadvantage 

  foreign currency  our international food and tobacco subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting their results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating companies income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 

  competition and economic downturns  each of our consumer products subsidiaries is subject to intense competition changes in consumer preferences and local economic conditions to be successful they must continue 

   the willingness of consumers to purchase premium cigarette brands and premium food and beverage brands depends in part on local economic conditions in periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label and other economy brands and the volume of our consumer products subsidiaries could suffer accordingly 

  our finance subsidiary pmcc invests in finance leases principally in transportation power generation and manufacturing equipment and facilities its lessees are also subject to intense competition and economic conditions if counterparties to pmccs leases fail to manage through difficult economic and competitive conditions pmcc may have to increase its allowance for losses which would adversely affect our profitability 

  grocery trade consolidation  as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers grow larger and become more sophisticated they demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs further these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on private label products if kraft fails to use its scale marketing expertise branded products and category 

  leadership positions to respond to these trends its volume growth could slow or it may need to lower prices or increase promotional support of its products any of which would adversely affect profitability 

  continued need to add food and beverage products in faster growing and more profitable categories  the food and beverage industrys growth potential is constrained by population growth krafts success depends in part on its ability to grow its business faster than populations are growing in the markets that it serves one way to achieve that growth is to enhance its portfolio by adding products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories if kraft does not succeed in making these enhancements its volume growth may slow which would adversely affect our profitability 

  strengthening brand portfolios through acquisitions and divestitures  one element of the growth strategies of kraft and pmi is to strengthen their brand portfolios through active programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures these subsidiaries are constantly investigating potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sell businesses that are outside their core categories or that do not meet their growth or profitability targets acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that all future acquisitions will be quickly accretive to earnings 

  raw material prices  the raw materials used by our consumer products subsidiaries are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging cost and our operating subsidiaries may be unable to increase their prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume net revenue and operating companies income we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging procedures may not work as planned 

  food safety and quality concerns  we could be adversely affected if consumers in krafts principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products adverse publicity about these types of concerns like the recent publicity about genetically modified organisms and mad cow disease in europe whether or not valid may discourage consumers from buying krafts products or cause production and delivery disruptions in addition kraft may need to recall some of its products if they become adulterated or misbranded kraft may also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes injury a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause products to be unavailable for a period of time and a loss of consumer confidence in krafts food products and could have a material adverse effect on krafts business

   with respect to certain adverse verdicts currently on appeal excluding amounts relating to the engle case pm usa has posted various forms of security totaling 324 million to obtain stays of judgments pending appeals 

    in addition since january 1999 jury verdicts have been returned in 13 tobaccorelated cases in which neither alg nor any of its subsidiaries were defendants verdicts in favor of defendants were returned in eight of the 13 cases in cases tried in connecticut texas south carolina mississippi louisiana missouri and tennessee 2 plaintiffs appeal is pending in mississippi verdicts in favor of plaintiffs were returned in 5 of the 13 cases in cases tried in australia kansas florida 2 and puerto rico defendants appeals or posttrial motions are pending in december 2002 the appellate court reversed the ruling in favor of plaintiff in the case in australia in october 2002 the court granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law in the case in puerto rico and entered judgment in favor of defendant in addition in a case in france the trial court found in favor of plaintiff however the appellate court reversed the trial courts ruling and dismissed plaintiffs claim 

engle class action 

  verdicts have been returned and judgment has been entered against pm usa and other defendants in the first two phases of this threephase smoking and health class action trial in florida the class consists of all florida residents and citizens and their survivors who have suffered presently suffer or have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine 

  in july 1999 the jury returned a verdict against defendants in phase one of the trial concerning certain issues determined by the trial court to be common to the causes of action of the plaintiff class among other things the jury found that smoking cigarettes causes 20 diseases or medical conditions that cigarettes are addictive or dependenceproducing defective and unreasonably dangerous that defendants made materially false statements with the intention of misleading smokers that defendants concealed or omitted material information concerning the health effects andor the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes and that defendants were negligent and engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct or acted with reckless disregard with the intent to inflict emotional distress 

  during phase two of the trial the claims of three of the named plaintiffs were adjudicated in a consolidated trial before the same jury that returned the verdict in phase one in april 2000 the jury determined liability against the defendants and awarded 127 million in compensatory damages to the three named plaintiffs 

  in july 2000 the same jury returned a verdict assessing punitive damages on a lump sum basis for the entire class totaling approximately 145 billion against the various defendants in the case including approximately 74 billion severally against pm usa pm usa believes that the punitive damages award was determined improperly and that it should ultimately be set aside on any one of numerous grounds included among these grounds are the following under applicable law i defendants are entitled to have liability and damages for each plaintiff tried by the same jury an impossibility due to the jurys dismissal ii punitive damages cannot be assessed before the jury determines entitlement to and the amount of compensatory damages for all class members iii punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages a determination that cannot be made before compensatory damages are assessed for all class members and iv punitive damages can punish but cannot destroy the defendant in march 2000 at the request of the florida legislature the attorney general of florida issued an advisory legal opinion stating that florida law is clear that compensatory damages must be determined prior to an award of punitive damages in cases such as engle  as noted above compensatory damages for all but three members of the class have not been determined 

  following the verdict in the second phase of the trial the jury was dismissed notwithstanding that liability and compensatory damages for all but three class members have not yet been determined according to the trial plan phase three of the trial will address other class members claims including issues of specific causation reliance affirmative defenses and other individualspecific issues regarding entitlement to damages in individual trials before separate juries 

  it is unclear how the trial plan will be further implemented the trial plan provides that the punitive damages award should be standard as to each class member and acknowledges that the actual size of the class will not be known until the last class members case has withstood appeal ie the punitive damages amount would be divided equally among those plaintiffs who in addition to the successful phase two plaintiffs are ultimately successful in phase three of the trial and in any appeal 

    following the jurys punitive damages verdict in july 2000 defendants removed the case to federal district court following the intervention application of a union health fund that raised federal issues in the case in november 2000 the federal district court remanded the case to state court on the grounds that the removal was premature 

  the trial judge in the state court without a hearing then immediately denied the defendants posttrial motions and entered judgment on the compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury pm usa and alg believe that the entry of judgment by the trial court is unconstitutional and violates florida law pm usa has filed an appeal with respect to the entry of judgment class certification and numerous other reversible errors that have occurred during the trial pm usa has also posted a 100 million bond to stay execution of the judgment with respect to the 74 billion in punitive damages that has been awarded against it the bond was posted pursuant to legislation that was enacted in florida in may 2000 that limits the size of the bond that must be posted in order to stay execution of a judgment for punitive damages in a certified class action to no more than 100 million regardless of the amount of punitive damages bond cap legislation 

  plaintiffs had previously indicated that they believe the bond cap legislation is unconstitutional and might seek to challenge the 100 million bond if the bond were found to be invalid it would be commercially impossible for pm usa to post a bond in the full amount of the judgment and absent appellate relief pm usa would not be able to stay any attempted execution of the judgment in florida pm usa and alg will take all appropriate steps to seek to prevent this worstcase scenario from occurring in may 2001 the trial court approved a stipulation the stipulation among pm usa certain other defendants plaintiffs and the plaintiff class that provides that execution or enforcement of the punitive damages component of the engle judgment will remain stayed against pm usa and the other participating defendants through the completion of all judicial review as a result of the stipulation and in addition to the 100 million bond it previously posted pm usa placed 12 billion into an interestbearing escrow account for the benefit of the engle class should pm usa prevail in its appeal of the case both amounts are to be returned to pm usa pm usa also placed an additional 500 million into a separate interestbearing escrow account for the benefit of the engle class if pm usa prevails in its appeal this amount will be paid to the court and the court will determine how to allocate or distribute it consistent with the florida rules of civil procedure in connection with the stipulation alg recorded a 500 million pretax charge in its consolidated statement of earnings for the quarter ended march 31 2001 

  pm usa and alg remain of the view that the engle case should not have been certified as a class action the certification is inconsistent with the overwhelming majority of federal and state court decisions that have held that mass smoking and health claims are inappropriate for class treatment pm usa has filed an appeal challenging the class certification and the compensatory and punitive damages awards as well as numerous other reversible errors that it believes occurred during the trial to date the appellate court heard oral argument on defendants appeals in november 2002

health care cost recovery litigation 

overview 

  in certain pending proceedings domestic and foreign governmental entities and nongovernmental plaintiffs including union health and welfare funds unions native american tribes insurers and selfinsurers such as blue cross and blue shield plans hospitals taxpayers and others are seeking reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and in some cases of future expenditures and damages as well relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors disclosure of research disgorgement of profits funding of antismoking programs additional disclosure of nicotine yields and payment of attorney and expert witness fees certain of the health care cost recovery cases purport to be brought on behalf of a class of plaintiffs 

  the claims asserted in the health care cost recovery actions include the equitable claim that the tobacco industry was unjustly enriched by plaintiffs payment of health care costs allegedly attributable to smoking the equitable claim of indemnity common law claims of negligence strict liability breach of express and implied warranty violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty fraud negligent misrepresentation conspiracy public nuisance claims under federal and state statutes governing consumer fraud antitrust deceptive trade practices and false advertising and claims under federal and state rico statutes 

  defenses raised include lack of proximate cause remoteness of injury failure to state a valid claim lack of benefit adequate remedy at law unclean hands namely that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in and benefited from the sale of cigarettes lack of antitrust standing and injury federal preemption lack of statutory authority to bring suit and statutes of limitations in addition defendants argue that they should be entitled to set off any alleged damages to the extent the plaintiff benefits economically from the sale of cigarettes through the receipt of excise taxes or otherwise defendants also argue that these cases are improper because plaintiffs must proceed under principles of subrogation and assignment under traditional theories of recovery a payor of medical costs such as an insurer can seek recovery of health care costs from a third party solely by standing in the shoes of the injured party defendants argue that plaintiffs should be required to bring any actions as subrogees of individual health care recipients and should be subject to all defenses available against the injured party 

  exhibit 991 hereto lists the health care cost recovery cases pending as of february 14 2003 and discusses developments in such cases since november 13 2002 

    although there have been some decisions to the contrary most courts that have decided motions in these cases have dismissed all or most of the claims against the industry in addition eight federal circuit courts of appeals the second third fifth seventh eighth ninth eleventh and district of columbia circuits as well as california florida new york and tennessee intermediate appellate courts relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs claims were too remote have affirmed dismissals of or reversed trial courts that had refused to dismiss health care cost recovery actions the united states supreme court has refused to consider plaintiffs appeals from the cases decided by the courts of appeals for the second third fifth ninth and district of columbia circuits as of february 14 2003 there were an estimated 41 health care cost recovery cases pending in the united states against pm usa and in some instances alg including the case filed by the united states government which is discussed below under  federal governments lawsuit  the cases brought in the united states include actions brought by belize bolivia ecuador guatemala honduras nicaragua the province of ontario canada panama the russian federation tajikistan ukraine venezuela 11 brazilian states and 11 brazilian cities the actions brought by belize bolivia ecuador guatemala honduras nicaragua the province of ontario panama the russian federation tajikistan ukraine venezuela 10 brazilian states and 11 brazilian cities were consolidated for pretrial purposes and transferred to the united states district court for the district of columbia the district court dismissed the cases brought by guatemala nicaragua ukraine and the province of ontario and the dismissals are now final the district court has remanded to state courts the remaining cases except for the cases brought by bolivia and panama subsequent to remand the ecuador case was voluntarily dismissed in november 2001 the cases brought by venezuela and the brazilian state of espirito santo were dismissed by the state court and venezuela appealed in september 2002 the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the case brought by venezuela and venezuela has petitioned the state supreme court for further review in addition to cases brought in the united states health care cost recovery actions have also been brought in israel the marshall islands dismissed the province of british columbia canada france and spain dismissed for lack of jurisdiction appeal pending and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions 

  in march 1999 in the first health care cost recovery case to go to trial an ohio jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on all counts in june 2001 a new york jury returned a verdict awarding 683 million in compensatory damages against pm usa and a total of 11 million against four other defendants in a health care cost recovery action brought by a blue cross and blue shield plan in february 2002 the court awarded plaintiff approximately 38 million for attorneys fees defendants including pm usa have appealed 

settlements of health care cost recovery litigation 

  in november 1998 pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the msa with 46 states the district of columbia puerto rico guam the united states virgin islands american samoa and the northern marianas to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims pm usa and certain other united states tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi florida texas and minnesota together with the msa the state settlement agreements the msa has received final judicial approval in all 52 settling jurisdictions the state settlement agreements require that the domestic tobacco industry make substantial annual payments in the following amounts excluding future annual payments contemplated by the agreement with tobacco growers discussed below subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation market share and industry volume 2003 109 billion 2004 through 2007 84 billion each year and thereafter 94 billion each year in addition the domestic tobacco industry is required to pay settling plaintiffs attorneys fees subject to an annual cap of 500 million as well as additional annual payments of 250 million through 2003 these payment obligations are the several and not joint obligations of each settling defendant pm usas portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments including rollyourown cigarettes in the year preceding that in which the payment is due pm usa records its portions of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped 

    the state settlement agreements also include provisions relating to advertising and marketing restrictions public disclosure of certain industry documents limitations on challenges to certain tobacco control and underage use laws restrictions on lobbying activities and other provisions 

  as part of the msa the settling defendants committed to work cooperatively with the tobaccogrowing states to address concerns about the potential adverse economic impact of the msa on tobacco growers and quotaholders to that end four of the major domestic tobacco product manufacturers including pm usa and the grower states have established a trust fund to provide aid to tobacco growers and quotaholders the trust will be funded by these four manufacturers over 12 years with payments prior to application of various adjustments scheduled to total 515 billion future industry payments 2003 through 2008 500 million each year 2009 and 2010 295 million each year are subject to adjustment for several factors including inflation united states cigarette volume and certain other contingent events and in general are to be allocated based on each manufacturers relative market share pm usa records its portion of these payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped 

  the state settlement agreements have materially adversely affected the volumes of pm usa and may adversely affect future volumes alg believes that they may also materially adversely affect the results of operations cash flows or financial position of pm usa and altria group inc in future periods the degree of the adverse impact will depend among other things on the rate of decline in united states cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments pm usas share of the domestic premium and discount cigarette segments and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the msa and the other state settlement agreements 

  certain litigation described in exhibit 991 has arisen challenging the validity of the msa and alleging violations of antitrust laws

  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against alg and its subsidiaries litigation is subject to many uncertainties as discussed above under recent trial results unfavorable verdicts awarding substantial damages against pm usa have been returned in 11 cases in recent years and these cases are in various posttrial stages it is possible that there could be further adverse developments in these cases and that additional cases could be decided unfavorably in the event of an adverse trial result in certain pending litigation the defendant may not be able to obtain a required bond or obtain relief from bonding requirements in order to prevent a plaintiff from seeking to collect a judgment while an adverse verdict is being appealed an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation there have also been a number of adverse legislative regulatory political and 

  other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry that have received widespread media attention these developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation 

  alg and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated except as discussed elsewhere in this item 3 legal proceedings i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated litigation ii management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobaccorelated litigation and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes if any 

  the present legislative and litigation environment is substantially uncertain and it is possible that the business and volume of algs subsidiaries as well as altria group incs consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation or by the enactment of federal or state tobacco legislation alg and each of its subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that it has a number of valid defenses to the litigation pending against it as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against it all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however alg and its subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if they believe it is in the best interests of algs stockholders to do so
