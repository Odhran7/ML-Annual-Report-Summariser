the fees we charge for services in these two business units are generally on a per transaction basis we have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the database because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to the work number ® database and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to thirdparty employment verification requests while providing them with the assurance that the process is automated and not subject to human interpretation the work number ® database held over 535 million current and historic employment records at december 31 2021

state laws and regulations relating to consumer and data protection 

  

• a number of states have enacted requirements similar to the federal fcra some of these state laws impose additional or more stringent requirements than the fcra especially in connection with investigations and responses to reported inaccuracies in consumer reports the fcra preempts some of these state laws but the scope of preemption continues to be defined by the courts the state of vermont is grandfathered under the original fcra requirements and thus we are subject to additional requirements to comply with vermont law 

• all fifty states have adopted versions of data security breach laws that require notification to affected consumers and potentially regulators or law enforcement authorities in the event of a breach of personal information a subset of these laws and other state laws require the implementation of data security measures as well state attorneys general can enforce such state laws and can seek equitable as well as monetary remedies and in some cases private rights of action are permitted by such laws

• state banking and financial services regulatory agencies have asserted either express or implied authority under applicable state laws to examine us as a thirdparty service provider to financial institutions and in certain cases to bring enforcement actions against us generally such examinations and related enforcement actions are focused on assessing our safety and soundness in support of financial institutions we serve in 2018 we entered into a consent order with certain state banking regulators in response to their multistate review of our information security program this consent order obligated us to among other things make certain changes to our corporate governance and information security practices

technology and data security risks 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could compromise company consumer and customer information interfere with our operations cause us to incur significant costs for remediation and enhancement of our it systems and expose us to legal liability all of which could have a substantial negative impact on our business and reputation 

we are a global data analytics and technology company in the ordinary course of business we collect process transmit and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of consumers employees and strategic partners the secure operation of our information technology networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy because our products and services involve the storage and transmission of personal information of consumers we are routinely the target of attempted cyber and other security threats by outside third parties including technically sophisticated and wellresourced bad actors attempting to access or steal the data we store additionally we could experience service disruptions or a loss of access to critical data or systems due to ransomware or other destructive attacks insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern for all companies including ours despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training and contractual precautions our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access to data loss of access to systems or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct attacks by hackers employee or insider malfeasance andor human error 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and often are not recognized until launched against a target or even some time after we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis even if our security measures are appropriate reasonable andor comply with applicable legal requirements certain efforts may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect further we are in the process of transforming our applications and infrastructure technologies and this transition to cloudbased technologies may expose us to additional cyber threats as we migrate our data from our legacy systems to cloudbased solutions hosted by third parties although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections these security measures cannot provide absolute security 

in 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers if we experience additional significant breaches of our security measures including from incidents that we fail to detect for a period of time sensitive data may be accessed stolen disclosed or lost any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to significant litigation regulatory fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations we cannot ensure that our insurance policies in the future will be adequate to cover losses from any security breaches 

security breaches and attacks and the adverse publicity that may follow can have a negative impact on our reputation and our relationship with our customers for example our reputation with consumers and other stakeholders and our customer relationships were damaged following the 2017 cybersecurity incident resulting in a negative impact on our revenue for a period of time if we experience another material cybersecurity incident or are otherwise unable to demonstrate the security of our systems and the data we maintain and retain the trust of our customers consumers and data suppliers we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business 

if we fail to achieve and maintain key industry or technical certifications our customers and business partners may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business which would negatively affect our revenue 

we are required by customers and business partners to obtain various industry or technical certifications such certifications are critical to our business because certain of our current and potential customers and the contracts governing certain customer relationships as well as certain of our data suppliers require us to maintain them as a requirement of doing business for example as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we lost certain key certifications which caused certain customers and business partners to stop or pause doing business with us and temporarily limited our ability to win new business we had to spend significant resources on remediation activities in order to obtain these key recertifications if we fail to achieve or maintain key industry or technical certifications as a result of another cybersecurity incident or for other reasons customers and business partners may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business which would negatively affect our revenue 

strategy and market demand risks 

our business has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks including the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts by governments to attempt to control its spread have adversely impacted the global economy leading to reduced consumer spending and lending activities our customers and therefore our business and revenues are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions we experienced significant revenue declines in several of our markets as a result of covid19 we expect that the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our operating revenue will continue until health and economic conditions improve 

we continue to work with our stakeholders including customers employees consumers suppliers business partners and local communities to responsibly address this global pandemic we will continue to monitor the situation and assess possible implications to our business and our stakeholders and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences we cannot assure you that we will be successful in any such mitigation efforts the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration of the pandemic the emergence of new virus variants new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the covid19 pandemic outbreaks occurring at any of our facilities the actions taken to control the spread of covid19 or treat its impact and changes in worldwide and us economic conditions further deteriorations in economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could lead to a further or prolonged decline in demand for our products and services and negatively impact our business it may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing or the terms of any such financing we cannot at this time predict the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic and its resulting economic impact but it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k such as our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to protect our information technology networks and infrastructure from unauthorized access misuse malware phishing and other events that could have a security impact as a result of our remote working environment or otherwise 

the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our technology transformation strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results 

we expect our technology transformation strategy including our transition to cloudbased technologies will significantly increase our efficiency our productivity and the stability and functionality of our products and services as well as decrease the cost of our overall systems infrastructure all of which we expect will drive growth and have a positive effect on our business competitive position and results of operations this initiative is a major undertaking as we replace many of our previous operating systems with cloudbased systems this complex multifaceted and extensive initiative is expensive and may cause material unanticipated problems and expenses if the transition causes errors or adversely impacts system processes our new systems do not operate as expected or the data we transition to the cloud changes in a material way we may have to incur significant additional costs to make modifications and could lose customers and we may suffer reputational harm as a result moreover we may experience issues with customer migration as many of our customers may not migrate to cloudbased technologies on a timely basis or at all or may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloudbased technologies which could negatively impact our revenue 

we cannot assure you that our technology transformation strategy will be beneficial to the extent or within the timeframes expected or that the estimated efficiency cost savings and other improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all market acceptance of cloudbased offerings is affected by a variety of factors including information security reliability performance the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies customer and data provider concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data as well as the customer’s ability to access this data once a contract has expired and consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers if we are unable to correctly respond to these issues we may experience business disruptions damage to our reputation negative publicity diminished customer trust and relationships and other adverse effects on our business even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized there may be consequences internal control issues or business impacts that were not expected our transition and migration to cloudbased technologies may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical legal or other costs 

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers licensors furnishers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number ® and telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange for a variety of reasons including concerns of data furnishers arising out of legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use security breaches or competitive reasons our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection disclosure or use of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our customers could be adversely affected which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share and reputational loss there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

negative changes in general economic conditions including interest rates the level of inflation unemployment rates income home prices investment values and consumer confidence could adversely affect us 

our customers and therefore our business and revenues are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions including the demand and availability of affordable credit and capital the level and volatility of interest rates the level of inflation employment levels consumer confidence and housing demand both inside and outside the united states business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity which can be impacted by changes in interest rates and the level of inflation banks’ and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit are adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth 

our customer base suffers when financial markets experience volatility illiquidity and disruption and the potential for increased and continuing disruptions going forward presents considerable risks to our business and revenue high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for many of our products and services and consequently our revenue and results of operations as consumers may postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

in 2022 we expect us mortgage market inquiries to decline by more than 20 percent compared to 2021 any change in the us mortgage market due to a significant change in mortgage inquiries could have a corresponding negative impact on revenue and operating profit for our business primarily within the workforce solutions and usis operating segments to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect our financial position and profitability 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our revenue and operating margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services new competitors may choose to enter and compete in our markets or existing competitors may choose to introduce new products and enter markets that we serve and that they do not currently serve the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services or some of our customers may develop products of their own that replace the products they currently purchase from us which would result in lower revenue in addition many of our competitors have extensive consumer relationships including relationships with our current and potential customers moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the us mortgage market changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single or dual bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

some of our competitors may choose to sell products that compete with ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as a part of integrated suites given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

if our relationships with key customers are materially diminished or terminated our business could suffer 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time many of our material customer agreements can be terminated by the customer for convenience on advance written notice which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to award more business to our competitors there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers or business partners on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers or business partners the loss of one or more of our major customers or business partners could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner or if the market does not adopt our new services or if new technologies are introduced by competitors that are more effective or at lower costs than ours our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes including the introduction of new innovative technologies frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new technologies products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process our resources have to be committed to any new products and services before knowing whether the market will adopt the new offerings 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue in addition governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services recently there also has been an increase in companies offering free or lowcost directtoconsumer credit services such as credit scores reports and monitoring as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to other products and services to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we rely in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial or operating results or it and data security profile we expect in addition if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances our growth may be adversely impacted 

historically we have relied in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business any acquisitions we do complete may not be on favorable terms may involve greaterthanexpected liabilities and expenses potential impairments of tangible and intangible assets or significant writeoffs and the expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies it systems and personnel into our operations it and data security profiles of acquired companies may not meet our technological standards and may take longer to integrate and remediate than planned this may result in significantly greater transaction remediation and integration costs for future acquisitions than we have experienced historically or it could mean that we will not pursue certain acquisitions where the costs of integration and remediation are too significant we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in geographies and markets or market segments where we do not currently have a significant presence and acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside of the us will increase our exposure to risks of conducting operations in international markets these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

despite our past experience opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances may not be available to us in the future in addition our focus on data security and our technology transformation strategy including our migration to cloudbased technologies may limit our ability to identify and complete acquisitions as our stringent technological criteria and standards for acquisition candidates may continue to increase 

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us federal state and local governments and their respective agencies we also derive a portion of our revenue from sales to foreign governments and related agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting a number of our federal government contracts have received enhanced scrutiny and media attention due to the sensitive nature of the data we handle and due to the importance of the government programs we support if we experience another material cybersecurity incident if public scrutiny and pressure related to government services we support turns negative or if we experience uptime issues or performance problems our ability to maintain existing or acquire new government contracts may be substantially impacted 

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work if the services we provide are no longer needed due to government program change or termination or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected including by our failure to achieve certain government certifications our business could suffer 

operational risks 

our technology transformation strategy places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other limited resources 

as part of our technology transformation strategy we are transitioning and migrating our data systems from traditional on premises data centers to cloudbased platforms this initiative places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources internal financial controls and reporting function in addition many of our existing personnel have limited experience with native cloudbased technologies this effort has been and will continue to be time consuming and costly our technology transformation strategy requires management time and resources to educate employees and implement new ways of conducting business the dedication of resources to our technology transformation strategy and cloudbased technologies limits the resources we have available to devote to other initiatives or growth opportunities or to invest in the maintenance of our existing internal systems we cannot guarantee that our strategy is the right one or that investments in alternative technologies or other initiatives would not be a better use of our limited resources 

additionally as a result of our cloud migration efforts in connection with our technology transformation strategy we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods reorganization and transition can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transition to cloudbased technologies could expose us to operational disruptions 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are managed internally within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties as part of our technology transformation strategy we are upgrading a significant portion of the information technology systems used to operate our business and replacing them with cloudbased solutions this transition will continue to require substantial changes to our software and network infrastructure which could lead to system interruptions affect our data systems and further expose us to operational disruptions and cause us to lose customers all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

upon implementation of the new cloudbased solutions much of our information technology systems will consist of outsourced cloudbased infrastructure platform and softwareasaservice solutions not under our direct management or control any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our customers we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 

if our systems do not meet customer requirements for response time or high availability or we experience system constraints or failures or our customers do not migrate to the cloud or modify andor upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins service level penalties or other harm to our business and reputation 

our customers expect high system availability and response time performance as well as a very high degree of system resilience we depend on reliable stable efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network systems and data centers to provide service to our customers many of the services and systems upon which we rely have been outsourced to third parties in addition many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers these systems and operations and the personnel that support service and operate these systems could be exposed to interruption damage or destruction from power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses denialofservice or other cyber attacks employee or insider malfeasance human error fire natural disasters war terrorist acts or civil unrest we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner which may be exacerbated by any delays in obtaining equipment due to supply chain or other impacts 

in addition as part of our technology transformation we are seeking to migrate our customers from traditional data platforms to cloudbased products and services many of our customers may not migrate to cloudbased technologies on a timely basis or at all or may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloudbased 

technologies if our customers’ timelines prevent them from migrating to cloudbased technologies quickly enough they will remain on our legacy infrastructure which could expose them to system availability response time and performance issues 

any significant system interruption or series of minor interruptions could result in the loss of customers andor lost revenues lower margins service level penalties or other significant harm to our business or reputation 

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our technology transformation we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels including with respect to data and system security or increase prices for their services to unreasonable levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unrealized efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition some of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success including our ability to implement our technology transformation strategy depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations such as it and data security which require specialized skills such as migrating legacy computer systems to the cloud data security expertise and analytical modeling additionally the worker shortage that emerged following the outbreak of covid19 has presented increased challenges to our ability to develop retain and attract qualified personnel if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business as part of our technology transformation strategy we have hired or contracted with a significant number of new employees and contract workers hiring onboarding training motivating retaining and managing employees with the skills required is timeconsuming and expensive there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees if we are not able to hire sufficient employees to support our technology transformation or to train motivate retain and manage the employees we do hire it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

global operational risks 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales outside the us comprised 22 of our total revenue in 2021 as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally and these risks may differ in each jurisdiction we operate depending on the particular product or service we offer in the jurisdiction in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions 

• trade protection measures 

• data privacy and consumer protection laws and regulations 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations 

• business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions 

• difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner 

• implementation of exchange controls 

• geopolitical instability including terrorism and war including the evolving situation involving ukraine and russia 

• foreign currency changes 

• increased travel infrastructure legal and compliance costs of multiple international locations 

• foreign laws and regulatory requirements 

• terrorist activity natural disasters pandemics and other catastrophic events 

• restrictions on the import and export of technologies 

• difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable 

• longer payment cycles 

• failure to meet quality standards for outsourced work 

• unfavorable tax rules 

• the presence and acceptance of varying level of business corruption in international markets and 

• varying business practices in foreign countries 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the argentine peso the chilean peso the euro the new zealand dollar the costa rican colon the singapore dollar the brazilian real the russian ruble and the indian rupee because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against major currencies will affect our operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

legal and regulatory risks 

as part of a global settlement we entered into agreements with various parties to settle the us consumer mdl litigation and certain federal and state government investigations arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident if we are unable to comply with our obligations under these agreements it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in july 2019 the company entered into multiple agreements that resolve the us consolidated consumer class action cases captioned in re equifax inc customer data security breach litigation mdl no 2800 consumer cases the “us consumer mdl litigation” and the investigations of the ftc the cfpb the attorneys general of 48 states the district of columbia and puerto rico the “msag group” and the nydfs collectively the “consumer settlement” relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident on january 13 2020 the us district court for the northern district of georgia the “mdl court” entered an order granting final approval of the settlement in connection with the us consumer mdl litigation from which several objectors appealed those appeals have all been resolved on january 11 2022 the consumer settlement became effective which triggered our obligation to deposit approximately 345 million into the consumer settlement fund 

in addition to the monetary payments and consumer redress we also agreed as part of the consumer settlement to implement certain business practice commitments related to consumer assistance and our information security program including third party assessments of our program these business practice commitments are extensive and require a significant amount of attention from management to the extent we are unable to comply or we are viewed as not being in compliance with these business practice commitments or other requirements of a relevant order we could face an enforcement action or contempt proceeding that could potentially result in fines penalties and new business practice commitments which depending on the amount and type could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in addition we may be required to deposit additional amounts in the consumer settlement fund under certain circumstances if the fund is insufficient to cover claims and certain expenses while we do not believe that we will be required to deposit additional amounts into the consumer settlement fund based on our claims experience to date we could be obligated to fund up to an additional 125 million if our claims experience changes and the consumer fund is exhausted 

we and our customers are subject to various current laws and governmental regulations and could be affected by new and evolving consumer privacy and cybersecurity or other datarelated laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain laws and regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy cybersecurity data and financial protection see “item 1 business—governmental regulation” in this form 10k for a summary of the us and foreign consumer and data protection laws and regulations to which we are subject these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business in addition new laws and regulations at the state and federal level are enacted or considered frequently examples of such new and evolving laws and regulations include amendments to the fcra requiring the provision of free credit freezes to consumers cybersecurity and other requirements promulgated by the new york department of financial services the ccpa which took effect on january 1 2020 the california data broker registration requirements that took effect on january 31 2020 and the cpra and vcdpa each taking effect on january 1 2023 furthermore we expect there to be an increased focus on laws and regulations related to our business including by the current us presidential administration and the us congress because of the growing policy concerns in the us with regard to the operation of credit reporting agencies as well as the collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information 

there are a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy or cybersecurity that could affect us the canadian government has initiated a review of consumer privacy laws and several us states have introduced varying comprehensive privacy laws modeled to some degree on the ccpa andor the gdpr compliance with multiple state laws containing varying requirements could be complicated and costly in europe although the gdpr already includes certain provisions relating to the automated processing of personal data there has also been discussion of new legislative proposals to regulate business use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies which if enacted could impose new legal requirements addressing among other issues privacy discrimination and human rights the specifics of such legislation and the number of jurisdictions that will introduce legislation in this area remain unclear at this time in addition a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed or acquired by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use access accuracy and security of such data are possible in the us state laws provide for disparate notification regimes all of which we are subject to further any perception that our practices or products are an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism private class actions reputational harm or claims by regulators which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability 

we devote substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to strive for compliance with applicable regulations and requirements in the future we may be subject to significant additional expenses related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations including new laws and evolving interpretations that are difficult to predict and to investigate defend or remedy actual or alleged violations additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state federal and foreign government examinations of or inquiries into our business practices the enactment of new laws and how they are interpreted could impact our business in particular legislative activity in the privacy area may result in new laws that are applicable to us and that may hinder our business for example by restricting use or sharing of consumer data including for marketing or advertising or limiting the use of or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence and machine learning including the use of algorithms and automated processing in ways that could materially affect our business or which may lead to significant increases in the cost of compliance any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in new costs for our operations the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation restrictions on the operation of our business and reputational harm it is difficult to predict the impact on our business if we were subject to allegations of having violated existing laws for example in europe the gdpr which includes extensive regulations for certain security incidents could result in fines of up to four percent of annual worldwide “turnover” a measure similar to revenues in the us in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products moreover our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation depend in part on customers’ adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with consumer expectations and regulatory requirements we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• amendment enactment or interpretation of laws and regulations that restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions or the supply of data available to customers 

• changes in cultural and consumer attitudes in favor of further restrictions on information collection and sharing which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions 

• failure of data suppliers or customers to comply with laws or regulations where mutual compliance is required 

• failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations and 

• failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient cost effective manner 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise adversely affect our business 

the cfpb has supervisory and examination authority over our business and may initiate enforcement actions with regard to our compliance with federal consumer financial laws 

the cfpb which was established under the doddfrank act and commenced operations in july 2011 has broad authority over our business this includes authority to issue regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws such as under fcra and other laws applicable to us and our financial customers the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority 

in 2012 credit reporting companies like us became subject to a federal supervision program for the first time under the cfpb’s authority to supervise and examine certain nondepository institutions that are “larger participants” of the consumer credit reporting market the cfpb conducts examinations and investigations and may issue subpoenas and bring civil actions in federal court for violations of the federal consumer financial laws including fcra in these proceedings the cfpb can seek relief that includes rescission or reformation of contracts restitution disgorgement of profits payment of damages limits on activities and civil money penalties of up to 10 million per day for known violations the cfpb conducts periodic examinations of us and the consumer credit reporting industry which could result in new regulations or enforcement actions or proceedings actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them 

although we have committed resources to enhancing our compliance programs actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us could result in reputational harm our compliance costs and legal and regulatory exposure could increase materially if the cfpb or other regulators enact new regulations change regulations that were previously adopted modify through supervision or enforcement past regulatory guidance or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than have been previously interpreted 

regulatory oversight of our contractual relationships with certain of our customers may adversely affect our business 

the federal banking agencies including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the cfpb as well as many state banking agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships this guidance requires more rigorous oversight of thirdparty relationships that involve certain “critical activities” in light of this guidance our existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance may continue to revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with us which may adversely affect our relationships with such customers andor increase our expenses in servicing such customers 

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision that provides an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits both individual and class action against us alleging a violation of the fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years 

third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

there has been substantial litigation in the us regarding intellectual property rights in the information technology industry from time to time third parties may make claims that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to each such claim on a case by case basis a dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property can be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the inherent uncertainty of intellectual property litigation could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations and we may not prevail a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or providing commercial leverage for negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all although our policy is to obtain licenses or other rights where necessary we cannot provide assurance that we have obtained all required licenses or rights 

third parties may misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as contract restrictions confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to devote significant resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect misappropriation or infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect misappropriation or infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because a third party has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

financial market risks 

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and postretirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

litigation and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident   

in 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers following the 2017 cybersecurity incident hundreds of class actions and other lawsuits were filed against us typically alleging harm from the incident and seeking various remedies including monetary and injunctive relief we were also subject to investigations and inquiries by federal state and foreign governmental agencies and officials regarding the 2017 cybersecurity incident and related matters most of these lawsuits and government investigations have concluded or been resolved including pursuant to the settlement agreements described below while others remain ongoing the company’s participation in these settlements does not constitute an admission by the company of any fault or liability and the company does not admit fault or liability 

consumer settlement 

on july 19 2019 and july 22 2019 we entered into multiple agreements that resolve the us consolidated consumer class action cases captioned in re equifax inc customer data security breach litigation mdl no 2800 the “us consumer mdl litigation” and the investigations of the ftc the cfpb the attorneys general of 48 states the district of columbia and puerto rico and the nydfs collectively the “consumer settlement” under the terms of the consumer settlement the company agreed to contribute 3805 million to a nonreversionary settlement fund the “consumer restitution fund” to provide restitution for us consumers identified by the company whose personal information was compromised as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident as well as to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs and expenses for the plaintiffs’ counsel in the us consumer mdl litigation not to exceed 805 million settlement administration costs and notice costs the company has agreed to contribute up to an additional 1250 million to the consumer restitution fund to cover certain unreimbursed costs and expenditures incurred by affected us consumers in the event the 3805 million in the consumer restitution fund is exhausted the company also agreed to various business practice commitments related to consumer assistance and its information security program including conducting third party assessments of its information security program 

on january 13 2020 the northern district of georgia the us district court overseeing centralized pretrial proceedings for the us consumer mdl litigation and numerous other federal court actions relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the “mdl court” entered an order granting final approval of the settlement in connection with the us consumer mdl litigation the mdl court entered an amended order granting final approval of the settlement the “final approval order” on march 17 2020 several objectors appealed the final approval order to the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit the “eleventh circuit” on june 3 2021 the eleventh circuit issued an order reversing the mdl court’s grant of incentive awards to class representatives but affirming all other aspects of the final approval order several objectors filed petitions with the eleventh circuit seeking a rehearing and on july 29 2021 the eleventh circuit denied those petitions on august 12 2021 the mdl court made the eleventh circuit’s mandate the judgment of the mdl court two objectors filed petitions for a writ of certiorari with the us supreme court and on january 10 2022 the us supreme court denied the last remaining petition on january 11 2022 the consumer settlement became effective 

other matters 

we face other lawsuits and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident that have not yet been concluded or resolved these ongoing matters may result in judgments fines or penalties settlements or other relief we dispute the allegations in the remaining lawsuits and intend to defend against such claims set forth below are descriptions of the main categories of these matters 

georgia state court consumer class actions four putative class actions arising from the 2017 cybersecurity incident were filed against us in fulton county superior court and fulton county state court in georgia based on similar allegations and theories as alleged in the us consumer mdl litigation and seek monetary damages injunctive relief and other related relief on behalf of georgia citizens these cases were transferred to a single judge in the fulton county business court and three of the cases were consolidated into a single action on july 27 2018 the fulton county business court granted the company’s motion to stay the remaining single case and on august 17 2018 the fulton county business court granted the company’s motion to stay the consolidated case because the plaintiffs in the four putative class actions did not opt out of the consumer settlement that became effective on january 11 2022 these cases have been dismissed and are now closed 

canadian class actions five putative canadian class actions four of which are on behalf of a national class of approximately 19000 canadian consumers are pending against us in ontario british columbia and alberta each of the 

proposed canadian class actions asserts a number of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and other related relief in connection with the 2017 cybersecurity incident in addition to seeking class certification on behalf of canadian consumers whose personal information was allegedly impacted by the 2017 cybersecurity incident in some cases plaintiffs also seek class certification on behalf of a larger group of canadian consumers who had contracts for subscription products with equifax around the time of the incident or earlier and were not impacted by the incident 

on december 13 2019 the court in ontario granted certification of a nationwide class that includes all impacted canadians as well as canadians who had subscription products with equifax between march 7 2017 and july 30 2017 who were not impacted by the incident we appealed one of the claims on which a class was certified and on june 9 2021 our appeal was granted by the ontario divisional court the plaintiff has since filed a notice of further appeal with the ontario court of appeal which is scheduled to be heard in june 2022 all remaining purported class actions are at preliminary stages or stayed 

government investigations we have cooperated with federal state and foreign governmental agencies and officials investigating or otherwise seeking information testimony andor documents regarding the 2017 cybersecurity incident and related matters and these investigations have been resolved as discussed in prior filings 

the uk’s financial conduct authority “fca” opened an enforcement investigation against our uk subsidiary equifax limited in october 2017 the investigation by the fca has involved a number of information requirements and interviews we continue to respond to the information requirements and are cooperating with the investigation 

although we continue to cooperate in the canadian class action proceedings and the fca investigation an adverse outcome to any such proceedings and investigation could subject us to fines or other obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

cfpb matter 

in december 2021 we received a civil investigative demand a “cid” from the cfpb as part of its investigation into our consumer disputes process in order to determine whether we have followed the fcras requirements for the proper handling of consumer disputes the cid requests the production of documents and answers to written questions we are cooperating with the cfpb in its investigation and are in discussions with the cfpb regarding our response to the cid at this time we are unable to predict the outcome of this cfpb investigation including whether the investigation will result in any action or proceeding against us 

other 

equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims regulatory matters government investigations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have defenses to and where appropriate will contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process

recent events and company outlook 

as further described above we operate in the us which represented 78 of our revenue in 2021 and internationally in 23 countries our products and services span a wide variety of vertical markets including financial services mortgage federal state and local governments automotive telecommunications and many others 

in march 2020 the world health organization designated the novel coronavirus disease “covid19” as a global pandemic during 2020 and 2021 we followed applicable requirements and protocols published by the us centers for disease control the world health organization and federal state and local governments we have relied on our business continuity plans at various times which has periodically resulted in a portion of our employee population working remotely depending on their role to date the change to our working environment has not caused material disruptions in the execution of our strategic plans and has not impacted our internal controls financial reporting systems or operations the impact of covid19 pandemic remains uncertain and may affect certain markets or regions we serve differently 

demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity small commercial credit and marketing activity and employee hiring and onboarding activity demand is also enhanced by our initiatives to expand our products capabilities and markets served the impact of covid19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our consolidated operating results in the first quarter of 2020 during 2020 overall revenue grew reflecting strong us mortgage market demand in 2020 compared to 2019 and growth across our workforce solutions business the impact on the operating results in each country in which we operate differed based on the conditions and the 

vertical markets we serve in that country with the impact of the pandemic experienced most severely by our international business in 2021 as efforts to minimize the spread of covid19 have been more successful and access to vaccinations has increased our consolidated revenue grew when compared to 2020 reflecting recovering country economies growth from equifax initiatives and to a lesser extent revenue from acquired companies a more thorough discussion of our business unit results are included under the heading “segment financial results” in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section of this form 10k 

for 2022 our planning assumes economies in which we operate to continue to show growth relative to 2021 in the us 2022 economic activity as measured by gdp is expected to grow but not at the same rate of growth experienced in 2021 we expect modest growth in consumer credit excluding mortgage over the course of 2022 our plan assumes the us mortgage market as measured by credit inquiries is expected to decline by greater than 20 percent in 2022 versus 2021 the us mortgage market particularly the mortgage refinance portion of the us mortgage market can be significantly impacted by us interest rates and therefore mortgage rates in the international markets in which we operate we expect 2022 economic activity as measured by gdp to improve but less than the rates of growth experienced in 2021

consolidated financial results 

  

operating revenue 

  

revenue for 2021 increased by 19 compared to 2020 the growth was driven by increases in our workforce solutions segment across mortgage and nonmortgage related revenue growth in our international segment and growth in non 

mortgage related revenue in the usis segment the effect of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 504 million or 1 in 2021 compared to 2020 

revenue for 2020 increased by 18 compared to 2019 the growth was driven by our workforce solutions and usis segments primarily due to strong us mortgage volume benefiting both workforce solutions and usis as well as in workforce solutions growth across nonmortgage related businesses including our unemployment claims business this growth was partially offset by declines beginning in the second half of march 2020 across the international segment due to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 245 million or 1 in 2020 compared to 2019 

operating expenses 

  

cost of services cost of services increased 2435 million in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase is due to increased royalty costs production costs which include third party cloud usage fees and people costs partially offset by a decrease in incremental technology and data security costs related to our ongoing technology transformation the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates increased cost of services by 275 million 

cost of services increased 2157 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase is due to increased royalty and production costs as well as incremental technology and data security costs related to our ongoing technology transformation the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 104 million 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 21 million in 2021 compared to 2020 the slight increase in 2021 is due to an increase in people costs offset by a decrease in incremental technology and data security costs related to our ongoing technology transformation the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our selling general and administrative expenses by 97 million 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 6677 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease in 2020 is primarily due to losses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident that were recorded in 2019 but did not recur in 2020 partially offset by increased people costs and a restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2020 the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 102 million 

  

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for 2021 and 2020 increased by 894 million and 599 million respectively the increase is due to amortization of capitalized internaluse software and systems costs as well as higher amortization of purchased intangible assets related to recent acquisitions 

  

operating income and operating margin 

  

total company operating margin increased by 67 percentage points in 2021 versus 2020 the margin increase is due to higher operating income generated by the increased revenue and decreased incremental technology and data security costs partially offset by the increased people costs and aforementioned increase in depreciation and amortization expense 

total company operating margin increased in 2020 versus 2019 primarily due to increased revenue in 2020 and losses net of insurance recoveries in 2019 of 8009 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident which are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income loss that did not recur in 2020 

interest expense and other income expense net 

  

interest expense increased in 2021 when compared to 2020 due to a higher weighted average outstanding amount of debt in 2021 when compared to 2020 offset by a slightly lower cost of debt 

interest expense increased in 2020 when compared to 2019 due to the issuance of 10 billion in senior notes in april 2020 and 7500 million senior notes issued in november 2019 this increase was partially offset by interest related to outstanding commercial paper and receivables funding facility balances in 2019 

the decrease in other income net in 2021 is driven by the changes in our fair value adjustments of our investments and marktomarket adjustments for our pension assets we recorded a 640 million loss on the fair value adjustment of our brazil investment in 2021 compared to a 1495 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our brazil and india investments in 2020 for 2021 and 2020 we recorded a 202 million and 322 million loss respectively on the marktomarket adjustment of our pension plan assets these impacts were partially offset by positive impacts of foreign currency exchange in 2021 

the increase in other income net in 2020 is primarily due to gains recorded related to the fair value adjustment of our investment in brazil of 1166 million due to its initial public offering in the third quarter of 2020 as well as the 329 million gain recorded related to a fair value adjustment of the equity investment in india for which we completed the acquisition of the remaining shareholder interest in the first quarter of 2020 this was partially offset by the 322 million marktomarket fair value adjustment of pension assets which resulted in a loss during the fourth quarter of 2020 

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate was 212 for 2021 down from 232 for the same period in 2020 our effective tax rate is lower for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 due to a lower foreign rate differential due to the changes in the fair value of our investment in brazil 

  

our effective tax rate was 232 for 2020 up from 86 for the same period in 2019 our effective tax rate was higher for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 due to the operating loss of the company in 2019 and permanent tax differences resulting from certain nondeductible amounts related to the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

net income loss 

  

consolidated net income increased by 2223 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to increased operating income partially offset by the decrease in other income net and increase in income tax expense 

consolidated net income loss increased by 9043 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to increased revenue the 2019 accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident that did not recur in 2020 and an increase in other income resulting from the fair value adjustments of the brazil and india investments the current year increase is partially offset by higher tax expense people costs royalty costs technology costs depreciation of capitalized projects and interest expense

revenue increased 32 in 2020 compared to 2019 due to increases in our unemployment claims management services as us unemployment claims increased substantially due to the economic impact of covid19 on the us economy this was partially offset principally by declines in our tax management services and affordable care act compliance services

financing activities 

  

borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm repayments primarily represent repayments or borrowings of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and as availability allows 

  

increase in shortterm borrowings in 2021 is due to net shortterm borrowings of our cp notes the decrease in net shortterm repayments in 2020 and 2019 primarily relates to the net repayments of our cp notes 

in august 2021 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 235 tenyear senior notes due 2031 the “2031 notes” in an underwritten public offering interest on the 2031 notes accrues at a rate of 235 per year and is payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year beginning on march 15 2022 the net proceeds of the sale of the 2031 notes were used to repay the 3000 million 36 senior notes due 2021 and 3000 million floating rate notes due 2021 the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of borrowings under our cp program and the funding of acquisitions including the company’s 1825 billion acquisition of appriss insights in addition we also entered into a new 7000 million delayed draw term loan facility during august 2021 

in april 2020 we issued 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 26 fiveyear senior notes due 2025 the 2025 notes and 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 31 tenyear senior notes due 2030 the 2030 notes in an underwritten public offering interest on the 2025 notes accrues at a rate of 26 per year and is payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year interest on the 2030 notes accrues at a rate of 31 per year and is payable semiannually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 of each year the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and revolver while the remaining funds were used for general corporate purposes 

in november 2019 we issued 7500 million aggregate principal amount of 26 fiveyear senior notes due 2024 the “2024 notes” in an underwritten public offering interest on the 2024 notes accrues at a rate of 26 per year and is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and our cp program and for general corporate purposes 

payments on longterm debt in 2021 reflect payments on the 23 senior notes 36 senior notes and floating rate notes that were due in 2021 using proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and the new term loan payments on longterm debt in 2020 and 2019 reflect payments on our receivable facility using proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes 

credit facility availability in august 2021 the company refinanced the existing unsecured revolving credit facility of 11 billion set to expire september 2023 and entered into a new 15 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolver” and a new 7000 million delayed draw term loan “term loan” collectively known as the “senior credit facilities” both which mature in august 2026 borrowings under the senior credit facilities may be used for working capital for capital expenditures to refinance existing debt to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes the revolver includes an option to request a maximum of three oneyear extensions of the maturity date any time after the first anniversary of the closing date of the revolver we believe we are currently in compliance with all representations and warranties necessary as a condition for borrowing under the revolver but we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all such conditions for borrowing in the future availability of the revolver is reduced by the outstanding principal balance of our cp notes and by any letters of credit issued under the revolver 

in the third quarter of 2021 we increased the size of our cp program from 11 billion to 15 billion consistent with the increase in our revolver our 15 billion cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our revolver and the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver and by any letters of credit issued under the facility 

as of december 31 2021 there were 3219 million of outstanding cp notes 07 million of letters of credit outstanding no outstanding borrowings under the revolver and 7000 million outstanding under the term loan availability under the revolver was 11774 million at december 31 2021 

  

at december 31 2021 approximately 81 of our debt was fixed rate and 19 was variable rate our variablerate debt consists of cp and term loan borrowings the interest rate resets periodically based on the terms of the respective financing arrangement at december 31 2021 the interest rate on our variablerate debt ranged from 024 to 138 

in november 2020 we terminated our 2250 million receivables funding facility the “receivables facility” 

debt covenants a downgrade in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program revolver and term loan and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including for example limits on mortgages liens saleleaseback transactions mergers and sales of assets 

in august 2021 we entered into our new senior credit facilities as noted above in anticipation of the appriss insights acquisition the senior credit facilities include a maximum leverage ratio defined as consolidated funded debt divided by consolidated ebitda for the preceding four quarters of i 375 to 10 initially ii 425 to 10 for the first fiscal quarter ending 

after the consummation of the company’s acquisition of appriss insights on october 1 2021 the “appriss closing date” until the fourth fiscal quarter ending after the appriss closing date iii 40 to 10 for the fifth fiscal quarter ending after the appriss closing date until the sixth fiscal quarter ending after the appriss closing date and iv 375 to 10 for the seventh fiscal quarter ending after the appriss closing date and through the remaining term of the revolver we may also elect to increase the maximum leverage ratio by 05 to 10 subject to a maximum leverage ratio of 475 to 10 in connection with certain material acquisitions if we satisfy certain requirements the senior credit facilities also permit cash in excess of 175 million to be netted against debt in the calculation of the leverage ratio subject to certain restrictions 

none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations as of december 31 2021 the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however our 33 senior notes due 2022 395 senior notes due 2023 26 senior notes due 2024 26 senior notes due 2025 325 senior notes due 2026 31 senior notes due 2030 235 senior notes due 2031 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the “senior notes” contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announces the company’s intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2021 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb with a stable outlook for sp and baa2 with a stable outlook for moody’s a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program revolver and term loan and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment these ratings are subject to change as events and circumstances change

other planned uses of capital 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing new product development security and our technology as well as continue to make strategic acquisitions that align with our business strategy additions to property and equipment will continue in order to support growth in our technology transformation and new product development although we expect spending related to capital expenditures for the next twelve months to be down slightly from current levels 

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1564 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards related to the assets remain with the company

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan “usrip” that covers approximately 8 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was closed to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a retirement plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution components that cover most salaried and hourly employees in canada the crip the defined benefit component was also closed to new hires on october 1 2011 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2021 we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip and made contributions of 28 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip or the crip at december 31 2021 the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we anticipate the settlement of our crip liabilities during 2022 and have taken steps to adopt a more conservative asset allocation to decrease equity exposure and increase cash we believe additional funding contributions would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplemental retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

inflation in the countries in which we operate may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising us interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the us securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability increases in us interest rates may also negatively impact the us mortgage market which may adversely affect the company’s revenue financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets statements of income loss and statements of comprehensive income loss we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

  

in accordance with asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” we recognize revenue when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer and the customer obtains control of the good or service in order to recognize revenue we note that the two parties must have an agreement that creates enforceable rights the performance obligations must be distinct and the transaction price can be determined our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transactional basis in which distinct services are delivered over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services delivered to measure our performance over time the output method is utilized to measure the value to the customer based on the transfer to date of the services promised with no rights of return once consumed in these cases revenue on transactional contracts with a defined price but an undefined quantity is recognized utilizing the right to invoice expedient resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed additionally multiyear contracts with defined pricing but an undefined quantity that utilize tier pricing would be defined as a series of distinct performance obligations satisfied over time utilizing the same method of measurement the output method with no rights of return once consumed this measurement method is applied on a monthly basis resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed 

additionally we recognize revenue from subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue from subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are delivered any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue from subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term multiyear subscription contracts are analyzed to determine the 

full contract transaction price over the term of the contract and the subsequent price is ratably recognized over the full term of the contract 

revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment from the customer if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of the performance obligation revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 

we sell certain offerings that contain multiple performance obligations these obligations may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services in order to account for each of these obligations separately the delivered promises within our contracts must meet the criterion to be considered distinct performance obligations to our customer if we determine that the arrangement does not contain separate distinct obligations the performance obligations are bundled together until a distinct obligation is achieved this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract obligation is delivered to our customer or ratably over the term of the contract 

some of our arrangements with multiple performance obligations involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the installation of interfaces or platforms by our technology personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these installation services do not meet the requirement for being distinct thus any related installation fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related services revenue from the delivery of onetime files and models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of installation of a customer are capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the identifiable asset 

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction and therefore do not have control 

  

in certain instances within our debt collections and recovery management services in our international operating segment and certain tax management services within our workforce solutions operating segment variable consideration is constrained due to the fact that the revenue is contingent on a particular outcome within our debt collections and recovery management businesses revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the debt is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit approval from a regulatory agency or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

certain costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of a performance obligation are deferred as contract costs and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of transfer of the related goods and services these costs generally consist of labor costs directly relating to the implementation and setup of the contract 

judgments and uncertainties – each performance obligation within a contract must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these distinct goods or services these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its standalone selling price concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectability and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

contract balances – the contract balances are generated when revenue recognized varies from billing in a given period a contract asset is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes more revenue than what has been billed as of december 31 2021 the contract asset balance was 121 million a contract liability is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes less than what has been billed deferred revenue is recognized when we have an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer and have already received consideration from the customer we generally expect to recognize our deferred revenue as revenue within twelve months of being recorded based on the terms of the contracts 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have six reporting units workforce solutions usis asia pacific europe latin america and canada 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 we integrated our global consumer solutions business into our usis workforce solutions and international operating segments us consumer credit monitoring solutions businesses were moved to usis with the us consumer identity theft protection business moved to workforce solutions all international consumer credit marketing solutions businesses have been moved into the canada and europe reporting units based on the geographical location of customers these changes in reporting units align with how we plan to manage our business going forward to reflect this new organizational structure we have reallocated goodwill from the legacy global consumer solutions reporting unit to the usis workforce solutions canada and europe reporting units based on relative fair value a change in reporting units requires that goodwill be tested for impairment during 2021 we performed a goodwill impairment test prior to and following the reallocation of goodwill which resulted in no impairment for all reporting units 

we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our workforce solutions usis europe and canada reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units 

the goodwill balance at december 31 2021 for our six reporting units was as follows 

valuation techniques 

we performed a quantitative assessment for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units to determine whether impairment exists from the most recent valuation dates due to the size of the cushion and overall uncertainty in these reporting units due to the negative impacts of covid19 in determining the fair value of the reporting unit we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital expenditures the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies or guideline transactions we believe the benchmark companies used for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our discussion of competition in item 1 of this form 10k and have not significantly changed since the date of our last annual impairment test competition for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units generally includes global consumer credit reporting companies such as experian which offer a product suite similar to the reporting units credit reporting solutions 

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of our last annual impairment test 

growth assumptions 

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion  analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends including the impact and anticipated recovery related to the covid19 global pandemic will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of our asia pacific and latin american reporting units were between 30 and 40 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 

we projected revenue growth in 2022 for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units in completing our 2021 impairment testing based on expected economic recovery from the negative impact the covid19 pandemic has had on these regions in 2021 and planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these reporting units the anticipated revenue growth in these reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses and capital expenditures for the reporting unit which reflects the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth and completion of our technology transformation initiatives 

discount rate assumptions 

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows for the reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2021 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the asia pacific and latin america reporting units were between 90 and 130 

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units exceeded their related carrying values as of september 30 2021 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value due to the lower cushions when compared to other reporting units asia pacific and latin america are more sensitive to changes in the assumptions noted above that could result in a fair value that is less than its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit was greater than 10 

and the excess fair value over carrying value for the latin america reporting unit was greater than 50 as of september 30 2021 

given the relatively smaller excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit we believe that it is at risk of a possible future goodwill impairment although we experienced growth in this reporting unit for the twelve months ended december 31 2021 in comparison to the estimates used in the 2021 goodwill impairment testing the covid19 pandemic has had a substantial negative impact on our results avoidance of a future impairment will be dependent on continued economic recovery from the negative impact caused by covid19 and our ability to execute on initiatives to grow revenue and manage expenses prudently we will continue to monitor the performance of this reporting unit to ensure no interim indications of possible impairment have occurred before our next annual goodwill impairment assessment in september 2022 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote 

in the third quarter of 2017 we announced a cybersecurity incident potentially impacting us canadian and uk consumers as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we were subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k we recorded expenses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million in other current liabilities and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income loss for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses the amount accrued represents our best estimate of the liability related to these matters the company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with asc 4502025 while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued may be incurred it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations described in “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

judgments and uncertainties — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — with the exception of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

  

income taxes 

  

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2021 345 million was recorded for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 71 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

  

purchase accounting for acquisitions 

we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income 

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect our results of operations 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income loss we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2021 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2021 would have increased our revenue by 1074 million and our pretax operating profit by 136 million for the year ended december 31 2020 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2020 would have increased our revenue by 929 million and our pretax operating profit by 86 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2021 and 2020 

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2021 were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2020 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2021 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2022 and rates could go either higher or lower 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate cp the revolver and term loan borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and variablerate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2021 our weighted average cost of debt was 32 and weightedaverage life of debt was 54 years at december 31 2021 81 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 19 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2021 interest expense by 102 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

employer services these services are aimed at reducing the cost of the human resources function of businesses through a broad suite of services including assisting with employment tax matters designed to reduce the cost of unemployment claims through effective claims representation and management and efficient processing and to better manage the tax rate that employers are assessed for unemployment taxes comprehensive services designed to research the availability of employmentrelated tax credits eg federal work opportunity tax credits and to process the necessary filings and assist the client in obtaining the tax credit tax form management services which include initial distribution reissuance and correction of w2 and 1095c forms paperless pay services that enable employees to electronically receive pay statement information as well as review and change direct deposit account or w4 information i9 management services designed to help clients electronically comply with the immigration laws that require employers to complete an i9 form for each new hire and onboarding services using an online platform to complete the new hire process for employees of corporations and government agencies in addition we provide software and services to employers to assist in their compliance with the affordable care act 

the work number ® is our key repository of employment and income data serving our verification services and employer services business units we rely on payroll data received from over one million organizations to regularly update the database the updates occur as employers and other data contributors transmit data electronically to equifax from their payroll systems employers provide this data to us so that we can handle verification requests on behalf of each employer we use this data to provide automated employment and income verification services to verifiers who are lenders employersbackground screeners and government agencies 

  

the fees we charge for services in these two business units are generally on a per transaction basis we have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the database because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to the work number ® database and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to thirdparty employment verification requests while providing them with the assurance that the process is automated and not subject to human interpretation the work number ® database is over 460 million current and historic employment records at december 31 2020

competition 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change our competitors vary widely in size and in the nature of the products and services they offer sources of competition are numerous and include the following 

• competition for our credit information solutions and directtoconsumer solutions products varies by both application and industry but generally includes two global consumer credit reporting companies experian and transunion both of which offer a product suite similar to our credit information solutions in the us lifelock is a national provider of personal identity theft protection service also there are competitors offering free credit scores including credit karma in the us canada and the uk clearscore in the uk and credit simple and credit savvy in australia there are also a large number of competitors who offer competing products in specialized areas such as fraud prevention risk management and application processing and decisioning solutions and software companies offering credit modeling services or analytical tools our differentiators include our unique data assets decisioning technology and the features and functionality of our analytical capabilities we emphasize our improved decision making and product quality while remaining competitive on price we also compete with fair isaac corporation with respect to certain of our analytical tools and solutions and lexisnexis in identity and fraud and other solutions

we assess the principal competitive factors affecting our markets to include our ability to protect information and systems product attributes such as quality depth coverage adaptability scalability interoperability functionality and ease of use product price technical performance including system response time and availability access to unique proprietary databases quickness of response flexibility and client services and support effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts existing market penetration and new product innovation 

technology and intellectual property 

  

we generally seek protection under us federal state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by filing for registration under applicable trademark and patent laws we own a number of patents registered in the us and in several foreign countries we also have both registered and common law trademarks service marks logos and internet domain names in the us and in many foreign countries the most important of which are “equifax” “the work number” “interconnect” “equifax ignite” and variations thereof these marks are used in connection with many of our product lines and services we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents and trademarks are generally important to our operations and competitive position but we do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents however certain company trademarks which contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services including but not limited to the “equifax” trademark are an integral part of our business and their loss could have a significant negative impact on us we also protect certain of our confidential intellectual property and technology with trade secret laws where applicable and through the use of nondisclosure agreements and other means of protecting and limiting access to and use of such information 

  

we license other companies to use certain data software and other technology and intellectual property rights we own or control primarily as core components of our products and services on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards and that are designed to protect our interest in our intellectual property other companies license us to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control for example we license creditscoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10k should be considered and read carefully the risks described below are not the only ones facing us the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below 

technology and data security risks 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could compromise company consumer and customer information interfere with our operations cause us to incur significant costs for remediation and enhancement of our it systems and expose us to legal liability all of which could have a substantial negative impact on our business and reputation 

we are a global data analytics and technology company in the ordinary course of business we collect process transmit and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of consumers employees and strategic partners the secure operation of our information technology networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy because our products and services involve the storage and transmission of personal information of consumers we will routinely be the 

target of attempted cyber and other security threats by outside third parties including technically sophisticated and wellresourced bad actors attempting to access or steal the data we store insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern for all companies including ours despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training and contractual precautions our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access to data or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct attacks by hackers employee or insider malfeasance andor human error 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and often are not recognized until launched against a target or even some time after we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis even if our security measures are appropriate reasonable andor comply with applicable legal requirements certain efforts may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect further we are in the process of transforming our applications and infrastructure technologies and this transition to cloudbased technologies may expose us to additional cyber threats as we migrate our data from our legacy systems to cloudbased solutions hosted by third parties although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections these security measures cannot provide absolute security 

in 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers if we experience additional breaches of our security measures including from incidents that we fail to detect for a period of time sensitive data may be accessed stolen disclosed or lost any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to significant litigation regulatory fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations we cannot ensure that our insurance policies in the future will be adequate to cover losses from any future security breaches for example our 1250 million cybersecurity insurance policy was not adequate to cover the losses we have incurred to date from the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

security breaches and the adverse publicity that may follow could also have a negative impact on our reputation and our relationship with our customers for example our reputation with consumers and other stakeholders and our customer relationships were damaged following the 2017 cybersecurity incident resulting in a negative impact on our revenue if we experience another material cybersecurity incident or are otherwise unable to demonstrate the security of our systems and the data we maintain and retain the trust of our customers consumers and data suppliers we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business 

if we fail to achieve and maintain key industry or technical certifications our customers and business partners may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business which would negatively affect our revenue 

we are required by customers and business partners to obtain various industry or technical certifications such certifications are critical to our business because certain of our current and potential customers and the contracts governing certain customer relationships as well as certain of our data suppliers require us to maintain them as a requirement of doing business for example as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we lost certain key certifications which caused certain customers and business partners to stop or pause doing business with us and temporarily limited our ability to win new business we had to spend significant resources on remediation activities in order to obtain these key recertifications if we fail to achieve or maintain key industry or technical certifications as a result of another cybersecurity incident or for other reasons customers and business partners may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business which would negatively affect our revenue 

strategy and market demand risks 

our business has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by the recent covid19 outbreak 

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks including the global outbreak of covid19 in 2020 the covid19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts by governments to attempt to control its spread have adversely impacted the global economy leading to reduced consumer spending and lending activities and disruptions and volatility in the global capital markets our customers and therefore our business and revenues are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions we experienced significant revenue declines in several of our markets as a result of covid19 we expect that the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our operating revenue will continue until health and economic conditions improve 

we continue to work with our stakeholders including customers employees consumers suppliers business partners and local communities to responsibly address this global pandemic we will continue to monitor the situation and assess possible implications to our business and our stakeholders and will take appropriate actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences we cannot assure you that we will be successful in any such mitigation efforts the extent to which the coronavirus will continue to negatively impact our operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration of the outbreak new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the covid19 pandemic outbreaks occurring at any of our facilities the actions taken to control the spread of covid19 or treat its impact and changes in worldwide and us economic conditions further deteriorations in economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise could lead to a further or prolonged decline in demand for our products and services and negatively impact our business it may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing or the terms of any such financing we cannot at this time predict the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic and its resulting economic impact but it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k such as our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to protect our information technology networks and infrastructure from unauthorized access misuse malware phishing and other events that could have a security impact as a result of our remote working environment or otherwise 

the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our technology transformation strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results 

we expect our technology transformation strategy including our transition to cloudbased technologies will significantly increase our efficiency and productivity the functionality of our products and services as well as decrease the cost of our overall systems infrastructure all of which we expect will drive growth and have a positive effect on our business competitive position and results of operations this initiative is a major undertaking as we replace many of our previous operating systems with cloudbased systems this complex multifaceted and extensive initiative is expensive and may cause material unanticipated problems and expenses if our new systems do not operate as expected or the data we transition to the cloud changes in a material way we may have to incur significant additional costs to make modifications and could lose customers as a result moreover we may experience issues with customer migration as many of our customers may not migrate to cloudbased technologies on a timely basis or at all or may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloudbased technologies 

we cannot assure you that our technology transformation strategy will be beneficial to the extent or within the timeframes expected or that the estimated efficiency cost savings and other improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all market acceptance of cloudbased offerings is affected by a variety of factors including information security reliability performance the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies customer and data provider concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data as well as the customer’s ability to access this data once a contract has expired and consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers if we are unable to correctly respond to these issues we may experience business disruptions damage to our reputation negative publicity diminished customer trust and relationships and other adverse effects on our business even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized there may be consequences internal control issues or business impacts that were not expected our transition and migration to cloudbased technologies may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical legal or other costs 

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number ® and telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange for a variety of reasons including concerns of data furnishers arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use additional security breaches or competitive reasons our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data 

due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection disclosure or use of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be adversely affected which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share and reputational loss there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

negative changes in general economic conditions including interest rates unemployment rates income home prices investment values and consumer confidence could adversely affect us 

our customers and therefore our business and revenues are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions including the demand and availability of affordable credit and capital the level and volatility of interest rates inflation employment levels consumer confidence and housing demand both inside and outside the united states business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity which can be impacted by changes in interest rates banks’ and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit are adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth 

our customer base suffers when financial markets experience volatility illiquidity and disruption and the potential for increased and continuing disruptions going forward presents considerable risks to our business and revenue high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for many of our products and services and consequently our revenue and results of operations as consumers may postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our revenue and operating margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services new competitors may choose to enter and compete in our markets or existing competitors may choose to introduce new products and enter markets that we serve and that they do not currently serve the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services or some of our customers may develop products of their own that replace the products they currently purchase from us which would result in lower revenue in addition many of our competitors have extensive consumer relationships including relationships with our current and potential customers moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the us mortgage market changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single or dual bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

some of our competitors may choose to sell products that compete with ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as a part of integrated suites given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

if our relationships with key customers are materially diminished or terminated our business could suffer 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time many of our material customer agreements can be terminated by the customer for convenience on advance written notice which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to award more business to our competitors there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers or business partners on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers or business partners the loss of one or more of our major customers or business partners could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner or if the market does not adopt our new services our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process our resources have to be committed to any new products and services before knowing whether the market will adopt the new offerings in addition our management is and will continue to be intensely focused on enhancing our security measures and our technology transformation and may not be able to devote as much time or resources to new product development which could cause us to be less competitive as compared to our peers lose out on new revenue opportunities and have an adverse effect on our growth and our business 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue in addition governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and global consumer solutions business units recently there also has been an increase in companies offering free or lowcost directtoconsumer credit services such as credit scores reports and monitoring as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to other products and services to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we rely in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial operating results or it and data security profile we expect in addition if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances our growth may be adversely impacted 

historically we have relied in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business any acquisitions we do complete may not be on favorable terms may involve greaterthanexpected liabilities and expenses potential impairments of tangible and intangible assets or significant writeoffs and the expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies it systems and personnel into our operations it and data security profiles of acquired companies may not meet our technological standards and may take longer to integrate and remediate than planned this may result in significantly greater transaction remediation and integration costs for future acquisitions than we have experienced historically or it could mean that we will not pursue certain acquisitions where the costs of integration and remediation are too significant we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence and acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside of the us will increase our exposure to risks of conducting operations in international markets these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business 

distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

despite our past experience opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances may not be available to us in the future in addition our focus on data security and our technology transformation strategy including our migration to cloudbased technologies may limit our ability to identify and complete acquisitions as we will have less time and resources to devote to identifying suitable acquisition candidates and our technological criteria and standards for acquisition candidates may increase 

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state and local governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting a number of our federal government contracts have received enhanced scrutiny and media attention due to the sensitive nature of the data we handle and due to the importance of the government programs we support if we experience another material cybersecurity incident if public scrutiny and pressure related to government services we support turns negative or if we experience uptime issues or performance problems our ability to maintain existing or acquire new government contracts may be substantially impacted 

also the government programs to which we provide services or which are the bases of compliance services we provide nongovernmental clients including in particular the employer requirements under the affordable care act may be terminated or substantially altered by the government and our services would no longer be needed if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work if the services we provide are no longer needed due to government program change or termination or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

operational risks 

our technology transformation strategy places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other limited resources 

as part of our technology transformation strategy we are transitioning and migrating our data systems from traditional data centers to cloudbased platforms this initiative places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance and financial resources and internal financial control and reporting function in addition many of our existing personnel do not have experience with native cloudbased technologies and as a result we have and will continue to hire personnel with such experience this effort has been and will continue to be time consuming and costly our technology transformation strategy requires management time and resources to educate employees and implement new ways of conducting business the dedication of resources to our technology transformation strategy and cloudbased technologies limits the resources we have available to devote to other initiatives or growth opportunities or to invest in the maintenance of our existing internal systems we cannot guarantee that our strategy is the right one or that investments in alternative technologies or other initiatives would not be a better use of our limited resources 

additionally as a result of our cloud migration efforts in connection with our technology transformation strategy we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods reorganization and transition can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transition to cloudbased technologies could expose us to operational disruptions 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are managed internally within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties as part of our technology transformation strategy we are upgrading a significant portion of the information technology systems used to operate our business and replacing them with cloudbased solutions this transition will require substantial changes to our software and network infrastructure which could lead to system interruptions affect our data systems and further expose us to 

operational disruptions and cause us to lose customers all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

upon implementation of the new cloudbased solutions much of our information technology systems will consist of outsourced cloudbased infrastructure platform and softwareasaservice solutions not under our direct management or control any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our customers we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 

if our systems do not meet customer requirements for response time or high availability or we experience system constraints or failures or our customers do not migrate to the cloud or modify andor upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins service level penalties or other harm to our business and reputation 

our customers expect high system availability and response time performance as well as a very high degree of system resilience we depend on reliable stable efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network systems and data centers to provide service to our customers many of the services and systems upon which we rely have been outsourced to third parties in addition many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers these systems and operations and the personnel that support service and operate these systems could be exposed to interruption damage or destruction from power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses denialofservice or other cyber attacks employee or insider malfeasance human error fire natural disasters war terrorist acts or civil unrest we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner 

in addition as part of our technology transformation we are seeking to migrate our customers from traditional data platforms to cloudbased products and services many of our customers may not migrate to cloudbased technologies on a timely basis or at all or may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloudbased technologies if our customers’ timelines prevent them from migrating to cloudbased technologies quickly enough they will remain on our legacy infrastructure which could expose them to system availability and response time performance issues 

any significant system interruption or series of minor interruptions could result in the loss of customers andor lost revenues lower margins service level penalties or other significant harm to our business or reputation 

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our technology transformation we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels including with respect to data and system security or increase prices for their services to unreasonable levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unrealized efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition some of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success including our ability to implement our technology transformation strategy depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations such as it and data security which require specialized skills such as migrating legacy computer systems to the cloud data security expertise and analytical modeling if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business as part of our technology transformation strategy we have hired or contracted with a significant number of new employees and contract workers hiring onboarding training motivating retaining and managing employees with the skills required is timeconsuming and expensive there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees if we are not able to hire sufficient employees to support our technology transformation or to train motivate retain and manage the employees we do hire it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

global operational risks 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales outside the us comprised 22 of our total revenue in 2020 as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally and these risks may differ in each jurisdiction we operate depending on the particular product or service we offer in the jurisdiction in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions 

• trade protection measures 

• data privacy and consumer protection laws and regulations 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations 

• business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions 

• difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner 

• implementation of exchange controls 

• geopolitical instability including terrorism and war 

• foreign currency changes 

• increased travel infrastructure legal and compliance costs of multiple international locations 

• foreign laws and regulatory requirements 

• terrorist activity natural disasters pandemics and other catastrophic events 

• restrictions on the import and export of technologies 

• difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable 

• longer payment cycles 

• failure to meet quality standards for outsourced work 

• unfavorable tax rules 

• the presence and acceptance of varying level of business corruption in international markets and 

• varying business practices in foreign countries 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the argentine peso the chilean peso the euro the new zealand dollar the costa rican colon the singapore dollar the brazilian real the russian ruble and the indian rupee because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against major currencies will affect our operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

the uk’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the uk’s withdrawal from the eu referred to as “brexit” including implications for the free flow of labor and goods in the uk and the eu and other financial legal tax and trade implications brexit could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business in the uk including affecting 

our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

as part of a global settlement we entered into agreements with various parties to settle the us consumer mdl litigation and certain federal and state government investigations arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident if we are unable to comply with our obligations under these agreements if the us consumer mdl litigation settlement is not upheld on appeal or if other lawsuits or investigations are filed or commenced it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in july 2019 the company entered into multiple agreements that resolve the us consolidated consumer class action cases captioned in re equifax inc customer data security breach litigation mdl no 2800 consumer cases the “us consumer mdl litigation” and the investigations of the ftc the cfpb the attorneys general of 48 states the district of columbia and puerto rico the “msag group” and the nydfs collectively the “consumer settlement” relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident on january 13 2020 the us district court for the northern district of georgia the “court” entered an order granting final approval of the settlement in connection with the us consumer mdl litigation from which several objectors have appealed until the appeals are finally adjudicated or dismissed and the settlement becomes final in accordance with its terms we can provide no assurance that the us consumer mdl litigation will be resolved as contemplated by the settlement agreement if the court’s order approving the settlement agreement was overturned by an appellate court and not cured in accordance with the terms of the consent orders with the ftc and cfpb the consent orders with the ftc cfpb and msag group would remain in place and the consumer restitution fund as defined below would be administered by the ftc in that event there is a risk that we would not be able to settle the us consumer mdl litigation on acceptable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in addition to the monetary payments and consumer redress we also agreed as part of the consumer settlement to implement certain business practice commitments related to consumer assistance and our information security program including third party assessments of our program these business practice commitments are extensive and require a significant amount of attention from management to the extent we are unable to comply or we are viewed as not being in compliance with these business practice commitments or other requirements of a relevant order we could face an enforcement action or contempt proceeding that could potentially result in fines penalties and new business practice commitments which depending on the amount and type could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in addition other lawsuits and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are still outstanding and additional lawsuits or investigations may be filed commenced or issued the resolution of these additional matters may result in damages costs fines or penalties which depending on the amount could be material to the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods any future losses we incur as a result of the incident will not be covered by insurance 

we and our customers are subject to various current laws and governmental regulations and could be affected by new and evolving consumer privacy and cybersecurity or other datarelated laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain laws and regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy cybersecurity data and financial protection see “item 1 business—governmental regulation” in this form 10k for a summary of the us and foreign consumer and data protection laws and regulations to which we are subject these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business in addition new laws and regulations at the state and federal level are enacted or considered frequently examples of such new and evolving laws and regulations include amendments to the fcra requiring the provision of free credit freezes to consumers cybersecurity and other requirements promulgated by the new york department of financial services the ccpa which took effect on january 1 2020 the california data broker registration requirements that took effect on january 31 2020 and the cpra taking effect on january 1 2023 furthermore we expect there to be an increased focus on laws and regulations related to our business including by the new us presidential administration and the new us congress because of the great public concern in the us with regard to the operation of credit reporting agencies as well as the collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information we also use algorithms artificial intelligence and machine learning in our business processes there are a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy or cybersecurity that could affect us the canadian government has initiated a review of consumer privacy laws and 

several us states have introduced varying comprehensive privacy laws modeled to some degree on the ccpa andor the gdpr compliance with multiple state laws containing varying requirements could be complicated and costly in europe although the gdpr already includes certain provisions relating to the automated processing of personal data there has also been discussion of new legislative proposals to regulate business use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies which if enacted could impose new legal requirements addressing among other issues privacy discrimination and human rights the specifics of such legislation and the number of jurisdictions that will introduce legislation in this area remain unclear at this time in addition a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed or acquired by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use access accuracy and security of such data are possible in the us state laws provide for disparate notification regimes all of which we are subject to further any perception that our practices or products are an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism private class actions reputational harm or claims by regulators which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability 

we devote substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to strive for compliance with applicable regulations and requirements in the future we may be subject to significant additional expense related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations including new laws and evolving interpretations that are difficult to predict and to investigate defend or remedy actual or alleged violations additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state federal and foreign government examinations of or inquiries into our business practices the enactment of new laws and how they are interpreted could impact our business in particular legislative activity in the privacy area may result in new laws that are applicable to us and that may hinder our business for example by restricting use or sharing of consumer data including for marketing or advertising or limiting the use of or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence and machine learning including the use of algorithms and automated processing in ways that could materially affect our business or which may lead to significant increases in the cost of compliance any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in new costs for our operations the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation restrictions on the operation of our business and reputational harm it is difficult to predict the impact on our business if we were subject to allegations of having violated existing laws for example in europe the gdpr which includes extensive regulations for certain security incidents could result in fines of up to four percent of annual worldwide “turnover” a measure similar to revenues in the us in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products moreover our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation depend in part on customers’ adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with consumer expectations and regulatory requirements we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• amendment enactment or interpretation of laws and regulations that restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions or the supply of data available to customers 

• changes in cultural and consumer attitudes in favor of further restrictions on information collection and sharing which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions 

• failure of data suppliers or customers to comply with laws or regulations where mutual compliance is required 

• failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations and 

• failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient cost effective manner 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise adversely affect our business 

the cfpb has supervisory and examination authority over our business and may initiate enforcement actions with regard to our compliance with federal consumer financial laws 

the cfpb which was established under the doddfrank act and commenced operations in july 2011 has broad authority over our business this includes authority to issue regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws such as under fcra and other laws applicable to us and our financial customers the cfpb is authorized to prevent “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority 

in 2012 credit reporting companies like us became subject to a federal supervision program for the first time under the cfpb’s authority to supervise and examine certain nondepository institutions that are “larger participants” of the consumer credit reporting market the cfpb conducts examinations and investigations and may issue subpoenas and bring civil actions in federal court for violations of the federal consumer financial laws including fcra in these proceedings the cfpb can seek relief that includes rescission or reformation of contracts restitution disgorgement of profits payment of damages limits on activities and civil money penalties of up to 10 million per day for known violations the cfpb conducts periodic examinations of us and the consumer credit reporting industry which could result in new regulations or enforcement actions or proceedings actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them 

although we have committed resources to enhancing our compliance programs actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us could result in reputational harm our compliance costs and legal and regulatory exposure could increase materially if the cfpb or other regulators enact new regulations change regulations that were previously adopted modify through supervision or enforcement past regulatory guidance or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than have been previously interpreted 

regulatory oversight of our contractual relationships with certain of our customers may adversely affect our business 

the federal banking agencies including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the cfpb as well as many state banking agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships this guidance requires more rigorous oversight of thirdparty relationships that involve certain “critical activities” in light of this guidance our existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance may continue to revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with us which may adversely affect our relationship with such customers in 2018 we entered into a consent order with certain state banking regulators in response to their multistate review of our information security program this consent order obligates us to among other things make certain changes to our corporate governance and information security practices if we are unable or otherwise fail to comply with this consent order our ability to do business with financial institutions in those states could be impaired it is possible that the consent order or other actions resulting from examinations by federal or state banking regulators could lead to adverse changes in our customer relationships 

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision that provides an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits both individual and class action against us alleging a violation of the fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years 

third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

there has been substantial litigation in the us regarding intellectual property rights in the information technology industry from time to time third parties may make claims that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to each such claim on a case by case basis a dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property can be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the inherent uncertainty of intellectual property litigation could divert our management and key personnel from 

our business operations and we may not prevail a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or providing commercial leverage for negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all although our policy is to obtain licenses or other rights where necessary we cannot provide assurance that we have obtained all required licenses or rights 

third parties may misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as contract restrictions confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to devote significant resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect misappropriation or infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect misappropriation or infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because a third party has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and postretirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

litigation and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident   

in fiscal 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers following the 2017 cybersecurity incident hundreds of class actions and other lawsuits were filed against us typically alleging harm from the incident and seeking various remedies including monetary and injunctive relief we were also subject to investigations and inquiries by federal state and foreign governmental agencies and officials regarding the 2017 cybersecurity incident and related matters most of these lawsuits and government investigations have concluded or been resolved including pursuant to the settlement agreements described below while others remain ongoing the company’s participation in these settlements does not constitute an admission by the company of any fault or liability and the company does not admit fault or liability 

consumer settlement 

on july 19 2019 and july 22 2019 we entered into multiple agreements that resolve the us consolidated consumer class action cases captioned in re equifax inc customer data security breach litigation mdl no 2800 the “us consumer mdl litigation” and the investigations of the ftc the cfpb the attorneys general of 48 states the district of columbia and puerto rico the msag group and the nydfs collectively the “consumer settlement” under the terms of the consumer settlement the company will contribute 3805 million to a nonreversionary settlement fund the “consumer restitution fund” to provide restitution for us consumers identified by the company whose personal information was compromised as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident as well as to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs and expenses for the plaintiffs’ counsel in the us consumer mdl litigation not to exceed 805 million settlement administration costs and notice costs the company has agreed to contribute up to an additional 1250 million to the consumer restitution fund to cover certain unreimbursed costs and expenditures incurred by affected us consumers in the event the 3805 million in the consumer restitution fund is exhausted the company also agreed to various business practice commitments related to consumer assistance and its information security program including conducting third party assessments of its information security program 

on january 13 2020 the northern district of georgia the us district court overseeing centralized pretrial proceedings for the us consumer mdl litigation and numerous other federal court actions relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the “mdl court” entered an order granting final approval of the settlement in connection with the us consumer mdl litigation the mdl court entered an amended order granting final approval of the settlement on march 17 2020 several objectors have appealed the final approval order until the appeals are finally adjudicated or dismissed and the settlement becomes final in accordance with its terms we can provide no assurance that the us consumer mdl litigation will be resolved as contemplated by the settlement agreement if the court’s order approving the settlement agreement was overturned by an appellate court and not cured in accordance with the terms of the consent orders with the ftc and cfpb the consent orders with the ftc cfpb and msag group would remain in place and the consumer restitution fund would be administered by the ftc in that event there is a risk that we would not be able to settle the us consumer mdl litigation on acceptable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

other settlements 

financial institutions mdl class action  on may 15 2020 the company entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated financial institutions class action cases pending before the mdl court the “financial institutions mdl litigation” under the settlement the company agreed to pay for valid claims submitted by class members up to a maximum amount reasonable settlement administration and notice costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses the company also agreed to adopt andor maintain certain business practices related to its information security program the court granted final approval of the settlement on october 22 2020 

other matters 

we face other lawsuits and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident that have not yet been concluded or resolved these ongoing matters may result in judgments fines or penalties settlements or other relief we dispute the allegations in the remaining lawsuits and intend to defend against such claims set forth below are descriptions of the main categories of these matters 

georgia state court consumer class actions four putative class actions arising from the 2017 cybersecurity incident were filed against us in fulton county superior court and fulton county state court in georgia based on similar allegations 

and theories as alleged in the us consumer mdl litigation and seek monetary damages injunctive relief and other related relief on behalf of georgia citizens these cases were transferred to a single judge in the fulton county business court and three of the cases were consolidated into a single action on july 27 2018 the fulton county business court granted the company’s motion to stay the remaining single case and on august 17 2018 the fulton county business court granted the company’s motion to stay the consolidated case these cases remain stayed pending final resolution of the us consumer mdl litigation 

canadian class actions five putative canadian class actions four of which are on behalf of a national class of approximately 19000 canadian consumers are pending against us in ontario british columbia and alberta each of the proposed canadian class actions asserts a number of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and other related relief in connection with the 2017 cybersecurity incident in addition to seeking class certification on behalf of the approximately 19000 canadian consumers whose personal information was allegedly impacted by the 2017 cybersecurity incident in some cases plaintiffs also seek class certification on behalf of a larger group of canadian consumers who had contracts for subscription products with equifax around the time of the incident or earlier and were not impacted by the incident 

on december 13 2019 the court in ontario granted certification of a nationwide class that includes all impacted canadians as well as canadians who had subscription products with equifax between march 7 2017 and july 30 2017 who were not impacted by the incident our motion for leave to appeal this decision was granted in part and our appeal is now pending all remaining purported class actions are at preliminary stages or stayed 

government investigations we have cooperated with federal state and foreign governmental agencies and officials investigating or otherwise seeking information testimony andor documents regarding the 2017 cybersecurity incident and related matters except as described below these investigations have been resolved as discussed in prior filings or there has been no further activity 

the uk’s financial conduct authority “fca” opened an enforcement investigation against our uk subsidiary equifax limited in october 2017 the investigation by the fca has involved a number of information requirements and interviews we continue to respond to the information requirements and are cooperating with the investigation 

other 

equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims regulatory matters government investigations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have defenses to and where appropriate will contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process

recent events and company outlook 

as further described above we operate in the united states which represented 78 of our revenue in 2020 and internationally in 24 countries our products and services span a wide variety of vertical markets including financial services mortgage federal state and local governments automotive telecommunications and many others 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization designated the novel coronavirus disease “covid19” as a global pandemic the impact of covid19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our consolidated operating results in march 2020 the impact on the operating results in each country in which we operate differed based on the conditions and the vertical markets we serve in that country in the united states consolidated revenue grew in each calendar quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 reflecting very strong mortgage market related revenue in both usis and workforce solutions and to a lesser degree higher revenue growth in our workforce solutions unemployment claims management business however in the us we experienced yearoveryear revenue declines in most other vertical markets including commercial financial services and telecommunications internationally all countries in which we operate experienced revenue declines across most vertical markets the yearoveryear reductions in countries and vertical markets referenced were most pronounced in the second quarter and improved during the third and fourth quarters although some countries continue to show yearoveryear declines performance in the fourth quarter of 2020 has improved from the levels seen in the third quarter and several vertical markets and countries have reported year over year growth as market conditions improve we are unable to determine the severity or duration of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on equifax or how the impact on the individual markets in the countries we serve will change with time although consolidated revenue has grown during 2020 when compared to 2019 due to the uncertain effects on the global economy caused by the impact of covid19 the impact on our future results of operations related to the covid19 pandemic are unclear 

we expect that the global covid19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and results of operations while the covid19 pandemic affects the countries in which we operate our critical priorities are 

i the health and safety of our employees and their families 

ii providing support to consumers 

iii helping our customers execute their changing business plans by providing innovative solutions combining our unique data assets and leading analytical and technology capabilities and 

iv executing on our cloud technology data and security transformation per our previously stated plans 

in the first quarter of 2020 we executed on our business continuity plans and formed a crisis management team to address the challenges related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic in march and april 2020 our employees worked from home in each country where we operate with only essential employees in customer support and data center operations working on site at our facilities beginning in may in jurisdictions where local restrictions implemented to prevent the further spread of the virus were lifted our employees began to return to their assigned offices with limits placed on the number of employees on site at one time for employees working at our offices and facilities we have instituted social distancing protocols increased the level of cleaning and sanitizing in those facilities and undertaken other actions to make these sites safer we have also substantially reduced employee travel to only essential business needs as part of our business continuity plans w e are generally following the requirements and protocols published by the us centers for disease control and the world health organization  and s tate and local governments if public health authorities dictate further measures to limit further spread of the virus we may need to reinstate our business continuity plans in certain countries or regions in which we operate as of the date of this filing we do not believe our work from home and return to office protocol have materially adversely impacted our internal controls financial reporting systems or our operations 

our data and analytics product and sales teams are focused on how to refine existing products and services as well as generate new products and services to meet the changing needs of our customers in this environment our technology teams continue to execute on our cloud technology data and security transformation including the continued migration of our technology to cloud native environments to date the change to our working environment has not caused material disruptions in the execution of these plans 

as a response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic we have implemented plans to manage our costs we have significantly limited the addition of new employees and third party contracted services eliminated all travel except where necessary to meet customer or regulatory needs and acted to limit discretionary spending recovery of the global economy from the covid19 induced recession remains uncertain and may require several years to return to economic levels experienced prior to the pandemic and may affect certain markets or regions we serve differently any future asset impairment charges increase in allowance for doubtful accounts or restructuring charges could be more likely and will be dependent on the severity and duration of this crisis 

at december 31 2020 we had approximately 17 billion in cash and 11 billion available to borrow under our revolving credit facility that matures in september 2023 in the second quarter of 2020 we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the maximum leverage ratio through 2021 to provide us with additional financial flexibility 

in light of the evolving health social economic and business environment governmental regulations or mandates and business disruptions that could occur the potential impact that covid19 could have on our financial condition and operating results remains highly uncertain

2017 cybersecurity incident 

in 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers criminals exploited a software vulnerability in a us website application to gain unauthorized access to our network in march 2017 the us department of homeland security distributed a notice concerning the software vulnerability we undertook efforts to identify and remediate vulnerable systems however the vulnerability in the website application that was exploited was not identified by our security processes we discovered unusual network activity in latejuly 2017 and upon discovery promptly investigated the activity once the activity was identified as potential unauthorized access we acted to stop the intrusion and engaged a leading independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the scope of the unauthorized access including the specific information impacted based on our forensic investigation the unauthorized access occurred from midmay 2017 through july 2017 no evidence was found that the company’s core consumer employment and income or commercial reporting databases were accessed on february 10 2020 the us department of justice announced that four members of the chinese people’s liberation army were indicted on criminal charges for their involvement in the 2017 cybersecurity incident

litigation claims and government investigations as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we were subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in part i “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k we did not record any settlement expenses related to the resolution of these proceedings and investigations for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 we recorded expenses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million in other current liabilities and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income loss respectively as of and for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses and net of insurance recoveries the amount accrued represents our best estimate of the liability related to these matters the company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with asc 4502025 

future costs we are currently executing substantial initiatives in security and consumer support and a companywide transformation of our technology infrastructure which we refer to as our technology transformation and incurred substantial increased expenses and capital expenditures in 2018 2019 and 2020 related to these initiatives we expect to continue to incur additional expenses and capital expenditures in 2021 related to these initiatives although at reduced levels as those incurred in 2020 

we incurred significant legal and professional services expenses in 2019 related to the lawsuits claims and government investigations to which we were a party in 2019 and expect to continue to incur these expenses until all matters are fully resolved however as expected the level of legal and professional service expenses related to these matters was significantly lower in 2020 due to the settlement of all of the significant matters in the us 

we will recognize the expenses and capital expenditures referenced herein as they are incurred 

insurance coverage   at the time of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we had 1250 million of cybersecurity insurance coverage above a 75 million deductible to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to this incident since the announcement of the 2017 cybersecurity incident in september 2017 we have received the maximum reimbursement under the insurance policy of 1250 million we also maintained a directors and officers insurance policy of which we have recorded our estimated maximum recoveries as of december 31 2020

consolidated financial results 

  

operating revenue 



  

revenue for 2020 increased by 18 compared to 2019 the growth was driven by our workforce solutions and usis segments primarily due to strong us mortgage volume as well as growth in our workforce solutions unemployment claims business this growth was partially offset by declines beginning in the second half of march 2020 across international and global consumer solutions segments due to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 245 million or 1 in 2020 compared to 2019 

revenue for 2019 increased by 3 compared to 2018 the growth was driven by our workforce solutions and usis segments which was partially offset by declines in international and global consumer solutions workforce solutions saw strong growth driven by verification services usis growth was primarily driven by increases in core credit decisioning volumes and revenue from acquisitions international had local currency growth across latin america and canada the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 747 million or 2 in 2019 compared to 2018 global consumer solutions revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in consumer direct revenue in the us and the uk 

operating expenses 



  

cost of services cost of services increased 2157 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase is due to increased royalty and production costs as well as incremental technology and data security costs related to our ongoing technology transformation the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 104 million 

cost of services increased 813 million in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was due to increased royalty and technology costs we also incurred increased incremental technology and data security costs of 203 million in 2019 these increased technology and security costs predominantly reflect the investments we are making in our technology transformation which include costs for enhanced data security the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 332 million 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses decreased 6677 million in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease in 2020 is primarily due to losses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident that were recorded in 2019 but did not recur in 2020 partially offset by increased people costs and a restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2020 the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 102 million 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 7769 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 the increase in 2019 is primarily due to losses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 244 million

operating income and operating margin 



  

total company operating margin increased in 2020 versus 2019 primarily due to increased revenue in 2020 and losses net of insurance recoveries in 2019 of 8009 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident which are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income loss that did not recur in 2020

interest expense and other income expense net 



  

interest expense increased in 2020 when compared to 2019 due to the issuance of 10 billion in senior notes in april 2020 and 7500 million senior notes issued in november 2019 this increase was partially offset by interest related to outstanding commercial paper and receivables funding facility balances in 2019 

interest expense increased in 2019 when compared to 2018 due to an increase in our overall debt outstanding during the year due to borrowings on our receivables facility and under our commercial paper program these borrowings were paid down with the proceeds from the issuance of the 7500 million senior notes in november 2019 

the increase in other income net in 2020 is primarily due to gains recorded related to the fair value adjustment of our investment in brazil of 1166 million due to its initial public offering in the third quarter of 2020 as well as the 329 million gain recorded related to a fair value adjustment of the equity investment in india for which we completed the acquisition of the remaining shareholder interest in the first quarter of 2020 this was partially offset by the 322 million marktomarket fair value adjustment of pension assets which resulted in a loss during the fourth quarter of 2020 

the increase in other income net in 2019 is primarily due to higher earnings on certain equity method investments and partially offset by an increased loss related to the foreign exchange impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of argentina becoming a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes starting in july 2018

our effective tax rate was 232 for 2020 up from 86 for the same period in 2019 our effective tax rate is higher for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 due to the operating loss of the company in 2019 and permanent tax differences resulting from certain nondeductible amounts related to the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident

general corporate expense decreased 7013 million in 2020 the decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 is due to the legal accruals for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident of 8009 million that were recorded in 2019 and did not recur in 2020 and lower technology costs partially offset by increased people costs and a restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2020 the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted from our continuing efforts to realign our internal resources to support our strategic objectives 

general corporate expense increased 7894 million in 2019 due to the aforementioned losses associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

liquidity and financial condition 

  

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities remain in a strong financial position and manage our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

funds generated by operating activities our revolver and related commercial paper program more fully described below are our most significant sources of liquidity in april 2020 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and revolver while the remaining funds are intended for general corporate purposes at december 31 2020 we had 17 billion in cash balances as well as 11 billion available to borrow under our revolver 

the company has and expects to make payments to resolve certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident described more fully in “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k through 2020 the company made payments of 4393 million for legal settlements related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the remaining 3467 million to be paid to the consumer restitution fund will be made after a final adjudication affirming the us consumer mdl litigation settlement or dismissal of the pending appeals although we expect this payment and the remaining settlement payments to be made in 2021 we can give no assurance that these payments will occur in 2021 due to pending approvals or appeals as a result of the possible payments that could be made in 2021 related to the losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and other requirements funds generated by operating activities may not be sufficient to fund working capital and other cash requirements including for acquisitions and share repurchases throughout 2021 our plan is to finance the payments with existing cash balances and borrowing capacity as necessary 

fund transfer limitations the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to the us may be limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends as of december 31 2020 we held 2596 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries 

information about our cash flows by category is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for 2020 increased by 6324 million compared to 2019 the increase in cash from operations is due to increased net income in 2020 and additional payments made in 2019 associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

cash provided by operating activities for 2019 decreased by 3584 million compared to 2018 the decrease is due to partial payment of the losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident as well as having received 1100 million in insurance proceeds in 2018 

  

investing activities

financing activities 



  

borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm repayments primarily represent repayments or borrowings of outstanding amounts under our commercial paper “cp” program we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and as availability allows 

  

the decrease in net shortterm repayments in 2020 2019 and 2018 primarily relates to the net repayments of our cp notes 

in april 2020 we issued 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 26 fiveyear senior notes due 2025 the 2025 notes and 6000 million aggregate principal amount of 31 tenyear senior notes due 2030 the 2030 notes in an underwritten public offering interest on the 2025 notes accrues at a rate of 26 per year and is payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year interest on the 2030 notes accrues at a rate of 31 per year and is payable semiannually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 of each year the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and revolver while the remaining funds are intended for general corporate purposes which may include the repayment of a portion of the 2021 debt maturities 

in november 2019 we issued 7500 million aggregate principal amount of 26 fiveyear senior notes due 2024 the “2024 notes” in an underwritten public offering interest on the 2024 notes accrue at a rate of 26 per year and will be payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and our cp program and for general corporate purposes 

in may 2018 we issued 3000 million aggregate principal amount of 36 senior notes due 2021 the “2021 notes” 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 395 senior notes due 2023 the “2023 notes” and 3000 million aggregate principal amount floating rate notes due 2021 the “floating rate notes” in an underwritten public offering the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolver our prior 8000 million threeyear delayed draw term loan facility “term loan” and our cp program 

payments on longterm debt in 2020 and 2019 reflect payments on our receivable facility using proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes payments on longterm debt in 2018 reflect 1000 million of payments on the revolver using proceeds from the issuance of 360 floating rate and 395 senior notes in 2018 

credit facility availability in september 2018 the company entered into the 11 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions which will mature in september 2023 the “revolver” the revolver replaced the company’s previous 9000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in november 2020 borrowings under the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs the revolver has an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitment to 16 billion the revolver includes an option to request a maximum of two oneyear extensions of the maturity date any time after the first anniversary of the revolver closing we believe we are currently in compliance with all representations and warranties necessary as a condition for borrowing under the revolver but we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all such conditions for borrowing in the future availability of the revolver is reduced by the outstanding principal balance of our commercial paper notes and by any letters of credit issued under the facility on april 10 2020 we amended our existing revolving credit facility to increase the maximum leverage ratio to provide additional financial flexibility as described further below 

our 11 billion cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our revolver and the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver and by any letters of credit issued under the facility 

  

at december 31 2020 the company had no borrowings outstanding of cp 07 million of letters of credit outstanding and no borrowings outstanding under the revolver at december 31 2020 a total of 110 billion was available under the revolver 

  

at december 31 2020 approximately 93 of our debt was fixed rate and 7 was variable rate our variablerate debt consists of the floating rate notes the interest rate resets periodically based on the terms of the respective financing arrangement at december 31 2020 the interest rate on our variablerate debt was 11 

in november 2020 we terminated our 2250 million receivables funding facility the “receivables facility” 

debt covenants a downgrade in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and revolver and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on mortgages liens and saleleaseback transactions 

on april 10 2020 we amended our existing revolving credit facility to increase the maximum leverage ratio to provide additional financial flexibility the amendment increases the maximum leverage ratio defined as consolidated funded debt divided by consolidated ebitda for the preceding four quarters to i 45 to 10 for fiscal quarters ending on june 30 

2020 through and including september 30 2021 and ii 40 to 10 for the fiscal quarter ending on december 31 2021 the maximum leverage ratio will return to 35 to 10 beginning with the fiscal quarter ending march 31 2022 and thereafter beginning january 1 2021 we may also elect to increase the maximum leverage ratio by 05 to 10 not to exceed 45 to 10 in connection with certain material acquisitions if we satisfy certain requirements the amendment also i permits cash in excess of 200 million to be netted against debt in the calculation of the leverage ratio through september 30 2021 subject to certain restrictions and ii extends the addback of certain expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident to the definition of consolidated ebitda through december 31 2021 

none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2020 the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however our 23 senior notes due 2021 36 senior notes due 2021 floating rate notes due 2021 33 senior notes due 2022 395 senior notes due 2023 26 senior notes due 2024 26 senior notes due 2025 325 senior notes due 2026 31 senior notes due 2030 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the “senior notes” contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announces the company’s intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2020 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb with a negative outlook for sp and baa2 with a stable outlook for moody’s a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and revolver and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment these ratings are subject to change as events and circumstances change

equity transactions 



  

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows

we anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends the actual amount of such dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors and will depend upon future earnings results of operations capital requirements our financial condition and other relevant factors there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at current levels or at all 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2020 the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 



1 the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling 238 million at december 31 2020 total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments there were no fair value adjustments to our debt at december 31 2020 

2 our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment 

3 these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions and certain administrative functions these agreements expire between 2021 and 2027 

4 these longterm liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension postretirement and other compensationrelated plans some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments in the table above we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations as such required funding amounts beyond 2020 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance 

5 this table excludes 271 million of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 

6 for future interest payments on variablerate debt which bears a rate equal to threemonth libor on the interest determination date plus 087 per annum we used the variable rate in effect at december 31 2020 to calculate these payments our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2020 consisted of the floating rate notes the variable rate at december 31 2020 was 11 future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates 

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1564 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards related to the assets remain with the company 

  

letters of credit and guarantees 

  

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance or surety bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2020 and generally have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2020 

  

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan “usrip” that covers approximately 10 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was closed to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a retirement plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution components that cover most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan “crip” the defined benefit component was also closed to new hires on october 1 2011 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2020 we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip or to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip and made contributions of 02 million to the crip at december 31 2020 the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplemental retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans including the change in accounting method adopted in 2020 see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses 

potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets statements of income loss and statements of comprehensive income loss we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

  

in accordance with asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” we recognize revenue when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer and the customer obtains control of the good or service in order to recognize revenue we note that the two parties must have an agreement that creates enforceable rights the performance obligations must be distinct and the transaction price can be determined our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transactional basis in which distinct services are delivered over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services delivered to measure our performance over time the output method is utilized to measure the value to the customer based on the transfer to date of the services promised with no rights of return once consumed in these cases revenue on transactional contracts with a defined price but an undefined quantity is recognized utilizing the right to invoice expedient resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed additionally multiyear contracts with defined pricing but an undefined quantity that utilize tier pricing would be defined as a series of distinct performance obligations satisfied over time utilizing the same method of measurement the output method with no rights of return once consumed this measurement method is applied on a monthly basis resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed 

additionally we recognize revenue from subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue from subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are delivered any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue from subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term multiyear subscription contracts are analyzed to determine the full contract transaction price over the term of the contract and the subsequent price is ratably recognized over the full term of the contract 

revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment from the customer if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of the performance obligation revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 

we sell certain offerings that contain multiple performance obligations these obligations may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services in order to account for each of these obligations separately the delivered promises within our contracts must meet the criterion to be considered distinct performance obligations to our customer if we determine that the arrangement does not contain separate distinct obligations the performance obligations are bundled together until a distinct obligation is achieved this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract obligation is delivered to our customer or ratably over the term of the contract 

some of our arrangements with multiple performance obligations involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the installation of interfaces or platforms by our technology personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these installation services do not meet the requirement for being distinct thus any related installation fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related services revenue from the delivery of onetime files and models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of installation of a customer are capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the identifiable asset 

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction and therefore do not have control 

  

in certain instances within our debt collections and recovery management services in our international operating segment and certain tax management services within our workforce solutions operating segment variable consideration is constrained due to the fact that the revenue is contingent on a particular outcome within our debt collections and recovery management businesses revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the debt is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit approval from a regulatory agency or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

certain costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of a performance obligation are deferred as contract costs and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of transfer of the related goods and services these costs generally consist of labor costs directly relating to the implementation and setup of the contract 

judgments and uncertainties – each performance obligation within a contract must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these distinct goods or services these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its standalone selling price concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectability and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

contract balances – the contract balances are generated when revenue recognized varies from billing in a given period a contract asset is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes more revenue than what has been billed as of december 31 2020 the contract asset balance was 110 million a contract liability is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes less than what has been billed deferred revenue is recognized when we have an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer and have already received consideration from the customer we generally expect to recognize our deferred revenue as revenue within twelve months of being recorded based on the terms of the contracts 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have seven reporting units comprised of usis which includes online information solutions mortgage solutions and financial marketing services asia pacific europe latin america canada global consumer solutions “gcs” and equifax workforce solutions which includes verification services and employer services 

  

the goodwill balance at december 31 2020 for our seven reporting units was as follows 



valuation techniques 

we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our usis workforce solutions europe canada and gcs reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units 

  

we performed a quantitative assessment for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units to determine whether impairment exists from the most recent valuation dates due to the size of the cushion and lower current year forecasts than the 2020 projections from the most recent valuations in relation to our other reporting units in determining the fair value of the reporting unit we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value 

  

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital expenditures the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies or guideline transactions if available we believe the benchmark companies used for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our discussion of competition in item 1 of this form 10k competition for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units generally includes global consumer credit reporting companies such as experian which offer a product suite similar to the reporting units credit reporting solutions 

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

  

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of our last annual impairment test 

growth assumptions 

  

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion  analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends including the potential impact of the covid19 global pandemic will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of our asia pacific and latin american reporting units were between 30 and 50 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 

we projected revenue growth in 2021 for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units in completing our 2020 impairment testing based on expected economic recovery from the negative impact the covid19 pandemic has had on these regions in 2020 planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth the anticipated revenue growth in these reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for the reporting unit which reflects the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth and completion of our technology transformation initiatives 

  

discount rate assumptions 

  

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows for the reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2020 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the asia pacific and latin america reporting units were between 90 and 160 

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

  

the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for our asia pacific and latin america reporting units exceeded their related carrying values as of september 30 2020 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value due to the lower cushions when compared to other reporting units asia pacific and latin america are more sensitive to changes in the assumptions noted above that could result in a fair value that is less than its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit was less than 5 and the excess fair value over carrying value for the latin america reporting unit was between 15 and 20 as of september 30 2020 

given the small excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit we believe that it is at risk of a possible future goodwill impairment although we experienced growth in this reporting unit for the three months ended december 31 2020 in comparison to the estimates used in the 2020 goodwill impairment testing the covid19 pandemic has had a substantial negative impact on our results over the last nine months of 2020 avoidance of a future impairment will be dependent on continued economic recovery from the negative impact caused by covid19 in 2020 and our ability to execute on initiatives to grow revenue and manage expenses prudently we will continue to monitor the performance of this reporting unit to ensure no interim indications of possible impairment have occurred before our next annual goodwill impairment assessment in september 2021 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote 

in the third quarter of 2017 we announced a cybersecurity incident potentially impacting us canadian and uk consumers as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we were subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k we recorded expenses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million in other current liabilities and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income loss for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses the amount accrued represents our best estimate of the liability related to these matters the company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with asc 4502025 while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued may be incurred it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations described in “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

judgments and uncertainties — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — with the exception of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

  

income taxes 

  

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2020 271 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 68 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

  

pension and other postretirement plans 

  

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we voluntarily changed our method of accounting for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans under the accounting method change remeasurement of projected benefit obligation and plan assets are immediately recognized in earnings through net periodic benefit cost within other income expense on the consolidated statements of income loss with pension and postretirement plans to be remeasured annually in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis as triggering events require remeasurement refer to note 1 of the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further discussion 

during 2020 we adopted the new mp2020 mortality improvement scale in determining liability for the us plans the updated projection scale contributed to a slight decrease in the projected benefit obligation partially offsetting the decrease in the discount rates in 2020 the net of which resulted in the increase of the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2020 

during 2019 we adopted the new pri2012 mortality tables and mp2019 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the us plans the updated mortality tables and projection scale partially offset the decrease in the discount rates in 2019 the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2019 

during 2018 we adopted the new mp2018 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the us plans this updated scale along with the change in the discount rates contributed to a decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018 

judgments and uncertainties — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets offset by the actual return on assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analyses specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions to determine the discount rate for our us pension and postretirement benefit plans we use a bond matching approach to select specific bonds that would satisfy our projected benefit payments we believe the bond matching approach reflects the process we would employ to settle our pension and postretirement benefit obligations for our canadian plans we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan taking into consideration the factors noted above our weightedaverage discount rate used to determine benefit obligations was 256 at december 31 2020 

the weighted average expected return on plan assets for 2020 was 646 the weighted average expected return on plan assets for 2021 is 465 the expected return on plan assets was based on the companys review of the asset allocation of the portfolio among various asset classes and represents an estimate of future experience for trust asset returns reflects current and expected future market conditions along with recent changes to the asset allocations the rate is net of investment and administrative expenses paid from the trust 

  

in 2019 the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the termination of the canadian pension plan the canadian plan was frozen effective december 31 2020 at which date we ceased accruing benefits for all active members the obligation is expected to be settled in 2022 with lump sum distributions and an annuity purchase 

  

under the new method of accounting for our pension and postretirement benefit plans the marketrelated value of our assets will be equal to our fair value of plan assets and are remeasured in the fourth quarter with gains and losses recognized through the consolidated statements of income we do not expect our 2021 net periodic benefit income which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different from our 2020 net periodic benefit income see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations 

the effects of a hypothetical change in discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the december 31 2020 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2020 pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations which would be reflected in the 2020 marktomarket expense benefit and 2021 expected pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense 



holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our december 31 2020 expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on 2021 expected pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense 



in addition holding all other assumptions constant an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2021 marktomarket expense benefit 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income loss we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2020 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2020 would have increased our revenue by 507 million and our pretax operating profit by 62 million for the year ended december 31 2019 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2019 would have increased our revenue by 548 million and our pretax operating profit by 102 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2020 and 2019 

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2020 were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2019 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2020 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2021 and rates could go either higher or lower 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper revolver and floating rate notes borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2020 our weighted average cost of debt was 35 and weightedaverage life of debt was 45 years at december 31 2020 93 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 7 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2020 interest expense by 30 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

workforce solutions operates in the us through two business units

employer services these services are aimed at reducing the cost of the human resources function of businesses through a broad suite of services including assisting with employment tax matters designed to reduce the cost of unemployment claims through effective claims representation and management and efficient processing and to better manage the tax rate that employers are assessed for unemployment taxes comprehensive services designed to research the availability of employmentrelated tax credits eg federal work opportunity tax credits and to process the necessary filings and assist the client in obtaining the tax credit tax form management services which include initial distribution reissuance and correction of w2 and 1095c forms paperless pay services that enable employees to electronically receive pay statement information as well as review and change direct deposit account or w4 information i9 management services designed to help clients electronically comply with the immigration laws that require employers to complete an i9 form for each new hire and onboarding services using an online platform to complete the new hire process for employees of corporations and government agencies in addition we provide software and services to employers to assist in their compliance with the affordable care act 

the work number ®  the work number ® is our key repository of employment and income data serving our verification services and employer services business units we rely on payroll data received from tens of thousands of organizations to regularly update the database the updates occur as employers and other data contributors transmit data electronically to equifax from their payroll systems employers provide this data to us so that we can handle verification requests on behalf of each employer we use this data to provide automated employment and income verification services to verifiers who are lenders employersbackground screeners and government agencies 

  

the fees we charge for services in these two business units are generally on a per transaction basis we have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the database because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to the work number ® database and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to thirdparty employment verification requests while providing them with the assurance that the process is automated and not subject to human interpretation the work number ® database is approaching 380 million current and historic employment records at december 31 2019

• state banking and financial services regulatory agencies have asserted either express or implied authority under applicable state laws to examine us as a thirdparty service provider to financial institutions and in certain cases to bring enforcement actions against us generally such examinations and related enforcement actions are focused on assessing our safety and soundness in support of financial institutions we serve

all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10k should be considered and read carefully the risks described below are not the only ones facing us the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could compromise company consumer and customer information interfere with our operations cause us to incur significant costs for remediation and enhancement of our it systems and expose us to legal liability all of which could have a substantial negative impact on our business and reputation 

we are a global data analytics and technology company in the ordinary course of business we collect process transmit and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of consumers employees and strategic partners the secure operation of our information technology networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training and contractual precautions our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access to data or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct attacks by hackers employee or insider malfeasance andor human error for example in 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers 

following the 2017 cybersecurity incident we began undertaking significant remediation efforts and other steps to enhance our data security infrastructure which are ongoing in connection with these efforts we have incurred significant costs and expect to incur additional significant costs as we continue to enhance our data security infrastructure and take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and the data we maintain despite these efforts we cannot assure you that all potential causes of this incident have been identified and remediated and that similar cyber incidents will not occur in the future 

because our products and services involve the storage and transmission of personal information of consumers we will continue to routinely be the target of attempted cyber and other security threats by outside third parties including technically sophisticated and wellresourced bad actors attempting to access or steal the data we store we are in the process of transforming our applications and infrastructure technologies transitioning to cloudbased technologies as we transition to cloudbased technologies we may be exposed to additional cyber threats as we migrate our data from our legacy systems to cloudbased solutions our increased dependence on third parties to store our cloudbased data systems may also subject us to further cyber threats insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern for all companies including ours 

we must continuously plan develop and monitor our information technology networks and infrastructure to identify protect detect respond to and recover from the risk of unauthorized access misuse malware phishing and other events that could have a security impact because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target or even some time after we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis even if our security measures are appropriate reasonable andor in accordance with applicable legal requirements if we experience additional breaches of our security measures including from incidents that we fail to detect for a period of time sensitive data may be accessed stolen disclosed or lost any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to significant litigation regulatory fines penalties losses of customers or reputational damage any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we cannot ensure that our insurance policies in the future will be adequate to cover losses from any future security breaches our 1250 million cybersecurity insurance policy was not adequate to cover the losses we have incurred to date from the 2017 cybersecurity incident and all future losses we incur as a result of the incident will not be covered by insurance in addition our insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 

as part of a global settlement we entered into agreements with various parties to settle the us consumer mdl litigation and certain federal and state government investigations arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident if we are unable to comply with our obligations under these agreements or if other lawsuits or investigations are filed or commenced it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in july 2019 the company entered into multiple agreements that resolve the us consolidated consumer class action cases captioned in re equifax inc customer data security breach litigation mdl no 2800 consumer cases the “us consumer mdl litigation” and the investigations of the ftc the cfpb the attorneys general of 48 states the district of columbia and puerto rico the “msag group” and the nydfs collectively the “consumer settlement” relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident on january 13 2020 the us district court for the northern district of georgia the “court” entered an order granting final approval of the settlement in connection with the us consumer mdl litigation from which several objectors have appealed until the appeals are finally adjudicated or dismissed we can provide no assurance that the us consumer mdl litigation will be resolved as contemplated by the settlement agreement if the court’s order approving the settlement agreement were reversed by an appellate court there is a risk that we would not be able to settle the us consumer mdl litigation on acceptable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in addition to the monetary payments and consumer redress we also agreed as part of the consumer settlement to implement certain business practice commitments related to consumer assistance and our information security program including third party assessments of our program these business practice commitments are extensive and will require a significant amount of attention from management we can provide no assurance that we will be able to comply with these business practice commitments to the extent we were unable to comply or we are viewed as not being in compliance with these business practice commitments or other requirements of a relevant order we could face an enforcement action or contempt proceeding that could potentially result in fines penalties and new business practice commitments which depending on the amount and type could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

in addition other lawsuits and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are still outstanding and additional lawsuits or investigations may be filed commenced or issued the resolution of these additional matters may result in damages costs fines or penalties which depending on the amount could be material to the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

the 2017 cybersecurity incident and the adverse publicity that followed have had a negative impact on our reputation and our relationships with our customers and we cannot assure that it will not have a longterm effect on our relationships with our customers our revenue and our business 

our reputation with consumers and other stakeholders and our customer relationships were damaged following the 2017 cybersecurity incident resulting in a negative impact on our revenue despite our progress made toward repairing our reputation and business relationships if we experience another cybersecurity incident or are otherwise unable to demonstrate the security of our systems and the data we maintain and retain the trust of our customers consumers and data suppliers we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business 

if we fail to achieve and maintain key industry or technical certifications our customers and business partners may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business which would negatively affect our revenue 

we are required by customers and business partners to obtain various industry or technical certifications including from the international organization for standardization “iso” iso certifications specify requirements for establishing implementing operating monitoring reviewing maintaining and improving a documented information security management system industry and technical certifications such as the iso certifications are critical to our business because certain of our current and potential customers and the contracts governing certain customer relationships as well as certain of our data suppliers require us to maintain them as a requirement of doing business as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we lost certain key certifications which adversely affected our business we had to spend significant resources on remediation activities in order to obtain certain recertifications if we fail to achieve or maintain key industry or technical certifications as a result of another cybersecurity incident or for other reasons customers and business partners may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business which would negatively affect our revenue 

the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our technology transformation strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results 

we expect our technology transformation strategy including our transition to cloudbased technologies will significantly increase our efficiency and productivity the functionality of our products and services as well as decrease the cost of our overall systems infrastructure all of which we expect will drive growth and have a positive effect on our business competitive position and results of operations this initiative is a major undertaking as we replace many of our previous 

operating systems with cloudbased systems this complex multifaceted and extensive initiative will be expensive and may cause material unanticipated problems and expenses if our new systems do not operate as expected we may have to incur significant additional costs to modify them moreover we may experience issues with customer migration as many of our customers may not want to migrate or may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloudbased technologies 

we cannot assure you that our technology transformation strategy will be beneficial to the extent or within the timeframes expected or that the estimated efficiency cost savings and other improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all market acceptance of cloudbased offerings is affected by a variety of factors including information security reliability performance the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data as well as the customer’s ability to access this data once a contract has expired and consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers if we are unable to correctly respond to these issues we may experience business disruptions damage to our reputation negative publicity diminished customer trust and relationships and other adverse effects on our business even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized there may be consequences internal control issues or business impacts that were not expected our transition and migration to cloudbased technologies may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical legal or other costs 

our technology transformation strategy places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other limited resources 

as part of our technology transformation strategy we are transitioning and migrating our data systems from traditional data centers to cloudbased platforms this initiative will place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance and financial resources and internal financial control and reporting function in addition many of our existing personnel do not have experience with native cloudbased technologies and as a result we have and will continue to hire personnel with such experience this effort will be time consuming and costly our technology transformation strategy requires management time and resources to educate employees and implement new ways of conducting business the dedication of resources to our technology transformation strategy and cloudbased technologies limits the resources we have available to devote to other initiatives or growth opportunities or to invest in the maintenance of our existing internal systems we cannot guarantee that our strategy is the right one or that investments in alternative technologies or other initiatives would not be a better use of our limited resources 

additionally as a result of our cloud migration efforts in connection with our technology transformation strategy we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods reorganization and transition can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transition to cloudbased technologies could expose us to operational disruptions 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are managed internally within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties as part of our technology transformation strategy we are upgrading a significant portion of the information technology systems used to operate our business and replacing them with cloudbased solutions this transition will require substantial changes to our software and network infrastructure which could lead to system interruptions affect our data systems and further expose us to operational disruptions and cause us to lose customers all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

upon implementation of the new cloudbased solutions much of our information technology systems will consist of outsourced cloudbased infrastructure platform and softwareasaservice solutions not under our direct management or control any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our customers we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 

if our systems do not meet customer requirements for response time or high availability or we experience system constraints or failures or our customers do not modify andor upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other harm to our business and reputation 

we depend on reliable stable efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network systems and data centers to provide service to our customers many of the services and systems upon which we rely have been outsourced to third parties in addition many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers these systems and operations and the personnel that support service and operate these systems could be exposed to interruption damage or destruction from power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses denialofservice or other cyber attacks employee or insider malfeasance human error fire natural disasters war terrorist acts or civil unrest we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner in addition as part of our technology transformation we continue to be intensely focused on enhancing our data security infrastructure and effecting our technology transformation strategy and implementation of those enhancements could result in service interruptions our customers expect high system availability and response time performance as well as a very high degree of system resilience any significant system interruption or series of minor interruptions could result in the loss of customers andor lost revenues lower margins or other significant harm to our business or reputation 

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number ®  financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi and telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange for a variety of reasons including concerns of data furnishers arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use additional security breaches or competitive reasons our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection disclosure or use of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be adversely affected which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share and reputational loss there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

effective september 2018 federal law allows consumers to place freezes on their credit files at all credit bureaus including equifax if a significant number of consumers lock or freeze their file our population of data is reduced which could affect our product offerings and value to our customers in our other businesses 

negative changes in general economic conditions including interest rates unemployment rates income home prices investment values and consumer confidence could adversely affect us 

our customers and therefore our business and revenues are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions including the demand and availability of affordable credit and capital the level and volatility of interest rates inflation employment levels consumer confidence and housing demand both inside and outside the us business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity which can be impacted by changes in interest rates bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit are adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth 

our customer base suffers when financial markets experience volatility illiquidity and disruption and the potential for increased and continuing disruptions going forward presents considerable risks to our business and revenue high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for many of our products and services and consequently our revenue and results of operations as consumers may postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services or some of our customers may develop products of their own that replace the products they currently purchase from us which would result in lower revenue in addition many of our competitors have extensive consumer relationships including relationships with our current and potential customers moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the us mortgage market changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single or dual bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

some of our competitors may choose to sell products that compete with ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as a part of integrated suites given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

our relationships with key longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time many of our material customer agreements can be terminated by the customer for convenience on advance written notice which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to award more business to our competitors 

we also provide our services to business partners who may combine them with their own or other branded services to be offered as a bundle to consumers governmental agencies and businesses in support of fraud or credit protection credit monitoring identity authentication insurance or credit underwriting and collections some of these partners are the largest providers of credit information or identity protection services to the consumer market 

market competition business requirements financial condition and consolidation through mergers or acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand our relationships with our customers and business partners there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers or business partners on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers or business partners the loss of one or more of our major customers or business partners could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner or if the market does not adopt our new services our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process our resources have to be committed to any new 

products and services before knowing whether the market will adopt the new offerings in addition our management is and will continue to be intensely focused on enhancing our security measures and our technology transformation and may not be able to devote as much time or resources to new product development which could cause us to be less competitive as compared to our peers lose out on new revenue opportunities and have an adverse effect on our growth and our business 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue in addition governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and global consumer solutions business units recently there also has been an increase in companies offering free or lowcost directtoconsumer credit services such as credit scores reports and monitoring as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to other products and services to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we and our customers are subject to various current laws and governmental regulations and could be affected by new and evolving consumer privacy and cybersecurity or other datarelated laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain laws and regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy cybersecurity data and financial protection see “item 1 business—governmental regulation” in this form 10k for a summary of the us and foreign consumer and data protection laws and regulations to which we are subject these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business examples of such new and evolving laws and regulations include recent amendments to the fcra requiring the provision of free credit freezes to consumers cybersecurity and other requirements promulgated by the new york department of financial services the taking effect of the ccpa on january 1 2020 and california data broker registration requirements that took effect on january 31 2020 furthermore we expect there to be an increased focus on laws and regulations related to our business because of the great public concern in the us with regard to the operation of credit reporting agencies as well as the collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information which was in part heightened by the 2017 cybersecurity incident we also use algorithms artificial intelligence and machine learning in our business processes there are a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy or cybersecurity that could affect us for example already in 2020 several states have introduced varying comprehensive privacy laws modeled to some degree on the ccpa andor the gdpr compliance with multiple state laws containing varying requirements could be complicated and costly while in the eu the gdpr already includes certain provisions relating to the automated processing of personal data there has also been discussion in the eu of new legislative proposals to regulate business use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies that if enacted could impose new legal requirements addressing among other issues privacy discrimination and human rights as of now the specifics of such legislation are unclear however legislation in this area could also be introduced in other countries in addition a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed or acquired by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use access accuracy and security of such data are possible in the us state laws provide for disparate notification regimes all of which we are subject to further any perception that our practices or products are an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism private class actions reputational harm or claims by regulators which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability 

we devote substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to strive for compliance with applicable regulations and requirements in the future we may be subject to significant additional expense related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations including new laws and evolving interpretations that are difficult to predict and to investigate defend or remedy actual or alleged violations additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state federal and foreign government examinations into or inquiries of our business practices the enactment of new laws and how they are interpreted could impact our business in particular legislative activity in the privacy area may result in new laws that are applicable to us and that may hinder our business for example by restricting use or sharing of consumer data including for marketing or advertising or limiting the use of or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence and machine learning including the use of algorithms and automated processing in ways that could materially affect our business or which may lead to significant increases in the cost of compliance any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable 

laws and regulations could result in new costs for our operations the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation restrictions on the operation of our business and reputational harm it is difficult to predict the impact on our business if we were subject to allegations of having violated existing laws for example in europe the gdpr which includes extensive regulations for certain security incidents could result in fines of up to four percent of annual worldwide “turnover” a measure similar to revenues in the us in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products moreover our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation depend in part on customers’ adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with consumer expectations and regulatory requirements we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• amendment enactment or interpretation of laws and regulations that restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions or the supply of data available to customers 

• changes in cultural and consumer attitudes in favor of further restrictions on information collection and sharing which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions 

• failure of data suppliers or customers to comply with laws or regulations where mutual compliance is required 

• failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations and 

• failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient cost effective manner 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise adversely affect our business see “item 1 business—governmental regulation” and “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

regulatory oversight of our contractual relationships with certain of our customers may adversely affect our business 

the federal banking agencies including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the cfpb as well as many state banking agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships this guidance requires more rigorous oversight of thirdparty relationships that involve certain “critical activities” in light of this guidance our existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance may continue to revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with us which may adversely affect our relationship with such customers in 2018 we entered into a consent order with certain state banking regulators in response to their multistate review of our information security program this consent order obligates us to among other things make certain changes to our corporate governance and information security practices if we are unable or otherwise fail to comply with this consent order our ability to do business with financial institutions in those states could be impaired it is possible that the consent order or other actions resulting from examinations by federal or state banking regulators could lead to adverse changes in our customer relationships 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales outside the us comprised 27 of our total revenue in 2019 as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

• changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions 

• trade protection measures 

• data privacy and consumer protection laws and regulations 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations 

• business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions 

• difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner 

• implementation of exchange controls 

• geopolitical instability including terrorism and war 

• foreign currency changes 

• increased travel infrastructure legal and compliance costs of multiple international locations 

• foreign laws and regulatory requirements 

• terrorist activity natural disasters pandemics and other catastrophic events 

• restrictions on the import and export of technologies 

• difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable 

• longer payment cycles 

• failure to meet quality standards for outsourced work 

• unfavorable tax rules 

• the presence and acceptance of varying level of business corruption in international markets and 

• varying business practices in foreign countries 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the argentine peso the chilean peso the euro the new zealand dollar the costa rican colon the singapore dollar the brazilian real the russian ruble and the indian rupee because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against major currencies will affect our operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits both individual and class action against us alleging a violation of the fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years 

we rely in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial operating results or it and data security profile we expect in addition if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances our growth may be adversely impacted 

historically we have relied in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business any acquisitions we do complete may not be on favorable terms and the expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies it systems and personnel into our operations it and data security profiles of acquired companies may not meet our technological standards and may take longer to integrate and remediate than planned this may result in significantly greater transaction remediation and integration costs for future acquisitions than we have experienced historically or it could mean that we will not pursue certain acquisitions where the costs of integration and remediation are too significant we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence and acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside of the us will increase our exposure to risks of conducting operations in international markets these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

despite our past experience opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances may not be available to us in the future in addition our focus on data security and our technology transformation strategy including our migration to cloudbased technologies may limit our ability to identify and complete acquisitions as we will have less time and resources to devote to identifying suitable acquisition candidates and our technological criteria and standards for acquisition candidates may increase 

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our technology transformation we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels including with respect to data and system security or increase prices for their services to unreasonable levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unrealized efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition some of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competitiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws in december 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” which significantly impacted our us and global tax expense and net income and our earnings per share in 2018 and 2019 the irs issued clarification notices and the us treasury issued proposed regulation which also provided clarity to the tax act however the irs could issue additional clarification and additional changes could be made to the final issuance of the regulations 

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state and local governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting following the 2017 cybersecurity incident our government contracts received enhanced scrutiny and negative media attention that resulted in the suspension of one of our contracts if we experience another material cybersecurity incident our ability to maintain our existing and acquire new government contracts may be substantially impacted 

also the government programs to which we provide services or which are the bases of compliance services we provide nongovernmental clients including in particular the employer requirements under the affordable care act may be terminated or substantially altered by the government and our services would no longer be needed if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work if the services we provide are no longer needed due to government program change or termination or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

there has been substantial litigation in the us regarding intellectual property rights in the information technology industry from time to time third parties claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to each such claim on a case by case basis a dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property can be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the inherent uncertainty of intellectual property litigation could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations and we may not prevail a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all although our policy is to obtain licenses or other rights where necessary we cannot provide assurance that we have obtained all required licenses or rights 

third parties may misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as contract restrictions confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to devote significant resources including cybersecurity resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect misappropriation or infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect misappropriation or infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because a third party has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

the uk’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the uk’s withdrawal from the eu referred to as “brexit” including implications for the free flow of labor and goods in the uk and the eu and other financial legal tax and trade implications brexit could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business in the uk including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations in addition developments regarding brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers particularly those who do business in the uk to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

we may not be able to borrow under our revolving credit facility and receivables facility 

we are party to a 2250 million receivables funding facility the “receivables facility” as well as the 110 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolver” our revolver and receivables facility have representations covenants financial covenants and events of default which may limit our ability to borrow under such debt obligations any breach of a representation or failure to comply with any covenant or financial covenant or the occurrence of any event of default under the revolver or the receivables facility could result in a prohibition of further borrowings under the revolver and receivables facility or acceleration of any obligations outstanding thereunder any event of default under the revolver or receivables facility could result in a cross default under our other outstanding debt obligations 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income 

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success including our ability to implement our technology transformation strategy depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations such as it and data security which require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business as part of our technology transformation strategy we have hired a significant number of new employees and contract workers hiring training motivating retaining and managing employees with the skills required is timeconsuming and expensive there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees if we are not able to hire sufficient employees to support our technology transformation or to train motivate retain and manage the employees we do hire it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results 

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and postretirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to other risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business in our industry 

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business as a global data analytics and technology company these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our products and services technological changes rising costs of employment costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business in our industry

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

litigation and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident   

following the 2017 cybersecurity incident hundreds of class actions and other lawsuits were filed against us typically alleging harm from the 2017 cybersecurity incident and seeking various remedies including monetary and injunctive relief we were also subject to investigations and inquiries by federal state and foreign governmental agencies and officials regarding the 2017 cybersecurity incident and related matters as described below most of these lawsuits and government investigations have concluded or been resolved including pursuant to the settlement agreements described below while others remain ongoing the company’s participation in these settlements does not constitute an admission by the company of any fault or liability and the company does not admit fault or liability 

consumer settlement 

on july 19 2019 and july 22 2019 we entered into multiple agreements that resolve the us consolidated consumer class action cases captioned in re equifax inc customer data security breach litigation mdl no 2800 consumer cases the “us consumer mdl litigation” and the investigations of the ftc the cfpb the msag group and the nydfs collectively the “consumer settlement” under the terms of the consumer settlement the company will contribute 3805 million to a nonreversionary settlement fund the “consumer restitution fund” to provide restitution for us consumers identified by the company whose personal information was compromised as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

the consumer restitution fund will be used to 1 compensate affected consumers for certain unreimbursed costs or expenditures incurred by affected consumers that are fairly traceable to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 2 provide affected consumers with an opportunity to enroll in at least four years of credit monitoring services provided by a third party unaffiliated with the company or alternative compensation for affected consumers who already have other credit monitoring services 3 provide affected consumers with additional benefits such as identity restoration services and 4 pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs and expenses for the plaintiffs’ counsel in the us consumer mdl litigation not to exceed 805 million and administrative and notice costs 

the company has agreed to contribute up to an additional 1250 million to the consumer restitution fund to cover unreimbursed costs and expenditures described in 1 above in the event the 3805 million in the consumer restitution fund is exhausted 

in accordance with the terms of the consumer settlement in the third quarter of 2019 the company paid 1805 million to the msag group and the following monetary penalties 1 1000 million to the cfpb and 2 100 million to the nydfs as part of the consumer settlement the company also agreed to implement certain business practice commitments related to consumer assistance and its information security program including conducting third party assessments of its information security program 

in the third quarter of 2019 the agreements with the ftc and cfpb were approved by the us district court for the northern district of georgia the settlement with the msag group which consists of substantially similar agreements with each of the participating jurisdictions was approved by courts in the relevant jurisdiction also in the third quarter of 2019 

on january 13 2020 the northern district of georgia the us district court overseeing centralized pretrial proceedings for the us consumer mdl litigation and numerous other federal court actions relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the “mdl court” entered an order granting final approval of the settlement in connection with the us consumer mdl litigation from which several objectors have appealed until the appeals are finally adjudicated or dismissed we can provide no assurance that the us consumer mdl litigation will be resolved as contemplated by the settlement agreement if the mdl court’s order approving the settlement were reversed by an appellate court there is a risk that we would not be able to settle the us consumer mdl litigation on acceptable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

nations the company has reached an agreement in principle to resolve the three indian tribes’ claims as well as an agreement in principle to resolve the city of chicago’s lawsuit 

other matters 

we face other lawsuits and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident that have not yet been concluded or resolved these ongoing matters may result in judgments fines or penalties settlements or other relief we dispute the allegations in the remaining lawsuits and intend to defend against such claims set forth below are descriptions of the main categories of these matters 

georgia state court consumer class actions four putative class actions arising from the 2017 cybersecurity incident were filed against us in fulton county superior court and fulton county state court in georgia based on similar allegations and theories as alleged in the us consumer mdl litigation and seek monetary damages injunctive relief and other related relief on behalf of georgia citizens these cases were transferred to a single judge in the fulton county business court and three of the cases were consolidated into a single action on july 27 2018 the fulton county business court granted the company’s motion to stay the remaining single case and on august 17 2018 the fulton county business court granted the company’s motion to stay the consolidated case these cases remain stayed pending resolution of the us consumer mdl litigation 

canadian class actions eight canadian class actions six of which are on behalf of a national class of approximately 19000 canadian consumers have been filed against us in ontario saskatchewan quebec british columbia and alberta each of the proposed canadian class actions asserts a number of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and other related relief in connection with the 2017 cybersecurity incident the plaintiffs in each case seek class certificationauthorization on behalf of canadian consumers whose personal information was allegedly impacted by the 2017 cybersecurity incident in some cases plaintiffs also seek class certification on behalf of a larger group of canadian consumers who had contracts for subscription products with equifax around the time of the incident or earlier and were not impacted by the incident 

on october 21 2019 the court in the quebec case dismissed the plaintiff’s motion for authorization to institute a class action on december 13 2019 the court in the active ontario case granted certification of a nationwide class that includes impacted canadians as well as canadians who had subscription products with equifax between march 7 2017 and july 30 2017 we have sought leave to appeal this decision all remaining purported class actions are at preliminary stages in addition one of the cases in ontario as well as the saskatchewan case have been stayed the court’s order staying the saskatchewan case is on appeal 

individual consumer litigation we have several hundred individual consumer actions pending against us in state general jurisdiction and small claims and federal courts across the us related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the plaintiffsclaimants in these cases have generally claimed to have been harmed by alleged actions andor omissions by equifax in connection with the 2017 cybersecurity incident and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking primarily monetary damages where possible actions filed in or removed to federal court were noticed for transfer to the mdl court we believe that many of the remaining individual consumer actions will be subject to the settlement in the us consumer mdl litigation discussed above unless the individual consumers submitted a valid and timely request to be excluded from the settlement 

government investigations we have cooperated with federal state and foreign governmental agencies and officials investigating or otherwise seeking information testimony andor documents regarding the 2017 cybersecurity incident and related matters 

the fca opened an enforcement investigation against our uk subsidiary equifax limited in october 2017 the investigation by the fca has involved a number of information requirements and interviews we continue to respond to the information requirements and are cooperating with the investigation 

the new york state attorney general investor protection bureau “ipb” issued a subpoena in september 2017 relating to its investigation of whether there has been a violation of the martin act we have cooperated with the ipb in its investigation and the ipb has not contacted us regarding the investigation since january 2019 

although we continue to cooperate in the above investigations and inquiries an adverse outcome to any such investigations and inquiries could subject us to fines or other obligations which may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business or our results of operations 

accc investigation

consolidated financial results 

  

operating revenue 



  

revenue for 2019 increased by 3 compared to 2018 the growth was driven by our workforce solutions and usis segments which was partially offset by declines in international and global consumer solutions workforce solutions saw strong growth driven by verification services usis growth was primarily driven by increases in core credit decisioning volumes and revenue from acquisitions international had local currency growth across latin america and canada the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 747 million or 2 in 2019 compared to 2018 global consumer solutions revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in consumer direct revenue in the us and the uk

operating expenses 



  

cost of services cost of services increased 813 million in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase is due to increased royalty and technology costs we also incurred increased incremental technology and data security costs of 203 million in 

2019 these increased technology and security costs predominantly reflect the investments we are making in our technology transformation which include costs for enhanced data security we expect these incremental costs as well as increased ongoing technology and security costs to continue in 2020 the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 332 million 

cost of services increased 2297 million in 2018 compared to 2017 we incurred increased technology and data security costs of 1465 million in 2018 these increased technology and security costs predominantly reflect the investments we are making in our technology transformation which include costs for enhanced data security the remaining increase is due to increased people and royalty costs the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 64 million 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 7769 million in 2019 compared to 2018 

the increase in 2019 is primarily due to losses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 244 million 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1813 million in 2018 as compared to 2017 

we incurred increased incremental technology and data security costs of 1607 million in 2018 as was the case in cost of services these increased technology and security costs predominately reflect the investments we are making in our technology transformation which include costs for enhanced data security the remaining changes were driven by increases due to the restructuring charge of 461 million people the public records litigation settlement of 185 million and insurance costs which were partially offset by decreased advertising costs the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 102 million 

  

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for 2019 and 2018 increased by 207 million and 226 million respectively the increase is due to amortization of capitalized internaluse software and systems costs and depreciation of production equipment partially offset by a decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles 

  

operating income and operating margin 



  

total company operating margin decreased in 2019 versus 2018 primarily due to losses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident which are reflected in selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of loss income 

total company operating margin decreased in 2018 versus 2017 primarily due to the aforementioned technology and data security spending by the company after the 2017 cybersecurity incident of 3262 million reflected in costs of services and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of loss income 

interest expense and other income expense net 



  

interest expense increased in 2019 when compared to 2018 due to an increase in our overall debt outstanding during the year due to borrowings on our receivables facility and under our commercial paper program these borrowings were paid down with the proceeds from the issuance of the 7500 million senior notes in november 2019 

interest expense increased in 2018 when compared to 2017 due to an increase in our overall average cost of debt resulting from the issuance of the 360 floating rate and 395 senior notes in may 2018 

the increase in other income net in 2019 is primarily due to higher earnings on certain equity method investments and partially offset by an increased loss related to the foreign exchange impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of argentina becoming a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes starting in july 2018 

the increase in other income net in 2018 is primarily due to higher earnings on certain equity method investments an increase in interest income and the release of a liability from a past acquisition these increases were partially offset by increased pension expense and the foreign exchange impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of argentina becoming a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes in 2018 

income taxes 



  

our effective tax rate was 93 for 2019 down from 140 for the same period in 2018 our effective tax rate is lower for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 due to the operating loss of the company in 2019 and permanent tax differences resulting from certain nondeductible amounts related to the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

  

our effective tax rate was 140 for 2018 down from 199 for the same period in 2017 the decrease in our effective income tax rate is due to the decrease in the statutory us tax rate as a result of the tax act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the increase in the benefit received from the reversal of uncertain tax positions these changes were offset by an increase in the impact of equity compensation an increase in the foreign rate differential impact and the deferred tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the impact of the tax act 

net loss income 



  

consolidated net loss income decreased by 6991 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to decreased operating income primarily driven by losses net of insurance recoveries associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident of 8009 million

revenue decreased 8 for 2018 in reported and local currency revenue as compared to 2017 the decrease in revenue is due to a decrease in our consumer direct revenue in the us as we ceased advertising our consumer paid products in the us in september 2017 following the 2017 cybersecurity incident and the uk as we were impacted by the global data protection regulations in the uk these decreases were partially offset by an increase in our partner revenue which includes revenue from the id watchdog acquisition we resumed advertising our us consumer paid products in the fourth quarter of 2018 local currency fluctuations against the us dollar positively impacted revenue by 12 million for 2018 

operating margin decreased in 2018 to 184 compared to 264 in 2017 due to the decreased revenue and an increase in incremental technology and data security costs which were partially offset by decreased advertising costs 

general corporate expense 



  

our general corporate expenses are unallocated costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction including shared services technology administrative legal restructuring and the portion of management incentive compensation determined by total companywide performance 

general corporate expense increased 7894 million in 2019 the increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily due to losses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

general corporate expense increased 1888 million in 2018 we incurred increased incremental technology and data security costs following the announcement of the 2017 cybersecurity incident of 1867 million in 2018 this was partially offset by a decrease in legal and investigative fees and the costs to fulfill and support the free credit monitoring service provided to eligible consumers of 752 million in 2018 further we benefited from an increase in the recognition of insurance proceeds of 750 million to offset these costs in 2018 versus the 500 million of insurance proceeds recorded in 2017 additionally we recorded 461 million of restructuring charges in 2018 which primarily relate to a reduction of headcount the remaining increase is due to people and insurance costs 

liquidity and financial condition 

  

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities remain in a strong financial position and manage our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

funds generated by operating activities our revolver and related commercial paper program and our receivables facility more fully described below are our most significant sources of liquidity the company has and expects to make payments to resolve certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident described more fully in “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k in 2019 the company made payments of 3415 million principally related to the consumer settlement comprised of 1805 million to the msag group 1000 million to the cfpb 252 million to the consumer restitution fund and 100 million to the nydfs the remaining 3553 million to be paid to the consumer restitution fund will be made after a final adjudication affirming the us consumer mdl litigation settlement or dismissal of the pending appeals although we expect this payment and the remaining settlement payments to be made in 2020 we can give no assurance that these payments will occur in 2020 due to pending approvals or appeals as a result of the possible payments that could be made in 2020 related to the losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident funds generated by operating activities are not expected to be sufficient to fund working capital and other cash requirements throughout 2020 our plan is to finance the payments with existing borrowing capacity including under our revolver at december 31 2019 110 billion was available to borrow under our revolver as of december 31 2019 2217 million was available to borrow under our receivables facility in the event that additional financing is needed we would finance using the public and private corporate bond markets andor syndicated loan markets if available 

fund transfer limitations the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to the us may be limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends as of december 31 2019 we held 1546 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries 

information about our cash flows by category is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 



  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for 2019 decreased by 3584 million compared to 2018 the decrease is due to partial payment of the losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident as well as having received 1100 million in insurance proceeds in 2018 

cash provided by operating activities for 2018 decreased by 1438 million compared to 2017 due to the decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization this decrease was partially offset by an improvement in our working capital and the change in deferred income taxes 

  

investing activities 



amounts above are total cash outflows for capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance licensing of standard software applications investing in system reliability security and disaster recovery enhancements and updating or expanding our office facilities 

capital expenditures increased in 2019 and 2018 from 2018 and 2017 respectively due to our ongoing technology transformation

for additional information about our acquisitions see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

financing activities 



  

borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm repayments borrowings primarily represent repayments or borrowings of outstanding amounts under our commercial paper “cp” program we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and as availability allows 

  

the decrease in net shortterm repayments borrowings in 2019 and 2018 and the increase in 2017 primarily relates to the net activity of cp notes 

the increase in proceeds from longterm debt in 2019 relates to the issuance of 7500 million in senior notes in november 2019 and draw downs on our receivable facility during the year 

in november 2019 we issued 7500 million aggregate principal amount of 26 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 notes” in an underwritten public offering interest on the 2024 notes accrue at a rate of 26 per year and will be payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning on june 1 2020 the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and our cp program and for general corporate purposes 

the increase in proceeds from longterm debt in 2018 relates to the issuance of 10 billion of senior notes in may 2018 

in may 2018 we issued 3000 million aggregate principal amount of 36 senior notes due 2021 the “2021 notes” 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 395 senior notes due 2023 the “2023 notes” and 3000 million aggregate principal amount floating rate notes due 2021 the “floating rate notes” in an underwritten public offering the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolver our prior 8000 million threeyear delayed draw term loan facility “term loan” and our cp program 

the increase in proceeds from longterm debt in 2017 is due to borrowings on our revolver 

payments on longterm debt in 2019 reflect payments on our receivable facility using proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in 2019 payments on longterm debt in 2018 reflect 1000 million of payments on the revolver using proceeds from the issuance of 360 floating rate and 395 senior notes in 2018 payments on longterm debt in 2017 reflect 2725 million of payments related to senior notes as well as 500 million of payments on the term loan 

credit facility availability in september 2018 the company entered into the 110 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions which will mature in september 2023 the “revolver” the revolver replaced the company’s previous 9000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in november 2020 borrowings under the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs the revolver has an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitment to 160 billion the revolver includes an option to request a maximum of two oneyear extensions of the maturity date any time after the first anniversary of the revolver closing we believe we are currently in compliance with all representations and warranties necessary as a condition for borrowing under the revolver but we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all such conditions to borrowing in the future availability of the revolver is reduced by the outstanding principal balance of our commercial paper notes and by any letters of credit issued under the facility 

our 110 billion cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our revolver and the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver 

  

at december 31 2019 the company had no borrowings outstanding of cp 07 million of letters of credit outstanding and no borrowings outstanding under the revolver at december 31 2019 a total of 110 billion was available under the revolver 

  

at december 31 2019 approximately 91 of our debt was fixed rate and 9 was variable rate our variablerate debt consists of the floating rate notes the interest rate resets periodically based on the terms of the respective financing arrangement at december 31 2019 the interest rate on our variablerate debt was 28 

in december 2019 we amended our 2250 million receivables funding facility the “receivables facility” to extend the maturity to december 2022 in the fourth quarter of 2017 equifax entered into the receivables facility which had an original maturity in 2019 and was amended in november 2018 to extend the maturity to november 2020 under the receivables facility equifax and certain of its us subsidiaries sell the eligible thirdparty receivables of its us based business to equifax receivables funding llc a consolidated whollyowned bankruptcyremote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer without recourse an undivided interest in these accounts receivable to investors the investors have no recourse to the company’s other assets except for customary repurchase warranty and indemnity claims creditors of equifax do not have recourse to the assets of equifax receivables funding llc 

debt covenants a downgrade in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and revolver and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on mortgages liens and saleleaseback transactions in addition the revolver requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 as permitted under the terms of the revolver we made the election to increase the covenant to 40 to 10 effective for four consecutive quarters beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing through the first quarter of 2020 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2019 the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

  

the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however the 23 senior notes due 2021 36 senior notes due 2021 the floating rate notes 33 senior notes due 2022 395 senior notes due 2023 26 senior notes due 2024 325 senior notes due 2026 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the “senior notes” contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announces the company’s intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s “sp” and moody’s investors service “moody’s” below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2019 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb with a negative outlook for sp and baa1 with a negative outlook for moody’s a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and revolver and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment these ratings are subject to change as events and circumstances change

equity transactions 



  

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 were as follows 

  

• we did not repurchase any shares in 2019 and 2018 under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors we repurchased 05 million common shares during the twelve months ended december 31 2017 for 771 million at an average price per common share of 14388 as of december 31 2019 under the existing board authorization the company is approved for additional stock repurchases of 5901 million 

• during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we paid cash dividends to equifax shareholders of 1887 million 1879 million and 1874 million respectively at 156 per share for 2019 2018 and 2017 

we anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends the actual amount of such dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors and will depend upon future earnings results of operations capital requirements our financial condition and other relevant factors there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at current levels or at all 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2019 the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 



1 the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling 205 million at december 31 2019 total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments there were no fair value adjustments to our debt at december 31 2019 

2 our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment 

3 these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions and certain administrative functions these agreements expire between 2020 and 2026 

4 these longterm liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension postretirement and other compensationrelated plans some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments in the table above we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations as such required funding amounts beyond 2019 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance 

5 this table excludes 246 million of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 

6 for future interest payments on variablerate debt which bears a rate equal to threemonth libor on the interest determination date plus 087 per annum we used the variable rate in effect at december 31 2019 to calculate these payments our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2019 consisted of the floating rate notes the variable rate at december 31 2019 was 28 future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates 

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1564 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards related to the assets remain with the company 

  

letters of credit and guarantees 

  

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance or surety bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2019 and generally have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2019 

  

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan “usrip” that covers approximately 11 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was closed to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a retirement plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution components that cover most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan “crip” the defined benefit component was also closed to new hires on october 1 2011 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip and made contributions of 02 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2018 we made voluntary contributions of 300 million to the usrip and made contributions of 04 million to the crip at december 31 2019 the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets statements of loss income and statements of comprehensive loss income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

  

in accordance with asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” we recognize revenue when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer and the customer obtains control of the good or service in order to recognize revenue we note that the two parties must have an agreement that creates enforceable rights the performance obligations must be distinct and the transaction price can be determined our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transactional basis in which distinct services are delivered over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services delivered to measure our performance over time the output method is utilized to measure the value to the customer based on the transfer to date of the services promised with no rights of return once consumed in these cases revenue on transactional contracts with a defined price but an undefined quantity is recognized utilizing the right to invoice expedient resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed additionally multiyear contracts with defined pricing but an undefined quantity that utilize tier pricing would be defined as a series of distinct performance obligations satisfied over time utilizing the same method of measurement the output method with no rights of return once consumed this measurement method is applied on a monthly basis resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed 

additionally we recognize revenue from subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue from subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are delivered any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue from subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term multiyear subscription contracts are analyzed to determine the full contract transaction price over the term of the contract and the subsequent price is ratably recognized over the full term of the contract 

revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment from the customer if there is uncertainty as to the 

customer’s acceptance of the performance obligation revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 

we sell certain offerings that contain multiple performance obligations these obligations may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services in order to account for each of these obligations separately the delivered promises within our contracts must meet the criterion to be considered distinct performance obligations to our customer if we determine that the arrangement does not contain separate distinct obligations the performance obligations are bundled together until a distinct obligation is achieved this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract obligation is delivered to our customer or ratably over the term of the contract 

some of our arrangements with multiple performance obligations involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the installation of interfaces or platforms by our technology personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these installation services do not meet the requirement for being distinct thus any related installation fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related services revenue from the delivery of onetime files and models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of installation of a customer are capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the identifiable asset 

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction and therefore do not have control 

  

in certain instances within our debt collections and recovery management services in our international operating segment and certain tax management services within our workforce solutions operating segment variable consideration is constrained due to the fact that the revenue is contingent on a particular outcome within our debt collections and recovery management businesses revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the debt is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit approval from a regulatory agency or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

certain costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of a performance obligation are deferred as contract costs and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of transfer of the related goods and services these costs generally consist of labor costs directly relating to the implementation and setup of the contract 

judgments and uncertainties – each performance obligation within a contract must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these distinct goods or services these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its standalone selling price concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectability and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

contract balances – the contract balances are generated when revenue recognized varies from billing in a given period a contract asset is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes more revenue than what has been billed as of december 31 2019 the contract asset balance was 81 million a contract liability is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes less than what has been billed deferred revenue is recognized when we have an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer and have already received consideration from the customer we generally expect to recognize our deferred revenue as revenue within twelve months of being recorded based on the terms of the contracts 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have seven reporting units comprised of usis 

which includes online information solutions mortgage solutions and financial marketing services asia pacific europe latin america canada global consumer solutions “gcs” and equifax workforce solutions which includes verification services and employer services 

  

the goodwill balance at december 31 2019 for our seven reporting units was as follows 



valuation techniques 

we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our usis europe latin america canada gcs and workforce solutions reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units 

  

we performed a quantitative assessment for our asia pacific reporting unit to determine whether impairment exists as the veda transaction which comprises the majority of our asia pacific reporting unit was only completed approximately three years ago and due to the size of the cushion for the reporting unit in relation to our other reporting units in determining the fair value of the reporting unit we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value 

  

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies or guideline transactions we believe the benchmark companies used for our asia pacific reporting unit serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our discussion of competition in item 1 of this form 10k competition for our asia pacific reporting unit generally includes global consumer credit reporting companies such as experian which offer a product suite similar to the reporting unit’s credit reporting solutions 

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

  

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of our last annual impairment test 

growth assumptions 

  

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion  analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of our asia pacific reporting unit was 485 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 

we projected revenue growth in 2020 for our asia pacific reporting unit in completing our 2019 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by this unit and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth the anticipated revenue growth in this reporting unit however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for the reporting unit which reflects the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth 

  

discount rate assumptions 

  

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows for the reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2019 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rate used to develop the estimated fair value of the asia pacific reporting unit was 91 

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

  

the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for our asia pacific reporting unit exceeded the related carrying value as of september 30 2019 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value our asia pacific reporting unit primarily represents our recently completed acquisition of veda due to the recency of this acquisition and its overall significance to the reporting unit asia pacific is more sensitive to changes in the assumptions noted above that could result in a fair value that is less than its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit as of september 30 2019 was 14 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote 

in the third quarter of 2017 we announced a cybersecurity incident potentially impacting us canadian and uk consumers as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we were subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k we recorded expenses net of insurance recoveries of 8009 million in other current liabilities and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of loss income respectively as of and for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 

exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses the amount accrued represents our best estimate of the liability related to these matters the company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with asc 4502025 while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued may be incurred it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations described in “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k based on a number of factors such as the various stages of these proceedings and investigations including matters on appeal that alleged damages have not been specified or are uncertain the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class as applicable and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues the ultimate amount paid on these actions claims and investigations in excess of the amount already accrued could be material to the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

judgments and uncertainties — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — with the exception of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

  

income taxes 

  

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2019 246 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 50 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

  

pension and other postretirement plans 

  

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

during 2019 we adopted the new pri2012 mortality tables and mp2019 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the us plans the updated mortality tables and projection scale partially offset the decrease in the discount rates in 2019 the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2019 

during 2018 we adopted the new mp2018 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the us plans this updated scale along with the change in the discount rates contributed to a decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018 

during 2017 we adopted the new mp2017 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the us plans this updated scale partially offset the decrease in the discount rates in 2017 the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017 

judgments and uncertainties — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analyses specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions to determine the discount rate for our us pension and postretirement benefit plans we use a bond matching approach to select specific bonds that would satisfy our projected benefit payments we believe the bond matching approach reflects the process we would employ to settle our pension and postretirement benefit obligations for our canadian plans we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 

  

in 2019 the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the termination of the plan the crip will be frozen effective december 31 2020 at which date all active members accruing defined benefits shall cease such accruals the obligation is expected to be settled in 2022 with lump sum distributions and an annuity purchase 

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2019 our us pension plan investment earned 214 which was above the expected return of 67 the expected return for the usrip for 2020 is 65 following asset allocation changes that resulted in higher allocation to fixed income securities the crip investment earned 127 in 2019 versus the expected return of 60 the expected return for the crip for 2020 is 60 our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2019 is 646 which is consistent with the 2019 expected rate 

  

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5637 million at december 31 2019 we do not expect our 2020 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2019 cost see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 646 at december 31 2019 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2019 by approximately 28 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 439 at december 31 2019 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2019 by approximately 11 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense pension liability or unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gains losses that could be material 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of loss income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2019 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2019 would have increased our revenue by 548 million and our pretax operating profit by 102 million for the year ended december 31 2018 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2018 would have increased our revenue by 559 million and our pretax operating profit by 107 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2019 and 2018 

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2019 were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2019 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2020 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2020 and rates could go either higher or lower 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper revolver and floating rate notes borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2019 our weighted average cost of debt was 38 and weightedaverage life of debt was 454 years at december 31 2019 91 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 9 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2019 interest expense by 30 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

2017 cybersecurity incident 

in 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers criminals exploited a software vulnerability in a us website application to gain unauthorized access to our network in march 2017 the us department of homeland security distributed a notice concerning the software vulnerability we undertook efforts to identify and remediate vulnerable 

systems however the vulnerability in the website application that was exploited was not identified by our security processes we discovered unusual network activity in latejuly 2017 and upon discovery promptly investigated the activity once the activity was identified as potential unauthorized access we acted to stop the intrusion and engaged a leading independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensic investigation to determine the scope of the unauthorized access including the specific information impacted based on our forensic investigation the unauthorized access occurred from midmay 2017 through july 2017 no evidence was found that the company’s core consumer employment and income or commercial reporting databases were accessed we continue to cooperate with law enforcement in connection with the criminal investigation into the actors responsible for the 2017 cybersecurity incident

workforce solutions 

  

workforce solutions operates in the us through two business units 

  

verification services   verification services include employment and income verification services our online verification services enable thirdparty verifiers including various governmental agencies mortgage originators credit card and automotive lenders and preemployment screeners to verify the employee’s employment status and income information we also offer an offline manual verification service which expands employment verification to locate data outside our existing automated database 

  

employer services   these services are aimed at reducing the cost to the human resources function of businesses through a broad suite of services including assisting with employment tax matters designed to reduce the cost of unemployment claims through effective claims representation and management and efficient processing and to better manage the tax rate that employers are assessed for unemployment taxes comprehensive services designed to research the availability of employmentrelated tax credits eg federal work opportunity tax credits and to process the necessary filings and assist the client in obtaining the tax credit w2 management services which include initial distribution reissue and correction of w2 forms paperless pay services that enable employees to electronically receive pay statement information as well as review and change direct deposit account or w4 information i9 management services designed to help clients electronically comply with the immigration laws that require employers to complete an i9 form for each new hire and onboarding services using online forms to complete the new hire process for employees of corporate and government agencies in addition we provide software and services to employers to assist in their compliance with the affordable care act “aca” 

the work number ®    the work number is our key repository of employment and income data serving our verification services business unit and enabling our employer services business unit we rely on payroll data received from tens of thousands of organizations to regularly update the database the updates occur as employers and other data contributors transmit data electronically to equifax from their payroll systems employers provide this data to us so that we can handle verification requests on behalf of each employer we use this data to provide automated employment and income verification services to thirdparty verifiers 

  

the fees we charge for services in these two business units are generally on a per transaction basis we have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the database because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to the work number ®  database and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to thirdparty employment verification requests the work number ®   database is approaching 380 million current and historic employment records at december 31 2018  

workforce solutions is in the process of building income and employment verification service businesses in canada and australia including establishing the work number ®  in each country at present revenues from these services in canada and australia are insignificant

seasonality 

  

we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated by the online consumer information services component of our usis operating segment is typically the lowest during the first quarter when consumer lending activity is at a seasonal low revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue generated from our financial wealth asset products and data management services in our financial marketing services business is generally higher in the fourth quarter each year due to the significant portion of our annual renewals and deliveries which occur in the fourth quarter of each year mortgage related revenue is generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year due to the increase in consumer home purchasing during the summer in the us 

competition 

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change our competitors vary widely in size and in the nature of the products and services they offer sources of competition are numerous and include the following 

 

 

 

 

while we believe that none of our competitors offers the same mix of products and services as we do certain competitors may have a larger share of particular geographic or product markets or operate in geographic areas where we do not currently have a presence

 item 1a risk factors 

  

all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10k should be considered and read carefully the risks described below are not the only ones facing us the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below 

security breaches like the 2017 cybersecurity incident and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could compromise company consumer and customer information interfere with our operations cause us to incur significant costs for remediation and enhancement of our it systems and expose us to legal liability all of which could have a substantial negative impact on our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we collect process transmit and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of consumers the secure operation of our information technology networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training and contractual precautions our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access to data or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct attacks by hackers employee or insider malfeasance andor human error 

in 2017 we were the target of a cybersecurity attack that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of approximately 1455 million us consumers approximately 19000 canadian consumers and approximately 860000 uk consumers in addition we identified approximately 24 million us consumers whose name and partial driver’s license information were stolen in the attack while the forensic analysis of the 2017 cybersecurity incident is complete it is possible that further analysis will identify additional consumers affected or additional types of data accessed which could result in additional notifications and negative publicity 

following the 2017 cybersecurity incident we began undertaking significant remediation efforts and other steps to enhance our data security infrastructure which are ongoing in connection with these efforts we have incurred significant costs and expect to incur additional significant costs as we continue to enhance our data security infrastructure and take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and the data we maintain despite these efforts we cannot assure you that all potential causes of this incident have been identified and remediated and that similar cyber incidents will not occur in the future 

because our products and services involve the storage and transmission of personal information of consumers we will continue to routinely be the target of attempted cyber and other security threats by outside third parties including technically sophisticated and wellresourced bad actors attempting to access or steal the data we store as we transition to cloudbased technologies we may be exposed to additional cyber threats as we migrate our data from our legacy systems to cloudbased solutions our increased dependence on third parties to store our cloudbased data systems may also subject us to further cyber threats insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern for all companies including ours in addition the 2017 cybersecurity incident may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems 

we must continuously plan develop and monitor our information technology networks and infrastructure to identify protect detect respond to and recover from the risk of unauthorized access misuse malware phishing and other events that could have a security impact if we experience additional breaches of our security measures including from incidents that we fail to detect for a period of time sensitive data may be accessed stolen disclosed or lost any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to significant additional litigation regulatory fines penalties losses of customers or reputational damage any of which could have a significant negative impact on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations 

we cannot ensure that our insurance policies in the future will be adequate to cover losses from any future failures our 1250 million cybersecurity insurance policy was not adequate to cover the losses we have incurred to date from the 2017 cybersecurity incident and all future losses we incur as a result of the incident will not be covered by insurance in addition our insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 

the government investigations and litigation resulting from the 2017 cybersecurity incident will continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations  

as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we are currently a party to a consolidated multidistrict consumer class action lawsuit and a consolidated multidistrict financial institution class action lawsuit as well as a consolidated securities class action lawsuit shareholder derivative litigation and other lawsuits and claims arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident seeking monetary damages or other relief a number of us federal state local and foreign governmental officials and agencies including congressional committees the ftc the cfpb the sec the us department of justice and state attorneys general offices in the us the fca in the uk and the office of the privacy commissioner in canada continue to investigate events related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident including how it occurred the consequences thereof and our response thereto while we believe it is beneficial to resolve the consolidated multidistrict consumer class action and one or more of the government investigations in the us through a global resolution the complexity of achieving a multiparty resolution especially involving multiple government agencies makes this a difficult objective to achieve we may not have success in achieving a global resolution or even a resolution of any of these matters individually in addition other lawsuits investigations and reports related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident may be filed commenced or issued the claims and investigations have resulted in the incurrence of significant external and internal legal costs and expenses and reputational damage to our business and are expected to continue throughout 2019 and beyond the resolution of these matters may result in damages costs fines or penalties substantially in excess of our insurance coverage which depending on the amount could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or compliance with our credit agreements if such damages costs fines or penalties were great enough that we could not pay them through funds generated from operating activities andor cause a default under our revolving credit facility we may be forced to renegotiate or obtain a waiver under our revolving credit facility andor seek additional debt or equity financing such renegotiation or financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all in these circumstances if we were unable to obtain sufficient financing we may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due the outcome of such claims and investigations could also adversely affect or cause us to change how we operate our business various governmental agencies investigating the 2017 cybersecurity incident are seeking to impose injunctive relief consent decrees and civil penalties which could among other things impact our ability to collect and use consumer information materially increase our data security costs reduce available resources to invest in technology and innovation andor otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business and put us at a competitive disadvantage any legislative or regulatory changes adopted in reaction to the 2017 cybersecurity incident or other companies’ data breaches could require us to make modifications to the operation of our business that could have an adverse effect andor increase or accelerate our compliance costs furthermore these matters necessitate significant attention by management which may divert the focus of management from the operation of our business resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the 2017 cybersecurity incident and the adverse publicity that followed have had a negative impact on our reputation and our relationships with our customers and we cannot assure that it will not have a longterm effect on our relationships with our customers our revenue and our business   

  

our reputation with consumers and other stakeholders and our customer relationships were damaged following the 2017 cybersecurity incident resulting in a negative impact on our revenue despite our progress made toward repairing our reputation and business relationships if we are unable to demonstrate the security of our systems and the data we maintain and retain the trust of our customers consumers and data suppliers we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business 

additionally following the 2017 cybersecurity incident certain of our international organization for standardization “iso” certifications which specify requirements for establishing implementing operating monitoring reviewing maintaining and improving a documented information security management system were suspended additionally certain of our payment card industry certifications were suspended these certifications including the iso 27001 certification are critical to our business because certain of our current and potential customers and the contracts governing certain customer relationships as well as certain of our data suppliers require us to maintain them as a requirement of doing business in 2018 significant focus was placed on remediation activities in order to obtain iso and payment card industry recertifications we have reacquired three independent isoiec 270012013 certifications representing our corporate uk and canada environments and two of our payment card industry certifications uk and canada in addition we expect to obtain the 

usis and gcs payment card industry recertification in 2019 if we fail to maintain or regain these certifications customers may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business which would negatively affect our revenue 

the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our technology transformation strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results 

we expect our technology transformation strategy including our transition to cloudbased technologies will significantly increase our efficiency and productivity the functionality of our products and services as well as decrease the cost of our systems infrastructure all of which we expect will drive growth and have a positive effect on our business competitive position and results of operations this initiative is a major undertaking as we replace many of our previous operating systems with cloudbased systems this complex multifaceted and extensive initiative will be expensive and may cause material unanticipated problems and expenses if our new systems do not operate as expected we may have to incur significant additional costs to modify them moreover we may experience issues of customer migration as many of our customers may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloudbased technologies 

we cannot assure you that our technology transformation strategy will be beneficial to the extent or within the timeframes expected or that the estimated efficiency cost savings and other improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all market acceptance of cloudbased offerings is affected by a variety of factors including information security reliability performance the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data as well as the customer’s ability to access this data once a contract has expired and consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers if we are unable to correctly respond to these issues we may experience business disruptions damage to our reputation negative publicity diminished customer relationships and other adverse effects on our business even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized there may be consequences internal control issues or business impacts that were not expected our transition and migration to cloudbased technologies may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical legal or other costs 

our technology transformation strategy places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other limited resources 

as part of our technology transformation strategy we are transitioning and migrating our data systems from traditional data centers to cloudbased platforms this initiative will place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance and financial resources and internal financial control and reporting function in addition many of our existing personnel do not have experience with native cloudbased technologies and as a result we have and will continue to hire personnel with such experience this effort will be time consuming and costly our technology transformation strategy requires management time and resources to educate employees and implement new ways of conducting business the dedication of resources to our technology transformation strategy and cloudbased technologies limits the resources we have available to devote to other initiatives or growth opportunities or to invest in the maintenance of our existing internal systems we cannot guarantee that our strategy is the right one or that investments in alternative technologies or other initiatives would not be a better use of our limited resources 

additionally as a result of our migration efforts in connection with our technology transformation strategy we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods reorganization and transition can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our transition to cloudbased technologies could expose us to operational disruptions 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are managed internally within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties as part of our technology transformation strategy we are upgrading the information technology systems used to operate our business and replacing them with cloudbased solutions this transition will require substantial changes to our software and network infrastructure which could lead to system interruptions affect our data systems and further expose us to operational disruptions and cause us to lose customers all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

upon implementation of the new cloudbased solutions much of our information technology systems will consist of outsourced cloudbased infrastructure platform and softwareasaservice solutions not under our direct management or 

control any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our customers we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number ®  financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi and telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange for a variety of reasons including concerns of data furnishers arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use additional security breaches or competitive reasons our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection disclosure or use of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could have a significant negative impact which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share and reputational loss there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

negative changes in general economic conditions including interest rates unemployment rates income home prices investment values and consumer confidence could adversely affect us 

our customers and therefore our business and revenues are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions including the demand and availability of affordable credit and capital the level and volatility of interest rates inflation employment levels consumer confidence and housing demand both inside and outside the us business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity which can be impacted by changes in interest rates bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit are adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth for example in 2018 our revenue was negatively impacted in the us by the weak mortgage market in argentina by the substantial weakening of the economy and local currency in australia by weak real estate and mortgage markets and overall weakness in consumer credit markets 

our customer base suffers when financial markets experience volatility illiquidity and disruption and the potential for increased and continuing disruptions going forward presents considerable risks to our business and revenue high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for many of our products and services and consequently our revenue and results of operations as consumers may postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services or some of our customers may develop products of their own that replace the products they currently purchase from us which would result in lower revenue 

in addition many of our competitors have extensive consumer relationships including relationships with our current and potential customers moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the us mortgage market changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

some of our competitors may choose to sell products that compete with ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as a part of integrated suites given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

our relationships with key longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time many of our material customer agreements can be terminated by the customer for convenience on advance written notice which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to award more business to our competitors 

we also provide our services to business partners who may combine them with their own or other branded services to be offered as a bundle to consumers governmental agencies and businesses in support of fraud or credit protection credit monitoring identity authentication insurance or credit underwriting and collections some of these partners are the largest providers of credit information or identity protection services to the consumer market 

market competition business requirements financial condition and consolidation through mergers or acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand our relationships with our customers and business partners there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers or business partners on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers or business partners the loss of one or more of our major customers or business partners could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner or if the market does not adopt our new services our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process our resources have to be committed to any new products and services before knowing whether the market will adopt the new offerings in addition our management is and will continue to be intensely focused on enhancing our security measures and responding to consumer and customer concerns relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and may not be able to devote sufficient time or resources to new product development which could cause us to be less competitive as compared to our peers lose out on new revenue opportunities and have an adverse effect on our growth and our business 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue in addition governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and global consumer solutions business units recently there also has been an increase in companies offering free or lowcost directtoconsumer credit services such as credit scores reports and monitoring as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to other products and services to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

due to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and our provision of free services to consumers in connection therewith we ceased the advertisement and sale of new products in our directtoconsumer business from september 2017 through october 2018 which resulted in a significant decline in revenue in that business furthermore in late january 2018 we began offering a new credit lock service lock  alert ™  that is free for life and is aimed at empowering us consumers to control access to their equifax credit file directly and quickly from their smartphone or computer additionally effective september 2018 federal law allows consumers to place freezes on their credit files at all credit bureaus including equifax if a significant number of consumers lock or freeze their file our population of data is reduced which could affect our product offerings and value to our customers in our other businesses 

if our systems do not meet customer requirements for response time or high availability or we experience system constraints or failures or our customers do not modify andor upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other harm to our business and reputation 

we depend on reliable stable efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network systems and data centers to provide service to our customers many of the services and systems upon which we rely have been outsourced to third parties in addition many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers these systems and operations and the personnel that support service and operate these systems could be exposed to interruption damage or destruction from power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses denialofservice attacks employee or insider malfeasance human error fire natural disasters war terrorist acts or civil unrest we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner in addition as part of our technology transformation we continue to be intensely focused on enhancing our data security infrastructure and effecting our technology transformation strategy and implementation of those enhancements could result in service interruptions our customers expect high system availability and response time performance as well as a very high degree of system resilience any significant system interruption or series of minor interruptions could result in the loss of customers andor lost revenues lower margins or other significant harm to our business or reputation 

we and our customers are subject to various current laws and governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations including as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection see “item 1 business—governmental regulation” in this form 10k for a summary of the us and foreign consumer and data protection laws and regulations to which we are subject these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business examples of such new laws and regulations include recent amendments to the fcra requiring the provision of free credit freezes to consumers new cybersecurity and other requirements promulgated by the new york department of financial services and the passage of the california consumer protection act furthermore we expect there to be an increased focus on laws and regulations related to our business because of the great public concern in the us with regard to the operation of credit reporting agencies as well as the collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information which was in part heightened by the 2017 cybersecurity incident there are a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us and the president of the united states could act by executive order in addition a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that 

consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use access accuracy and security of such data are possible in the us state laws provide for disparate notification regimes all of which we are subject to further any perception that our practices or products are an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism private class actions reputational harm or claims by regulators which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability 

we devote substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations and requirements in the future we may be subject to significant additional expense to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to investigate defend or remedy actual or alleged violations additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state federal and foreign government examinations of or inquiries of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations and reputational harm it is difficult to predict the impact on our business if we were subject to allegations of having violated existing laws for example in europe the gdpr which includes extensive regulations for certain security incidents could result in fines of up to four percent of annual worldwide “turnover” a measure similar to revenues in the us in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products moreover our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation depend in part on customers’ adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with consumer expectations and regulatory requirements we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise adversely affect our business see “item 1 business—governmental regulation” and “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

regulatory oversight of our contractual relationships with certain of our customers may adversely affect our business 

the federal banking agencies including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the cfpb as well as many state banking agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships this guidance requires more rigorous oversight of thirdparty relationships that involve certain “critical activities” in light of this guidance our existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance may continue to revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with us which may adversely affect our relationship with such customers in 2018 we entered into a consent order with certain state banking regulators in response to their multistate review of our information security program this consent order obligates us to among other things make certain changes to our corporate governance and information security practices if we are unable or otherwise fail to comply with this consent order our ability to do business with financial institutions in those states could be impaired it is possible that the consent order or other actions resulting from examinations by federal or state banking regulators could lead to adverse changes in our customer relationships 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales outside the us comprised 29  of our total revenue in 2018 as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the argentine peso the chilean peso the euro the new zealand dollar the costa rican colon the singapore dollar the brazilian real the russian ruble and the indian rupee because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against major currencies will affect our operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies in 2018 a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the us dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in us dollars see “segment financial results—international—asia pacific” “—europe” “—latin america” and “—canada” and “effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates” in the “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis” in this form 10k because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to what we are currently experiencing due to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits both individual and class action against us alleging a violation of the fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years 

we rely in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial operating results or it and data security profile we expect in addition if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances our growth may be adversely impacted 

historically we have relied in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business any acquisitions we do complete may not be on favorable terms and the expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies it systems and personnel into our operations it and data security profiles of acquired companies may not meet our technological standards and may take longer to integrate and remediate than planned this may result in significantly greater transaction costs for future acquisitions than we have experienced historically or it could mean that we will not pursue certain acquisitions where the costs of integration and remediation are too significant we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence and acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside of the us will increase our exposure to risks of conducting operations in international markets these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

despite our past experience opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances may not be available to us in the future in addition our focus on our technology transformation strategy our migration to cloudbased technologies and potential fines penalties and other costs as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident may limit our ability to identify and complete acquisitions as we will have less time and resources to devote to identifying suitable acquisition candidates and our technological criteria and standards for acquisition candidates may increase 

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels including with respect to data and system security or increase prices for their services to unreasonable levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unrealized efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competitiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our 

results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws in december 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 which significantly impacted our us and global tax expense and net income and our earnings per share in 2018 the irs issued clarification notices and the us treasury issued proposed regulation which also provided clarity to the tax act however the irs could issue additional clarification and additional changes could be made to the final issuance of the regulations 

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting following the 2017 cybersecurity incident our government contracts received enhanced scrutiny and negative media attention that resulted in the suspension of one of our contracts if we are unable to repair the reputational damage caused by the 2017 cybersecurity incident and ensure the security of the data we maintain our ability to maintain our existing and acquire new government contracts may be substantially impacted 

  

also the government programs to which we provide services or which are the bases of compliance services we provide nongovernmental clients including in particular the employer requirements under the affordable care act may be terminated or substantially altered by the government and our services would no longer be needed if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work if the services we provide are no longer needed due to government program change or termination or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

there has been substantial litigation in the us regarding intellectual property rights in the information technology industry from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations and we may not prevail a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all although our policy is to obtain licenses or other rights where necessary we cannot provide assurance that we have obtained all required licenses or rights 

third parties may misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as contract restrictions confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to devote significant resources including cybersecurity resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect misappropriation or infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect misappropriation or infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because a third party has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and 

our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

the uk’s impending departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

the outcome of the 2016 referendum on the uk’s membership in the eu approving the exit of the uk from the eu referred to as “brexit” could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations the effects of any brexit will depend on its terms in addition developments regarding brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 

we are party to a 110 billion fiveyear unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions that matures in september 2023 the “revolver” the revolver replaced the company’s previous 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in november 2020 the cost of borrowing under the revolver and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take that reduce our profitability or that require us to incur additional indebtedness for items such as substantial cash acquisitions significant increases in costs and capital spending in security and it systems significant costs related to settlements of litigation or regulatory requirements or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the revolver negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms or at all negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to borrow under our revolving credit facility and receivables facility 

we are party to a 2250 million  twoyear receivables funding facility the “receivables facility” as well as the revolver our revolver and receivables facility have representations covenants financial covenants and events of default which may limit our ability to borrow under such debt obligations any breach of a representation or failure to comply with any covenant or financial covenant or the occurrence of any event of default under the revolver or the receivables facility could result in a prohibition of further borrowings under the revolver and receivables facility or acceleration of any obligations outstanding thereunder any event of default under the revolver or receivables facility could result in a cross default under our other outstanding debt obligations 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income 

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success including our ability to implement our technology transformation strategy depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations such as it and security which require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business as part of our technology transformation strategy we have hired a significant number of new employees and contract employees hiring training motivating retaining and managing employees with the skills required is timeconsuming and expensive if we are not able to hire sufficient employees to support our technology transformation or to train motivate retain and manage the employees we do hire it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and postretirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

litigation and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident

consolidated financial results 

  

operating revenue 



  

revenue for 2018 increased  by 1   compared to 2017 the growth was driven by our workforce solutions and international segments which was partially offset by declines in usis and global consumer solutions which were negatively impacted by the 2017 cybersecurity incident workforce solutions saw strong growth driven by verification services international had local currency growth across all regions the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 283 million or 1 in 2018 compared to 2017   

revenue for 2017 increased by 7   compared to 2016 the growth was driven by our international and workforce solutions segments international had strong growth across all regions which reflects broad based organic growth and the veda acquisition workforce solutions saw strong growth driven by verification services usis had an increase in revenue compared to 2016 reflecting growth in core credit decisioning financial marketing services mortgage and identity and fraud solutions revenue in our usis global consumer solutions and workforce solutions segments were negatively impacted by the 2017 cybersecurity incident the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 60 million in 2017 compared to 2016   

operating expenses 



  

cost of services   cost of services increased   2297 million   in 2018 compared to 2017 we incurred increased incremental technology and data security costs of 1465 million in 2018 these increased technology and security costs predominantly reflect the investments we are making in our technology transformation which include costs for enhanced data security we expect these incremental costs as well as increased ongoing technology and security costs to continue in 2019 and 2020 the remaining increase is due to increased people and royalty costs the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 64 million   

cost of services increased 973 million   in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in cost of services when compared to 2016 was due to the increase in production costs driven by higher revenues as well as increases of 142 million in professional services related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and in people costs the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 21 million   

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased   1813 million   in 2018 as compared to 2017   

we incurred increased incremental technology and data security costs of 1607 million in 2018 as was the case in cost of services these increased technology and security costs predominately reflect the investments we are making in our technology transformation which include costs for enhanced data security we expect these incremental costs as well as increased ongoing technology and security costs to continue in 2019 and 2020   

related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we incurred net costs of 190 million in 2018 we incurred legal and investigative fees of 736 million and decreased costs to fulfill and support the free credit monitoring service provided to eligible consumers of 204 million additionally we benefited from the recognition of insurance proceeds of 750 million to offset these costs in 2018 versus the 500 million of insurance proceeds recorded in 2017   

the remaining changes were driven by increases due to the restructuring charge of 461 million people the public records litigation settlement of 185 million and insurance costs which were partially offset by decreased advertising costs   

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 102 million   

selling general and administrative expenses increased 910 million   in 2017 as compared to 2016 the increase was due to 998 million of costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident higher occupancy and people costs partially offset by a decline in veda integration and transaction costs the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 22 million   

  

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expense for 2018 increased  by 226 million  the increase is due to amortization of capitalized internaluse software and system costs and depreciation of production equipment partially offset by a decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles 

  

depreciation and amortization expense for 2017 increased by 224 million  primarily due to increased depreciation due to increased capital expenditures 

  

operating income and operating margin 



  

total company margin decreased in 2018 versus 2017 primarily due to the aforementioned technology and data security spending by the company after the 2017 cybersecurity incident of 3262 million reflected in costs of services and selling general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 

total company margin decreased in 2017 versus 2016 primarily due to the costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident partially offset by increased margins in international and workforce solutions business segments and lower integration costs related to the acquisition of veda 

interest expense and other income expense net 

  

interest expense increased in 2018 when compared to 2017 due to an increase in our overall average cost of debt resulting from the issuance of the senior notes in may 2018 

  

interest expense increased in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to an increase in our average consolidated debt outstanding in 2017 reflecting debt incurred in the first quarter of 2016 to finance the acquisition of veda our average cost of debt decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the higher balance of low rate commercial paper outstanding and lower longterm rates due to the repayment on july 3 2017 of 2725 million in principal amount of our 63 senior notes 

the increase in other income expense net in 2018 is primarily due to higher earnings on certain equity method investments an increase in interest income and the release of a liability from a past acquisition these increases were partially offset by increased pension expense and the foreign exchange impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of argentina becoming a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes in 2018 

the increase in other income expense net in 2017 is primarily due to a 2016 loss on the economic hedges offset by a foreign currency gain on intercompany debt related to the veda transaction which did not recur in 2017 there were also higher earnings on certain equity method investments in 2017 

income taxes 



  

our effective tax rate was 140  for 2018  down from 199  for the same period in 2017 the decrease in our effective income tax rate is due to the decrease in the statutory us tax rate as a result of the tax act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the increase in the benefit received from the reversal of uncertain tax positions these changes were offset by an increase in the impact of equity compensation an increase in the foreign rate differential impact and the deferred tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the impact of the tax act 

  

our effective tax rate was 199  for 2017 down from 320  for the same period in 2016 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for 2017 is primarily attributable to recording the preliminary impact of the tax act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the adoption of the new stockbased compensation guidance we prospectively adopted in the first quarter of 2017 we recognized a 483 million and 267 million tax benefit related to the estimated impact of tax legislation enacted in 2017 and the accounting change for stockbased compensation guidance for the full year 2017 respectively 

net income 

  

consolidated net income decreased  by 2917 million  or 49  in 2018 compared to 2017 due to decreased operating income primarily driven by the 3262 million  of aforementioned incremental technology and data security costs the increased costs were partially offset by decreased income tax expense due to lower pretax income and the decrease in the statutory us tax rate as a result of the tax act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 

consolidated net income increased by  1029 million  or 21  in 2017 compared to 2016 due to increased operating income principally in our international workforce solutions and usis businesses partially offset by the 2017 cybersecurity costs of 1140 million and lower operating income in the global consumer solutions business there were also several income tax benefits consisting principally of the fourth quarter tax benefit related to the tax act and the prospective adoption of the new stockbased compensation guidance in the first quarter of 2017 additionally there was an increase in other income primarily due to a 2016 loss on economic hedges offset by a foreign currency gain on intercompany debt related to the veda transaction which did not recur in 2017

general corporate expense increased   1888 million   in 2018 we incurred increased incremental technology and data security costs following the announcement of the 2017 cybersecurity incident of 1867 million in 2018 this was partially offset by a decrease in legal and investigative fees and the costs to fulfill and support the free credit monitoring service provided to eligible consumers of 752 million in 2018 further we benefited from an increase in the recognition of insurance proceeds of 750 million to offset these costs in 2018 versus the 500 million of insurance proceeds recorded in 2017 additionally we recorded 461 million of restructuring charges in 2018 which primarily relate to a reduction of headcount the remaining increase is due to people and insurance costs 

general corporate expense increased 835 million  in 2017 primarily due to 1094 million of costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

liquidity and financial condition 

  

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities remain in a strong financial position and manage our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

funds generated by operating activities our commercial paper program our revolver and our receivables facility more fully described below are our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated by operating activities will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as ongoing capital expenditures associated with nearterm actions to enhance technology systems and data security legal fees and other professional service costs associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident interest payments debt payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future however currently it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations resulting from the 2017 cybersecurity incident such potential payments if great enough could have an adverse effect on our liquidity in this case funds generated from operating activities and our credit facilities may not be sufficient to pay such damages costs penalties and fines see “item 1a risk factors— the government investigations and litigation resulting from the 2017 cybersecurity incident will continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations ”   and “item 3 legal proceedings” in the form 10k at december 31 2018  108 billion  was available to borrow under our revolver as of december 31 2018  2098 million  was available to borrow under our receivables facility in the event that additional financing is needed we would finance using the public and private corporate bond markets andor syndicated loan markets if available 

  

fund transfer limitations   the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to the us may be limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends as of december 31 2018  we held 1247  million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries 

information about our cash flows by category is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for 2018 decreased  by 1438 million   compared to 2017 due to the decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization this decrease was partially offset by an improvement in our working capital and the change in deferred income taxes 

cash provided by operating activities for 2017 decreased by 70 million  compared to 2016 due to an increase in working capital mostly driven by an increase in other assets current and longterm and slower growth in current and longterm liabilities excluding debt additionally we incurred significant costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident these decreases were partially offset by growth in net income slower growth in accounts receivable net and an increase in depreciation and amortization 

  

investing activities 



amounts above are total cash outflows for capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance licensing of standard software applications investing in system reliability security and disaster recovery enhancements and updating or expanding our office facilities 

capital expenditures in 2018  and 2017  increased from 2017  and 2016  respectively as we are continuing to invest in enhanced technology systems infrastructure and data security after the 2017 cybersecurity incident 

acquisitions divestitures and investments

financing activities 



  

credit facility availability in september 2018 the company entered into a 110 billion   five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions which will mature in september 2023  the “revolver” the revolver replaced the company’s previous 9000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in november 2020  borrowings under the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs the revolver has an accordion feature that allows us to 

request an increase in the total commitment to 160 billion  the revolver includes an option to request a maximum of two   one year extensions of the maturity date any time after the first anniversary of the revolver closing we believe we are currently in compliance with all representations and warranties necessary as a condition for borrowing under the revolver but we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all such conditions to borrowing in the future availability of the revolver is reduced by the outstanding principal balance of our commercial paper notes and by any letters of credit issued under the facility 

our 9000 million  commercial paper “cp” program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our revolver and the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver 

  

at december 31 2018  the company had no  borrowings outstanding of cp 1550 million  of letters of credit outstanding and no  borrowings outstanding under the revolver at december 31 2018  a total of 108 billion  was available under the revolver 

  

at december 31 2018  approximately 89  of our debt was fixed rate and 11  was variable rate our variablerate debt consists of the floating rate notes the interest rate resets periodically based on the terms of the respective financing arrangement at december 31 2018  the interest rate on our variablerate debt was 35 

borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm repayments borrowings primarily represent repayments or borrowings of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and as availability allows 

  

the increase in net shortterm repayments borrowings primarily relates to the net activity of cp notes in 2017  

in may 2018 we issued 3000  million aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due 2021 the “2021 notes” 4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 395  senior notes due 2023 the “2023 notes” and 3000 million  aggregate principal amount floating rate notes due 2021 the “floating rate notes” in an underwritten public offering the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolver our prior 8000 million   three year delayed draw term loan facility term loan and our cp program 

on may 12 2016 we issued 5000 million principal amount of 23 fiveyear senior notes and 2750 million principal amount of 325 tenyear senior notes in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our previous 364day revolver and a portion of the borrowings under our commercial paper program incurred to finance the acquisition of veda 

payments on longterm debt in 2017  reflect 2725 million of payments related to senior notes as well as 500 million of payments on the term loan borrowings on longterm debt reflect an 8000 million draw down in the first quarter of 2016 on our term loan facility and the issuance of 5000 million of senior notes due 2021 and 2750 million of senior notes due 2026 during the second quarter of 2016 as discussed above 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 equifax entered into a 225 million  2 year receivables funding facility the receivables facility which had an original maturity in 2019 in november 2018 we amended the receivables facility to extend the maturity to november 2020 under the receivables facility equifax sells the eligible thirdparty receivables of its us based business to equifax receivables funding llc a consolidated whollyowned bankruptcyremote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer without recourse an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors the investors have no recourse to the company’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of equifax do not have recourse to the assets of equifax receivables funding llc 

debt covenants a downgrade in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and revolver and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on mortgages liens and saleleaseback transactions in addition the revolver requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2018  the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

  

the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however the 23 senior notes due 2021 36 senior notes due 2021 floating rate notes due 2021 33 senior notes due 2022 395 senior notes due 2023 325 senior notes due 2026 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the “senior notes” contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announces the company’s intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

credit ratings   credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2018  the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb with a negative outlook for sp and baa1 with a stable outlook for moody’s a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and revolver and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment these ratings are subject to change as events and circumstances change

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1564 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards related to the assets remain with the company 

  

letters of credit and guarantees 

  

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance or surety bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2018  and generally have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2018  

  

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 12  of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was closed to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a retirement plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution components that cover most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the defined benefit component was also closed to new hires on october 1 2011 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2018  we made voluntary contributions of 300 million  to the usrip and made contributions of 04 million  to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2017  we did no t make any contributions to the usrip and made contributions of 15 million  to the crip at december 31 2018  the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets statements of income and statements of comprehensive income loss we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

  

in accordance with asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” we recognize revenue when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer and the customer obtains control of the good or service in order to recognize revenue we note that the two parties must have an agreement that creates enforceable rights the performance obligations must be distinct and the transaction price can be determined our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transactional basis in which distinct services are delivered over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services delivered to measure our performance over time the output method is utilized to measure the value to the customer based on the transfer to date of the services promised with no rights of return once consumed in these cases revenue on transactional contracts with a defined price but an undefined quantity is recognized utilizing the right to invoice expedient resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed additionally multiyear contracts with an defined price but an undefined quantity that utilize tier pricing would be defined as a series of distinct performance obligations satisfied over time utilizing the same method of measurement the output method with no rights of return once consumed this measurement method is applied on a monthly basis resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed 

additionally we recognize revenue from subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue from subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are delivered any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue from subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term multiyear subscription contracts are analyzed to determine the full contract transaction price over the term of the contract and the subsequent price is ratably recognized over the full term of the contract 

revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment from the customer if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of the performance obligation revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 

  

we sell certain offerings that contain multiple performance obligations these obligations may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services in order to account for each of these obligations separately the delivered promises within our contracts must meet the criterion to be considered distinct performance obligations to our customer if we determine that the arrangement does not contain separate distinct obligations the performance obligations are bundled together until a distinct obligation is achieved this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract obligation is delivered to our customer or ratably over the term of the contract 

some of our arrangements with multiple performance obligations involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the 

value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the installation of interfaces or platforms by our technology personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these installation services do not meet the requirement for being distinct thus any related installation fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related services revenue from the delivery of onetime files and models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of installation of a customer are capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the identifiable asset 

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction and therefore do not have control 

  

in certain instances within our debt collections and recovery management services in our international operating segment and within our workforce solutions operating segment variable consideration is constrained due to the fact that the revenue is contingent on a particular outcome within our debt collections and recovery management businesses revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the debt is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit approval from a regulatory agency or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

judgments and uncertainties –  each performance obligation within a contract must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these distinct goods or services these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its standalone selling price concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectability and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

contract balances –  the contract balances are generated when revenue recognized varies from billing in a given period a contract asset is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes more revenue than what has been billed as of december 31 2018  the contract asset balance was 73 million  a contract liability is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes less than what has been billed deferred revenue is recognized when we have an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer and have already received consideration from the customer we generally expect to recognize our deferred revenue as revenue within twelve months of being recorded based on the terms of the contracts 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have seven reporting units comprised of usis asia pacific europe latin america canada global consumer solutions “gcs” and workforce solutions effective september 30 2018 the verification services and employer services reporting units were aggregated into a single reporting unit to better reflect the shared value and integration of the two businesses prior to aggregation we assessed the recoverability of goodwill for verification services and employer services separately and determined that there was no impairment for the reporting units 

  

the goodwill balance at december 31 2018  for our seven reporting units was as follows 



we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our usis europe latin america canada gcs and workforce solutions reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units 

  

valuation techniques 

  

we performed a quantitative assessment for our asia pacific reporting unit to determine whether impairment exists as the veda transaction which comprises the majority of our asia pacific reporting unit was only completed approximately two years ago and due to the size of the cushion for the reporting unit in relation to our other reporting units in determining the fair value of the reporting unit we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value 

  

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies or guideline transactions we believe the guideline transaction used for our asia pacific reporting unit serves as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as the transaction multiples are similar to other guideline transactions that have been recently completed in our industry competition for our asia pacific reporting unit generally includes global consumer credit reporting companies such as experian which offer a product suite similar to the reporting unit’s credit reporting solutions 

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test 

growth assumptions 

  

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion  analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that 

known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of our asia pacific reporting unit was 485 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 

we projected revenue growth in 2019 for our asia pacific reporting unit in completing our 2018 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by this unit and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth the anticipated revenue growth in this reporting unit however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for the reporting unit which reflects the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth the reporting unit will also incur increased costs related to our technology transformation 

  

discount rate assumptions 

  

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows for the reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2018 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rate used to develop the estimated fair value of the asia pacific reporting unit was 93 

  

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

  

the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for our asia pacific reporting unit exceeded the related carrying value as of september 30 2018 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value our asia pacific reporting unit primarily represents our recently completed acquisition of veda due to the recency of this acquisition and its overall significance to the reporting unit asia pacific is more sensitive to changes in the assumptions noted above that could result in a fair value that is less than its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit as of september 30 2018 was 9 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote 

in the third quarter of 2017 we announced a cybersecurity incident potentially impacting us canadian and uk consumers as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we are subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in “item 3 legal proceedings” in the form 10k while we believe it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses associated with such proceedings and investigations it is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations based on the various stages of these proceedings and investigations that alleged damages have not been specified or are uncertain the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class as applicable and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues the company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable the company believes that the ultimate amount paid on 

these actions claims and investigations could be material to the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 

judgments and uncertainties — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — with the exception of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

  

income taxes 

  

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

  

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2018  249 million  was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 41 million  of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

  

pension and other postretirement plans 

  

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

during 2018 we adopted the new mp2018 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the us pension plan this updated scale along with the change in the discount rate contributed to a decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2018   

during 2017 we adopted the new mp2017 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the us pension plan this updated scale partially offset the decrease in the discount rate in 2017 the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017   

during 2016 we adopted the new mp2016 mortality improvement projection scale in determining the liability for the us pension plan this updated scale partially offset the decrease in the discount rate in 2016 the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016 

judgments and uncertainties  — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2018 our us pension plan investment loss of 32  was below the expected return of 725  the expected return for the usrip for 2019 is 670   following asset allocation changes that resulted in higher allocation to fixed income securities  the crip investment loss was 13  in 2018 versus the expected return of 60  the expected return for the crip for 2019 is 60   our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2018 is 714  which is consistent with the 2017 expected rate 

  

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5633 million  at december 31 2018  we do not expect our 2019 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2018 cost see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return  714  at december 31 2018  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2018 by approximately 28 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate  439  at december 31 2018  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2018 by approximately 11 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense pension liability or unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gains losses that could be material 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2018  a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2018  would have increased our revenue by 559 million and our pretax operating profit by 107 million for the year ended december 31 2017  a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2017  would have increased our revenue by 547 million and our pretax operating profit by 186 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2018  and 2017  

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2018  were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2018 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2019 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2019 and rates could go either higher or lower 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper revolver and floating rate senior note borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2018  our weighted average cost of debt was 38  and weightedaverage life of debt was 542 years at december 31 2018  89  of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 11  was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2018  interest expense by 30 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

2017 cybersecurity incident 

background    in fiscal 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers criminals exploited a us website application vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to our network based on our forensic investigation the unauthorized access of information occurred from midmay through july 2017 the information accessed primarily includes names social security numbers birth dates addresses and in some instances driver’s license numbers in addition credit card numbers for approximately 209000 us and canadian consumers and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182000 us consumers were accessed the investigation determined that personal information 

of approximately 19000 canadian consumers was impacted and approximately 860000 potentially affected uk consumers were contacted regarding access to personal information the forensic investigation of the cybersecurity incident was as previously disclosed completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 no evidence was found that the companys core consumer employment and income or commercial credit reporting databases were accessed   

the company acted promptly to notify the approximately 1455 million us consumers whose personally identifiable information the company had identified in 2017 as potentially accessed as a result of an ongoing analysis of data stolen in the 2017 cybersecurity incident the company recently announced that it was able to identify approximately 24 million us consumers whose name and partial driver’s license information were stolen but who were not in the affected population of approximately 1455 million consumers previously identified by the company in 2017 the company is in the process of notifying these additional consumers

workforce solutions 

  

workforce solutions operates in the us through two business units 

  

verification services  verification services include employment and income verification services our online verification services enable direct thirdparty verifiers including various governmental agencies mortgage originators credit card and automotive lenders and preemployment screeners to verify the employee’s employment status and income information we also offer an offline research verification service which expands employment verification to locate data outside our existing automated database 

  

employer services  these services are aimed at reducing the cost to the human resources function of businesses through a broad suite of services including assisting with employment tax matters designed to reduce the cost of unemployment claims through effective claims representation and management and efficient processing and to better manage the tax rate that employers are assessed for unemployment taxes comprehensive services designed to research the availability of employmentrelated tax credits eg the federal work opportunity and welfare to work tax credits and state tax credits and to process the necessary filings and assist the client in obtaining the tax credit w2 management services which include initial distribution reissue and correction of w2 forms paperless pay services that enable employees to electronically receive pay statement information as well as review and change direct deposit account or w4 information integrated electronic time capture and reporting services paperless newhire services to bring new workers on board using electronic forms i9 management services designed to help clients electronically comply with the immigration laws that require employers to complete an i9 form for each new hire and onboarding services using online forms to complete the new hire process for employees of corporate and government agencies in addition we provide software and services to employers to assist in compliance with the affordable care act aca through partnerships with government agencies 

the work number   the work number is our key repository of employment and income data serving our verifier business and enabling employer human resource services we rely on payroll data received from over 10600 organizations to regularly update the database the updates occur as employers transmit data electronically to equifax from their payroll systems employers contract to provide this data for specified periods under the terms of contracts which range from one to five years we use this data to provide automated employment and income verification services to thirdparty verifiers as well as enabling employer services such as unemployment claims i9 and everify transactions and employer tax credits opportunities 

  

the fees we charge for these services are generally on a per transaction basis we have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the database because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to the database and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to thirdparty employment verification requests the database is approaching 330 million current and historic employment records at december 31 2017  

global consumer solutions

 item 1a risk factors 

  

all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10k should be considered and read carefully the risks described below are not the only ones facing us the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below 

security breaches like the cybersecurity incident announced in september 2017 and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could compromise company consumer and customer information interfere with our operations cause us to incur significant costs for remediation and enhancement of our it systems and expose us to legal liability all of which could have a substantial negative impact on our business and reputation 

in the ordinary course of business we collect process transmit and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of consumers the secure operation of our information technology networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training and contractual precautions our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers are vulnerable to unauthorized access to data or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct attacks by hackers employee or insider malfeasance andor human error 

in 2017 we were the target of a cybersecurity attack that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers as a result of an ongoing analysis of data stolen in the 2017 cybersecurity incident the company recently announced that it was able to identify approximately 24 million us consumers whose name and partial drivers license information were stolen but who were not in the affected population of approximately 1455 million consumers previously identified by the company in 2017 the company is in the process of notifying these additional consumers it is possible that further analysis will identify additional consumers affected or additional types of data accessed which could result in additional notifications and negative publicity 

following the cybersecurity incident we began undertaking significant remediation efforts and other steps to enhance our data security infrastructure   in connection with these efforts we have incurred significant costs and expect to incur additional significant costs as we take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and the data we maintain the actions we have taken are based on our investigation of the causes of the cybersecurity incident but there will be additional changes needed to prevent a similar incident we cannot assure that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and remediated and will not occur again 

because our products and services involve the storage and transmission of personal information of consumers we will continue to routinely be the target of attempted cyber and other security threats by outside third parties including technically sophisticated and wellresourced bad actors attempting to access or steal the data we store insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern for all companies including ours in addition the 2017 cybersecurity incident may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems we must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact if we experience additional breaches of our security measures including from incidents that we fail to detect for a period of time sensitive data may be accessed stolen disclosed or lost any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to significant additional litigation regulatory fines penalties losses of customers or reputational damage any of which could have a significant negative impact on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations we expect our insurance coverage will not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur due to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and we cannot ensure that our insurance policies in the future will be adequate to cover losses from any future failures in addition our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 

the government investigations and litigation resulting from the 2017 cybersecurity incident will continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations 

as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident we are currently a party to a consolidated multidistrict consumer class action lawsuit and a consolidated multidistrict financial institution class action lawsuit as well as securities class action lawsuits shareholder derivative litigation and other lawsuits and claims allegedly arising out of the cybersecurity incident seeking monetary damages or other relief a number of us federal state local and foreign governmental officials and agencies including congressional committees the ftc the cfpb the sec the us department of justice and state attorneys general offices in the us the fca in the uk and the office of the privacy commissioner in canada continue to investigate events related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident including how it occurred the consequences thereof and our response thereto additional lawsuits investigations and reports related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident may be filed commenced or issued the claims and investigations have resulted in the incurrence of significant external and internal legal costs and expenses and reputational damage to our business and are expected to continue throughout 2018 and beyond the resolution of these matters may result in damages costs fines or penalties substantially in excess of our insurance coverage which depending on the amount could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or compliance with our credit agreements if such damages costs 

fines or penalties were great enough that we could not pay them through funds generated from operating activities andor cause a default under our revolving credit facility we may be forced to renegotiate or obtain a waiver under our revolving credit facility andor seek additional debt or equity financing such renegotiation or financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all in these circumstances if we were unable to obtain sufficient financing we may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due the outcome of such claims and investigations could also adversely affect or cause us to change how we operate our business the governmental agencies investigating the cybersecurity incident may seek to impose injunctive relief consent decrees or other civil or criminal penalties which could among other things impact our ability to collect and use consumer information materially increase our data security costs andor otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business any legislative or regulatory changes adopted in reaction to the cybersecurity incident or other companies’ data breaches could require us to make modifications to the operation of our business that could have an adverse effect andor increase or accelerate our compliance costs furthermore these matters necessitate significant attention by management which may divert the focus of management from the operation of our business resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations 

the cybersecurity incident and the adverse publicity that followed have had a negative impact on our reputation and we cannot assure it will not have a longterm effect on our relationships with our customers our revenue and our business   

  

our revenue growth in 2017 as compared to 2016 was negatively impacted by the cybersecurity incident certain of our customers have determined to defer or cancel new contracts or projects and others could consider such actions unless and until we can provide assurances regarding our ability to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and the data we maintain many of our customers are requiring security audits of our systems and any negative results of such audits may cause further losses of customers in addition some of our current and potential customers and the contracts governing certain customer relationships as well as certain of our data suppliers require us to maintain international organization for standardization “iso” certifications such as iso 27001 certification that specify requirements for establishing implementing operating monitoring reviewing maintaining and improving a documented information security management system due to the 2017 cybersecurity incident certain of our iso certifications have been suspended and we will be required to take additional remediation steps to retain such certifications which efforts may not be successful additionally certain of our payment card industry certifications have been suspended which could result in fines and loss of access to data if we are not able to complete the necessary remediation steps to retain these certifications which would adversely affect our ability to offer certain products to customers if we are unable to demonstrate the security of our systems and the data we maintain and rebuild the trust of our customers consumers and data suppliers and if further negative publicity continues we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business 

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi and telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange for a variety of reasons including concerns of data furnishers arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use additional security breaches or competitive reasons our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection disclosure or use of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could have a significant negative impact which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share and reputational loss there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

negative changes in general economic conditions including interest rates unemployment rates income home prices investment values and consumer confidence could adversely affect us 

our customers and therefore our business and revenues are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions including the demand and availability of affordable credit and capital the level and volatility of interest rates inflation employment levels consumer confidence and housing demand both inside and outside the us business customers 

use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth 

our customer base suffers when financial markets experience volatility illiquidity and disruption which has occurred in the past and which could reoccur and the potential for increased and continuing disruptions going forward presents considerable risks to our business and revenue high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue and results of operations as consumers may postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services or some of our customers may develop products of their own that replace the products they currently purchase from us which would result in lower revenue in addition many of our competitors have extensive consumer relationships including relationships with our current and potential customers moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the us mortgage market changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

some of our competitors may choose to sell products that compete with ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as a part of integrated suites given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

our relationships with key longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time many of our material customer agreements can be terminated by the customer for convenience on advance written notice which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to award more business to our competitors 

we also provide our services to business partners who may combine them with their own or other branded services to be offered as a bundle to consumers governmental agencies and businesses in support of fraud or credit protection credit monitoring identity authentication insurance or credit underwriting and collections some of these partners are the largest providers of credit information or identity protection services to the consumer market 

market competition business requirements financial condition and consolidation through mergers or acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand our relationships with our customers and business partners there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers or 

business partners on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers or business partners the loss of one or more of our major customers or business partners could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner or if the market does not adopt our new services our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process our resources have to be committed to any new products and services before knowing whether the market will adopt the new offerings in addition our management is and will continue to be intensely focused on enhancing our security measures and responding to consumer and customer concerns relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and may not be able to devote sufficient time to new product development which could cause us to be less competitive as compared to our peers lose out on new revenue opportunities and have an adverse effect on our growth and our business 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue in addition governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and global consumer solutions business units recently there also has been an increase in companies offering free or lowcost direct to consumer credit services such as credit scores reports and monitoring as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to other products and services to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

due to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and our provision of free services to consumers in connection therewith we ceased the advertisement and sale of new products in our direct to consumer business which resulted in a significant decline in revenue in that business furthermore in late january 2018 we began offering a new credit lock service lock  alert tm  that is free for life and is aimed at empowering consumers to control access to their equifax credit file directly and quickly from their smartphone or computer we expect services like our lock  alert tm  to continue to increase thereby eliminating the market for many consumer direct products and services as a result of these factors we expect that revenue from our direct to consumer business will continue to decline additionally if a significant number of consumers lock or freeze their file our population of data is reduced which could affect our product offerings and value to our customers in our other businesses 

if we experience system constraints or failures or our customers do not modify andor upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other harm to our business and reputation 

we depend on reliable stable efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network systems and data centers to provide service to our customers many of the services and systems upon which we rely have been outsourced to third parties in addition many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers these systems and operations and the personnel that support service and operate these systems could be exposed to interruption damage or destruction from power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses denialofservice attacks employee or insider malfeasance human error fire natural disasters war terrorist acts or civil unrest we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner in addition we will continue to be intensely focused on enhancing our data security infrastructure and implementation of those enhancements could result in service interruptions any significant delay or interruption could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other significant harm to our business or reputation 

we and our customers are subject to various current laws and governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations including as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection see item 1 business  governmental regulation in this form 10k for a summary of the us and foreign consumer and data protection laws and regulations to which we are subject these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business furthermore we expect there to be an increased focus on laws and regulations related to our business because of the great public concern in the us with regard to the operation of credit reporting agencies as well as the collection use accuracy correction and sharing of personal information which was heightened by the 2017 cybersecurity incident for example there are a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection due to our 2017 cybersecurity incident and other highprofile breaches that could affect us and the president of the united states could act by executive order in addition a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use access accuracy and security of such data are possible in the us state laws provide for disparate notification regimes all of which we are subject to further any perception that our practices or products are an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism private class actions reputational harm or claims by regulators which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability 

we devote substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations and requirements in the future we may be subject to significant additional expense to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to investigate defend or remedy actual or alleged violations additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state federal and foreign government investigations of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations and reputational harm in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products moreover our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation depend in part on customers adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with consumer expectations and regulatory requirements we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

for example ecuador passed a law in december 2017 that if implemented would effectively prohibit us from operating as a credit bureau within ecuador unless we are selected to operate under contract to serve the public authority that the new law tasks with providing such services these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise adversely affect our business see “item 1 business  governmental regulation” and “item 3 legal proceedings” in this form 10k 

regulatory oversight of our contractual relationships with certain of our customers may adversely affect our business 

the federal banking agencies including the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal deposit insurance corporation the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the cfpb as well as many state banking agencies 

have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with thirdparty relationships which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity by contract or otherwise and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with thirdparty service providers and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships this guidance requires more rigorous oversight of thirdparty relationships that involve certain “critical activities” in light of this guidance our existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance may continue to revise their thirdparty risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with us which may adversely affect our relationship with such customers in response to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we also have been contacted by state banking regulators seeking to examine our practices as a thirdparty service provider to the entities that they regulate it is possible that these or similar examinations by federal or state banking regulators could lead to adverse changes in our customer relationships 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

sales outside the us comprised 29 of our operating revenue in 2017 as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the argentine peso the chilean peso the euro the new zealand dollar the costa rican colon the singapore dollar the brazilian real the russian ruble and the indian rupee because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against major currencies will affect our operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies in 2017 a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the us dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in us dollars see “segment financial results  international  asia pacific” “  europe” “ latin america” and “ canada” and “effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates” in the management’s discussion and analysis section of this form 10k because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place 

accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

we also have a cost method investment in a credit information company in brazil valued in brazilian reais economic and competition risks within brazil and the company’s ability to successfully implement its strategic and operating plans have had an adverse financial impact on the value of our investment and could result in an additional impairment of the investment 

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

in addition to what we are currently experiencing due to the 2017 cybersecurity incident we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits both individual and class action against us alleging a violation of fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years 

we rely in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial operating results or it and data security profile we expect in addition if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances our growth may be adversely impacted 

historically we have relied in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business over the past several years we have acquired many smaller businesses in the us and across the world furthermore during 2016 we acquired veda the leading provider of credit information and analysis in australia and new zealand for cash consideration plus debt assumed of approximately 19 billion in january 2014 we acquired tdx a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately 323 million acquisitions may not be completed on favorable terms and the expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies it systems and personnel into our operations it and data security profiles of acquired companies may not meet the equifax standard and may take longer to integrate and remediate than planned this may result in significantly greater transaction costs for future acquisitions than we have experienced historically or it could mean that we will not pursue certain acquisitions where the costs of integration and remediation are too significant we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence and acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside of the us will increase our exposure to risks of conducting operations in international markets similarly any divestitures will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in the sale of businesses these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

despite our past experience opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances may not be available to us in the future in addition as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident and the resources and management attention required in connection therewith there may be more limited resources available for acquisitions and management’s attention is likely to be diverted away from sourcing and developing potential acquisition and joint venture opportunities resulting in decreased growth 

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels including with respect to data and system security or increase prices for their services to unreasonable levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unrealized efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competitiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws in december 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 which will significantly impact our us and global tax expense the application of many provisions in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 are uncertain at this time the impact on equifax will not be fully known until further guidance is provided by the us treasury 

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting following the 2017 cybersecurity incident our government contracts received enhanced scrutiny and negative media attention that resulted in the suspension of one of our contracts if we are unable to repair the reputational damage cause by the 2017 cybersecurity incident and ensure the security of the data we maintain our ability to maintain our existing and acquire new government contracts may be substantially impacted 

  

also the government programs to which we provide services or which are the basis of compliance services we provide nongovernmental clients including in particular the employer requirements under the affordable care act may be terminated or substantially altered by the government and our services would no longer be needed if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work if the services we provide are no longer needed due to government program change or termination or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

there has been substantial litigation in the us regarding intellectual property rights in the information technology industry from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations and we may not prevail a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all although our policy is to obtain licenses or other rights where necessary we cannot provide assurance that we have obtained all required licenses or rights 

third parties may misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as contract restrictions confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

we may need to devote significant resources including cybersecurity resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect misappropriation or infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect misappropriation or infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because a third party has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

the uk’s impending departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

the referendum on the uk’s membership in the eu referred to as “brexit” approving the exit of the uk from the eu could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations while the referendum was nonbinding the uk parliament has voted in favor of allowing the government to commence negotiations to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu and other nations the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently in addition developments regarding brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 

we are party to a 9000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in november 2020 and an 8000 million term loan facility that matures in november 2018 collectively the “senior credit facilities” the cost of borrowing under the senior credit facilities and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take that reduce our profitability or that require us to incur additional indebtedness for items such as substantial cash acquisitions significant increases in costs and capital spending in security and it systems significant costs related to settlements of litigation or regulatory requirements or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the senior credit facilities negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms or at all negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to borrow under our revolving credit facility and receivables facility 

we are party to a 2250 million  2year receivables funding facility the receivables facility as well as the senior credit facilities our revolving credit facility and receivables facility have representations covenants financial covenants and events of default which may limit our ability to borrow under such debt obligations any breach of a representation or failure to comply with any covenant or financial covenant or the occurrence of any event of default under the senior credit facilities or the receivables facility could result in a prohibition of further borrowings under the revolving credit facility and receivables 

facility or acceleration of any obligations outstanding thereunder any event of default under the senior credit facilities or receivables facility could result in a cross default under our other outstanding debt obligations 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income  

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations such as it and security which require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business further as a result of the cybersecurity incident we may suffer increased attrition we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

2017 cybersecurity incident 

in fiscal 2017 we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of us canadian and uk consumers criminals exploited a us website application vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to our network based on our forensic investigation the unauthorized access of information occurred from midmay through july 2017 the information accessed primarily includes names social security numbers birth dates addresses and in some instances driver’s license numbers in addition credit card numbers for approximately 209000 us and canadian consumers and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182000 us consumers were accessed the investigation determined that personal information of approximately 19000 canadian consumers was impacted and approximately 860000 potentially affected uk consumers were contacted regarding access to personal information the forensic investigation of the cybersecurity incident was as previously disclosed completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 no evidence was found that the companys core consumer employment and income or commercial credit reporting databases were accessed   

the company acted promptly to notify the approximately 1455 million us consumers whose personally identifiable information the company had identified in 2017 as potentially accessed as a result of an ongoing analysis of data stolen in the 2017 cybersecurity incident the company recently announced that it was able to identify approximately 24 million us consumers whose name and partial driver’s license information were stolen but who were not in the affected population of approximately 1455 million consumers previously identified by the company in 2017 the company is in the process of notifying these additional consumers

operating expenses 



  

cost of services   cost of services increased 973 million   in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in cost of services when compared to 2016 was due to the increase in production costs driven by higher revenues as well as increases in professional services related to the cybersecurity incident and in people costs the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 21 million   

cost of services increased 2260 million   in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in cost of services when compared to 2015 was due to the increase in production costs driven by higher revenues including the veda acquisition as well as increases in people costs and to a lesser extent an increase in technology costs the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 214 million   

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased  909 million   in 2017 as compared to 2016 the increase was due to costs related to the cybersecurity incident higher occupancy and people costs partially offset by a decline in veda integration and transaction costs the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 22 million   

selling general and administrative expenses increased 639 million   in 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase was due to veda selling general and administrative expense and integration and transaction costs and increases in people costs across the business the increase was offset by a decline in costs related to the realignment of internal resources the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 237 million   

  

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expense for 2017 increased by 224 million   primarily due to increased depreciation due to increased capital expenditures 

  

depreciation and amortization expense for 2016 increased by 674 million  primarily due to the veda acquisition 

  

operating income and operating margin 



  

total company margin decreased in 2017 versus 2016 primarily due to the costs related to the cybersecurity incident partially offset by increased margins in international and equifax workforce solutions business segments and lower integration costs related to the acquisition of veda 

total company margin decreased slightly in 2016 versus 2015 due to transaction and integration costs as well as increased amortization of acquired intangibles related to the acquisition of veda this was partially offset by a decline in costs related to realignment of internal resources margins in our usis workforce solutions and global consumer businesses all increased in 2016 with these increases offset by lower margins in international principally due to the veda transaction and integration costs and related amortization of intangibles 

interest expense and other income expense net 

  

interest expense increased in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to an increase in our average consolidated debt outstanding in 2017 reflecting debt incurred in the first quarter of 2016 to finance the acquisition of veda our average cost of debt decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the higher balance of low rate commercial paper outstanding and lower longterm rates due to the repayment on july 3 2017 of 2725 million in principal amount of our 63 senior notes 

  

interest expense increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to an overall increase in our consolidated debt outstanding as of december 31 2016 to fund the acquisition of veda in 2016 our average cost of debt decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the higher balance of low rate commercial paper outstanding and lower longterm rates related to the issuance of 23 and 325 senior notes 

the increase in other income expense net in 2017 is primarily due to a 2016 loss on the economic hedges offset by a foreign currency gain on intercompany debt both items related to the veda transaction which did not recur in 2017 there were also higher earnings on certain equity method investments in 2017 

the decrease in other income expense net in 2016 is due to 2016 foreign exchange losses related to the veda acquisition and the 2015 income from the settlement of escrow amounts related to an acquisition from january 2014 which did not recur in 2016 these items were partially offset by the impairment of our cost method investment in brazil in the second quarter of 2015 which did not recur in 2016 

income taxes 



  

overall our effective tax rate was 199  for 2017 down from 320  for the same period in 2016 the decrease in our effective income tax rate for 2017 is primarily attributable to recording the preliminary impact of the tax act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the adoption of the new stockbased compensation guidance we prospectively adopted in the first quarter of 2017 we recognized a 483 million and 267 million tax benefit related to the estimated impact of tax legislation enacted in 2017 and the accounting change for stockbased compensation guidance for the full year 2017 respectively 

  

overall our effective tax rate was 320  for 2016 up from 317  for the same period in 2015 the 2016 rate benefited by 2 due to international related items specifically higher earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and the rationalization of the structure of foreign subsidiaries this was offset by other nonrecurring permanent items that benefited the 2015 tax rate including the settlement of escrow related to a past acquisition and state law changes that did not recur in 2016 

net income 

  

consolidated net income increased by  1029 million  or 21  in 2017 compared to 2016 due to increased operating income principally in our international workforce solutions and usis businesses partially offset by the cybersecurity costs and lower operating income in the global consumer solutions business there were also several income tax benefits consisting principally of the fourth quarter tax benefit related to the tax act and the prospective adoption of the new stockbased compensation guidance in the first quarter of 2017 additionally there was an increase in other income primarily due to a 2016 loss on economic hedges offset by a foreign currency gain on intercompany debt both items related to the veda transaction which did not recur in 2017 

consolidated net income increased by  603 million  or 14  in 2016 compared to 2015 due to increased operating income in our usis and workforce solutions businesses this increase was partially offset by declines due to foreign exchange rates that impacted the international operating segment the increase in interest expense as well as increased corporate expenses as described below

revenue increased 16  for 2016 as compared to prior year local currency revenue grew 18 in 2016 principally due to the growth of direct to consumer reseller revenue and to a lesser extent due to consumer direct revenue growth globally local currency fluctuations against the us dollar negatively impacted revenue by 54 million or 2 for 2016 operating margin increased in 2016 to 279 as compared to 275 in the prior year due to lower marketing expenses partially offset by higher production costs due to reseller product mix and increases in partner implementation costs 

general corporate expense 



  

our general corporate expenses are unallocated costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction including shared services technology administrative legal restructuring and the portion of management incentive compensation determined by total companywide performance  general corporate expense increased 836 million   in 2017 primarily due to costs related to the cybersecurity incident 

general corporate expense increased 136 million  in 2016 due to veda transaction and integration costs as well as other increases in people costs offset by a decline in costs related to the realignment of internal resources 

liquidity and financial condition 

  

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

funds generated by operating activities and our commercial paper program credit facilities and receivables facility are our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated by operating activities will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as ongoing capital expenditures associated with nearterm actions to enhance it systems and data security interest payments debt payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future however currently it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations resulting from the 2017 cybersecurity incident such potential payments if great enough could have an adverse effect on our liquidity in this case funds generated from operating activities and our credit facilities may not be sufficient to pay such damages costs penalties and fines see part i item 1a risk factors the government investigations and litigation resulting from the 2017 cybersecurity incident will continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and part i item 3 legal proceedings at december 31 2017  2219 million  was available to borrow under our revolver as of december 31 2017  2043 million  was available to borrow under our receivables facility in the event that additional financing is needed we would finance using the public and private corporate bond markets andor syndicated loan markets 

  

information about our cash flows by category is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for 2017 decreased by 70 million   compared to 2016 due to an increase in working capital mostly driven by an increase in other assets current and longterm and slower growth in current and longterm liabilities excluding debt additionally we incurred significant costs related to the cybersecurity incident these decreases were partially offset by growth in net income slower growth in accounts receivable net and an increase in depreciation and amortization   

cash provided by operating activities for 2016 increased by 539 million  compared to 2015 due to 603 million growth in net income partially offset by an increase in working capital mostly driven by an increase in accounts receivable lower growth in other liabilities current and longterm excluding debt 

  

fund transfer limitations   the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us may be limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends we currently hold 1417  million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries 

  

investing activities 



amounts above are total cash outflows for capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance licensing of standard software applications investing in system reliability security and disaster recovery enhancements and updating or expanding our office facilities 

capital expenditures in 2017 and 2016 increased from 2016 and 2015 respectively as we are continuing to invest in new products and technology infrastructure

for additional information about our acquisitions see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

financing activities 



  

credit facility availability our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which we refer to as the revolver permits us to borrow up to 9000 million  through november 2020 the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes availability of the revolver for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes as a condition to borrow under our revolver we are required to certify certain representations and warranties as defined in the revolver we believe we are currently in compliance with all such 

representations and warranties necessary as a condition for borrowing under the revolver but we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all such conditions to borrowing in the future on october 12 2017 we borrowed 100 million  on our revolver 

  

our 9000 million  cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our revolver and the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver 

  

at december 31 2017  the company had 5626 million  of cp 155 million  of letters of credit outstanding and 1000 million  borrowings outstanding under the revolver at december 31 2017  a total of 2219 million  was available under the revolver 

  

at december 31 2017  approximately 61  of our debt was fixed rate and 39  was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consists of our issued commercial paper the revolver and term loan which bears shortterm interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2017  interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 16 to 27 

  borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and availability allows 

  

the increase in net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily relates to the net activity of cp notes in 2017  the increase in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2016 primarily relates to the net activity of cp notes as well as the draw down on the 364day revolver during the second quarter of 2016 

on may 12 2016 we issued 5000 million principal amount of 23 fiveyear senior notes and 2750 million principal amount of 325 tenyear senior notes in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning on december 1 2016 the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our 364day revolver and a portion of the borrowings under our commercial paper program incurred to finance the acquisition of veda we must comply with various nonfinancial covenants including certain limitations on mortgages liens and saleleaseback transactions as well as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets the senior notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 

payments on longterm debt in 2017  reflect 2725 million of payments related to senior notes as well as 500 million of payments on the term loan borrowings on longterm debt reflect an 8000 million draw down in the first quarter of 2016 on our term loan facility and the issuance of 5000 million of senior notes due 2021 and 2750 million of senior notes due 2026 during the second quarter of 2016 as discussed above 

the decrease in payments on longterm debt in 2015 reflects the 2014 payoff of our 150 million 734 notes and 2750 million 445 senior notes with borrowings under our cp program 

the debt issuance costs in 2016 and 2015 reflect the debt issuance costs paid in connection with the new senior credit facilities entered into in may 2016 and november 2015 respectively 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 equifax entered into a 225 million  2 year receivables funding facility the receivables facility which matures in 2019 under the receivables facility equifax sells the eligible thirdparty receivables of its us based business to equifax receivables funding llc a consolidated whollyowned bankruptcyremote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer without recourse an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors the investors have no recourse to the company’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims creditors of equifax do not have recourse to the assets of equifax receivables funding llc as a condition to borrow under the receivables facility we are required to certify certain representations and warranties we believe we are currently in compliance with all such representations and warranties necessary as a condition for borrowing under the receivables facility but we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all such conditions to borrowing in the future 

debt covenants a downgrade in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and senior credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on mortgages liens and saleleaseback transactions in addition the senior credit facilities require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio 

of not more than 35 to 10 as permitted under the terms of the senior credit facilities we made the election to increase the covenant to 40 to 10 effective for four consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter of 2016 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2016 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2017  the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

  

the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however the 23 senior notes due 2021 33 senior notes due 2022 325 senior notes due 2026 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the “senior notes” contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announces the companys intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

credit ratings   credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2017  the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb with a negative outlook for sp and baa1 with a stable outlook for moodys a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment these ratings are subject to change as events and circumstances change

equity transactions 



  

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 

  

 

 

we anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends the actual amount of such dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors and will depend upon future earnings results of operations capital requirements our financial condition and other relevant factors there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at current levels or at all 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2017  the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 



 

 

 

 

 

 



revolver and term loan future interest payments related to our senior credit facilities and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december 31 2017  through their respective maturity dates assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time the variable portion of the rate at december 31 2017  ranged from 16 to 27 for all of our variablerate debt future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates 

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1564 million  and 1170 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company 

  

letters of credit and guarantees 

  

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2017  and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2017  

  

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 15  of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1 2011 

at december 31 2017  the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2017  and 2016  we did not make any contributions to the usrip we contributed 15 million  and 08 million  to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks 

associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

  

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

  

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

  

we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract 

  

many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 

  

we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance 

  

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 

  

the debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

deferred revenue consists of amounts billed and collected in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 

  

judgments and uncertainties —  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

in addition as stated above the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 

  

effects if actual results differ from assumptions —  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 

  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

  

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have eight reporting units comprised of usis which includes online information solutions mortgage solutions and financial marketing services asia pacific europe latin america canada global consumer solutions gcs verification services and employer services 

  

the goodwill balance at december 31 2017  for our eight reporting units was as follows 



  

valuation techniques 

  

we performed a quantitative assessment for each of our reporting units to determine whether impairment exists in determining the fair value of the reporting units we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value we engaged a third party specialist to assist in developing these estimates and valuation approaches 

  

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our discussion of competition in item 1 of this form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information 

competition for our usis asia pacific europe latin america canada and gcs reporting units generally includes two global consumer credit reporting companies experian and transunion both of which offer a product suite similar to our credit reporting solutions additionally for our gcs reporting unit competition includes lifelock a national provider of personal identity theft protection products competition for our verification services and employer services reporting units includes payroll processors such as adp and paychex valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit’s operating result with the comparable companies’ information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple 

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective 

purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

  

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test 

growth assumptions 

  

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion  analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3 other than asia pacific and latin america where we used a terminal growth rate of 5 and 55 respectively based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 

we projected revenue growth in 2018 for our reporting units in completing our 2017 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth for all reporting units other than gcs for gcs we expect revenue growth to decline in 2018 as compared to 2017 and then resume revenue growth in 2019 the anticipated revenue growth in our reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth additionally we have factored in any estimable expected impacts of the cybersecurity incident as further discussed below 

  

discount rate assumptions 

  

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2017 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated were as follows for each reporting unit 



because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition or participation in less stable geographic markets than the united states such as our latin america reporting unit the discount rate selected is in the higher 

portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit additionally for our usis and gcs reporting units we utilized a higher beta to account for the additional volatility following the disclosure of the cybersecurity incident 

  

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

  

the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for our reporting units exceeded their related carrying value as of september 30 2017 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded the percentage by which the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value cushion as of september 30 2017 was as follows 



the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value our asia pacific reporting unit primarily represents our recently completed acquisition of veda due to the recency of this acquisition and its overall significance to the reporting unit asia pacific is more sensitive to changes in assumptions noted above that would result in a fair value that is less than its carrying value 

we have incorporated updated forecasts following the cybersecurity incident that we disclosed during the third quarter of 2017 as we look forward we expect our gcs reporting unit to be most impacted by the cybersecurity incident reflecting the net reduction in us subscribers as we discontinued marketing in the us in september 2017 our usis and workforce solutions reporting units were also impacted by the cybersecurity incident primarily a reduction in project revenue equifax will also incur costs related to the lock  alert tm  free lifetime service being offered in the us the impact of the cybersecurity incident continues to develop and could result in additional regulatory requirements that could further impact our us based reporting units and could impact nonus reporting units as well we continue to monitor developments and their impact on our growth assumptions and future cash flows and will evaluate any significant changes in assumptions as they occur 

additionally a significant portion of the revenue for our employer services business relates to affordable care act compliance services as such the fair value of this reporting unit would be impacted if the affordable care act were to be repealed we continue to monitor developments and their impact on our growth assumptions and future cash flows and will evaluate any significant changes in assumptions as they occur 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we announced a cybersecurity incident potentially impacting us canadian and uk consumers as a result of the cybersecurity incident we are subject to a significant number of proceedings and investigations as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings while we believe it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses associated with these proceedings and investigations it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of possible loss that might result from adverse judgments settlements penalties or other resolution of such proceedings and investigations based on the early stage of these proceedings and investigations that alleged damages have not been specified the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class as applicable and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues 

additionally as a result of the cybersecurity incident we offered free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection to all us consumers we have concluded that the costs associated with providing this service are a contingent liability that is probable and estimable we have therefore recorded an estimate of the expenses necessary to provide this service to those who signed up we have recorded 507 million through december 31 2017 included in selling general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as of december 31 2017 271 million  remains outstanding in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets refer to note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information on the cybersecurity incident 

judgments and uncertainties — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — with the exception of the cybersecurity incident we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

  

income taxes 

  

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

  

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2017  380 million  was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 183 million  of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tax act” as signed by the president of the united states on december 22 2017 significantly revises us tax law the legislation will positively impact the company’s ongoing effective tax rate due to the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 the tax act makes major changes to the us international tax system under previous law foreign earnings were subject to us tax when repatriated to the us under the tax act foreign earnings are generally exempt from us tax additionally there is a onetime deemed repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings and profits the “transition tax” the tax act imposes other us taxes on “global intangible low taxed income” and “base erosion antiabuse transactions” other significant changes include limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and repeal of the deduction for domestic production activities as a result of the current interpretation and estimated impact of the tax act the company recorded adjustments totaling a net tax benefit of 483 million  in the fourth quarter of 2017 to provisionally account for the estimated impact 

our preliminary estimate of the tax rate change resulted in a remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities of 851 million and a corresponding deferred income tax benefit in 2017 our federal income tax expense for periods beginning in 2018 will be based on the new rate   

as a result of the changes the tax act makes to the taxation of foreign earnings we recorded a valuation allowance related to the foreign tax credit carryover in the amount of 176 million  based on our initial estimates the company recorded zero   transition tax related to the tax act however the company recognized additional tax expense of 164 million  due to the inability to claim foreign tax credits in the current year   

as permitted by staff accounting bulletin no 118 provisional amounts estimated based on information available as of december 31 2017 have been made for the adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities state taxes equity compensation the calculation of the transition tax the valuation allowance related to the foreign tax credit carryover and the 2017 dividends these amounts are subject to change as we obtain information necessary to complete the calculations and clarifications to the us tax code as they occur we will recognize any changes to the provisional amounts as we refine our estimates and our interpretations of the application of the 2017 tax act   

the company has not yet made a policy election with respect to its treatment of potential global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” companies can either account for taxes on gilti as incurred or recognize deferred taxes when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of the gilti inclusion upon reversal the company is still in the process of analyzing the provisions of the act associated with gilti and the expected impact of gilti on the company in the future  refer to note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information 

  

pension and other postretirement plans 

  

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

during 2017 we adopted the new mp2017 mortality scale in determining the liability for the us pension plan this updated scale partially offset the decrease in the discount rate in 2017 the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2017   

during 2016 we adopted the new mp2016 mortality scale in determining the liability for the us pension plan this updated scale partially offset the decrease in the discount rate in 2016 the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016 

during 2015 we adopted the new mp2015 in determining the liability for the us pension plan this updated scale along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015 

judgments and uncertainties  — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount 

rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2017 our us pension plan investment gain of 179  was above the expected return of 725   for the sixth time in nine years the expected return for the usrip for 2018 is 725   the crip earned 78  in 2017 which was above its expected return of 60  for the seventh time in nine years the expected return for the crip for 2018 is 60  the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities  our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2017 is 714  which is consistent with the 2016 expected rate 

  

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5455 million  at december 31 2017  we do not expect our 2018 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2017 cost see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return  714  at december 31 2017  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2017 by approximately 27 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate  373  at december 31 2017  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2017 by approximately 16 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 

purchase accounting for acquisitions 

  

we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations  which requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect our results of operations 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2017  a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2017  would have increased our revenue by 547 million and our pretax operating profit by 186 million for the year ended december 31 2016  a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2016  would have increased our revenue by 502 million and our pretax operating profit by 165 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2017  and 2016  

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2017  were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2017 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2018 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2018 and rates could go either higher or lower 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2017  our weighted average cost of debt was 34  and weightedaverage life of debt was 495 years at december 31 2017  61  of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 39  was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2017  interest expense by 106 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

the work number is our key repository of employment and income data serving our verifier business and enabling employer human resource services we rely on payroll data received from over 7100 organizations including over three quarters of fortune 500 companies to regularly update the database the updates occur as employers transmit data electronically to equifax from their payroll systems employers contract to provide this data for specified periods under the terms of contracts which range from one to five years we use this data to provide automated employment and income verification services to thirdparty verifiers as well as enabling employer services such as unemployment claims i9 and everify transactions and employer tax credits opportunities 

  

the fees we charge for these services are generally on a per transaction basis we have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the database because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to the database and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to thirdparty employment verification requests the database is approaching 300 million current and historic employment records at december 31 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

  

all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10k should be considered and read carefully the risks described below are not the only ones facing us the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below 

  

negative changes in general economic conditions including interest rates unemployment rates income home prices investment values and consumer confidence could materially adversely affect us 

our customers and therefore our business and revenues are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions including the demand and availability of affordable credit and capital the level and volatility of interest rates inflation employment levels consumer confidence and housing demand both inside and outside the us business customers 

use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth 

our customer base suffers when financial markets experience volatility illiquidity and disruption which has occurred in the past and which could reoccur and the potential for increased and continuing disruptions going forward present considerable risks to our business and revenue high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue and results of operations as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

  

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi and telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange although historically we have not experienced material issues in this regard our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use security breaches or competitive reasons where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

  

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

  

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

  

some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other 

costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

  

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

  

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and global consumer solutions business units in addition recently there has been an increase in companies offering free or lowcost direct to consumer credit services such as credit scores reports and monitoring as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to premium products and services to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we experience system constraints or failures or our customers do not modify andor upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other harm to our business and reputation 

we depend on reliable stable efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network systems and data centers to provide service to our customers many of the services and systems upon which we rely have been outsourced to third parties in addition many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers these systems and operations and the personnel that support service and operate these systems could be exposed to interruption damage or destruction from power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses denialofservice attacks employee or insider malfeasance human error fire natural disasters war terrorist acts or civil unrest we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner any significant delay or interruption could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other significant harm to our business or reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure and uninterrupted operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy 

despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training contractual precautions and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions shutdowns or breaches of confidential 

information due to criminal conduct denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers employee or insider error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events unauthorized access to data files or our information technology systems and applications could result in inappropriate use change or disclosure of sensitive andor personal data of our customers employees consumers and suppliers 

  

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies including ours although we are not aware of any material breach of our data properties networks or systems if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 

  

we and our customers are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

we are subject to a number of us and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business foreign data protection privacy consumer protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us 

  

under title x of the doddfrank act the cfpb has broad powers to promulgate administer and enforce consumer financial regulations including those applicable to us and to many of our customers the cfpb has oversight of the fcra the federal regulation most directly impacting us operations the cfpb is also charged with defining “unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices” known as “udaap” also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties during 2016 the cfpb publicly announced 35 enforcement actions imposing 3005 million in civil money penalties and ordering 34 million in restitution and 2562 million in balance reductions 

  

in the uk we are subject to a regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the fca the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of regulated financial institutions the fca has significant powers including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products impose unlimited fines and to investigate organizations and individuals in addition the fca is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban it has the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading and to publish such decisions our core credit reporting “credit reference” and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and “approved person” authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses our license application for our debt collection services businesses tdx was approved in 2016 and our application for authorization in our capacity as a credit reference agency is under review although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable approvals are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk 

in europe we are subject to the eu data protection regulation or gdpr which will replace the comprehensive 1995 european union data protection directive the gdpr establishes several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security the new standards for adequacy are generally stricter and more comprehensive than that of the us and most other countries where equifax operates in the uk regulatory limitations affect our use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in that jurisdiction generally the data underlying the products offered by our uk information services and global consumer solutions product lines excluding our commercial services products are subject to these regulations in spain and portugal privacy laws also regulate all credit 

bureau and personal solutions activities the gdpr among other things will tighten data protection requirements and make enforcement more rigorous for example by streamlining enforcement at a european level introducing data breach notification requirements and increasing penalties for noncompliance the gdpr was passed by the eu parliament in the spring of 2016 and will become fully effective in may 2018 following a twoyear implementation period 

new legislation regarding data protection and credit reporting is under consideration in several latin american countries including legislation that proposes to adopt eu standards periodically legislative amendments are proposed to prohibit the use of certain data for credit reference purposes shorten the period during which data may be stored and create new access and notification rights for data subjects while the potential impact of the foregoing regulatory changes is unlikely to be material in the aggregate to our business if the market opportunity were to be restricted significantly in argentina or chile andor in a combination of the smaller latin american countries in which we operate the impact on our international operating results could be material we are also subject to rules and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection in the other jurisdictions in which we operate including australia and new zealand if we violate or otherwise fail to comply with these regulations our international operating results could be adversely affected see “item 1 business  government regulation” in this form 10k 

  

we devote substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations and requirements additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state and federal investigations of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business see “item 1 business – government regulation” in this form 10k 

  

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

  

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits both individual and class action against us alleging a violation of fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years 

  

we rely in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances our growth may be adversely impacted in addition the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial or operating results 

during 2016 we acquired veda the leading provider of credit information and analysis in australia and new zealand for cash consideration plus debt assumed of approximately 19 billion as well as other smaller businesses in january 2014 we acquired the tdx a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately 323 million during 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business and several smaller international businesses expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations 

we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition 

  

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

  

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

  

the impact of consolidation in our customer end markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

  

the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries to which we sell our products and services are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

  

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competitiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws 

  

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting also the government programs to which we provide services or which are the basis of compliance services we provide nongovernmental clients including in particular the affordable care act may be terminated or substantially altered by the government and our services would no longer be needed if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work if the services we provide are no longer needed due to government program change or termination or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

  

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction 

against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

  

third parties may infringe on our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

  

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

  

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

sales outside the us comprised 27  of our net operating revenue in 2016  as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the argentine peso the chilean peso the euro the new zealand dollar the costa rican peso the singapore dollar the brazilian real the russian ruble and the indian rupee because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies in 2016  a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the us dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in us dollars see “segment financial results – international – europe – asia pacific –latin america and “– canada” and “effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates” in the management’s discussion and analysis section of this form 10k because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in 

foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

  

we also have a cost method investment in a credit information company in brazil valued in brazilian reais economic and competition risks within brazil and the company’s ability to successfully implement its strategic and operating plans have had an adverse financial impact on the value of our investment and could result in an additional impairment of the investment 

  

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

the uk’s impending departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

the referendum on the uk’s membership in the eu referred to as “brexit” approving the exit of the uk from the eu could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business including affecting our relationships with our existing and future clients suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations while the referendum was nonbinding the uk parliament has voted in favor of allowing the government to commence negotiations to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu and other nations the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently in addition developments regarding brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our clients to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our solutions and services 

  

a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 

  

we are party to a 9000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in november 2020 and an 8000 million term loan facility that matures in november 2018 collectively the “credit facilities” the cost of borrowing under credit facilities and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the credit facilities negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms or at all negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income  

  

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income 

  

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

  

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

  

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

 item 2 properties 

  

our executive offices are located at 1550 peachtree street nw atlanta georgia our other properties are geographically distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide we consider these properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet our current operating requirements we ordinarily lease office space for conducting our business and are obligated under approximately 80 leases and other rental arrangements for our field locations we owned 8 office buildings at december 31 2016  including our executive offices one campus which houses our alpharetta georgia data center a building utilized by our workforce solutions operations located in st louis missouri as well as four buildings utilized by our latin america operations located in mexico city mexico sao paulo brazil and asuncion paraguay we also own 235 acres adjacent to the alpharetta georgia data center

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

california bankruptcy litigation in consolidated actions filed in the us district court for the central district of california captioned terri n white et al v equifax information services llc jose hernandez v equifax information services llc kathryn l pike v equifax information services llc and jose l acosta jr et al v trans union llc et al  plaintiffs asserted that equifax violated federal and state law the fcra the california credit reporting act and the california unfair competition law by failing to follow reasonable procedures to determine whether credit accounts are discharged in bankruptcy including the method for updating the status of an account following a bankruptcy discharge on august 20 2008 the district court approved a settlement agreement and release providing for certain changes in the procedures used by defendants to record discharges in bankruptcy on consumer credit files that settlement resolved claims for injunctive relief but not plaintiffs’ claims for damages on may 7 2009 the district court issued an order preliminarily approving an agreement to settle remaining class claims the district court subsequently deferred final approval of the settlement and required the settling parties to send a supplemental notice to those class members who filed a claim and objected to the settlement or opted out with the cost for the renotice to be deducted from the plaintiffs’ counsel fee award mailing of the supplemental notice was completed on february 15 2011 and the deadline for this group of settling plaintiffs to provide additional documentation to support their damage claims or to optout of the settlement was march 31 2011 on july 15 2011 the district court approved the settlement several objecting plaintiffs subsequently filed notices of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit which on april 22 2013 issued an order vacating the settlement and remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings on january 21 2014 the district court denied the objecting plaintiffs’ motion to disqualify counsel for the settling plaintiffs and granted the motion of counsel for the settling plaintiffs to be appointed as interim lead class counsel on march 28 2016 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the district court’s lead counsel appointment on january 9 2017 the united states supreme court denied the objectors’ petition for a writ of certiorari the parties have reengaged in settlement discussions including participation in mediations in august 2016 and november 2016 and have reached an agreement in principle to again settle the monetary claims the parties are currently drafting the necessary settlement documents the deadline to file the settlement documents with the court is march 17 2017 and the court has scheduled a hearing on the expected motion for preliminary approval on may 2 2017 

cfpb investigations in february 2014 we received a civil investigative demand a “cid” from the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” or the “bureau” as part of its investigation to determine whether nationwide consumer reporting agencies have been or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices relating to the advertising marketing sale or provision of consumer reports credit scores or credit monitoring products in violation of the dodd frank act or the fair credit reporting act the cid requested the production of documents and answers to written questions a second cid was issued in july 2015 seeking additional documents and information in january 2017 the company reached a settlement of this investigation with the cfpb the settlement requires the payment of 38 million in consumer restitution plus 25 million in civil money penalties in addition the company has agreed to modify certain marketing practices   

in june 2016 we received a cid from the cfpb as part of an investigation to determine whether equifax workforce solutions has been or is engaging in unlawful acts or practices relating to the creation provision handling advertising marketing or sale of consumer reports or similar products or services in violation of the dodd frank act or the fair credit reporting act in december 2016 the cfpb notified the company that it completed its investigation and currently does not intend to take any enforcement action against equifax workforce solutions 

other equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims regulatory matters government investigations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have strong defenses to and where appropriate will vigorously contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process

business environment and company outlook   

demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity both enhanced by our own initiatives to expand our products and markets served and to small commercial credit and marketing activity in 2017 in the united states we expect modest but improving growth in overall economic activity and consumer credit mortgage market originations are expected to be down in the double digit range for the year the economic environments impacting five of our six largest international operations in the uk australia canada argentina and chile are expected to strengthen in 2017 relative to 2016 in spain economic growth is expected to remain good in 2017 although somewhat slower than in 2016 in addition at their current levels weaker foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year will negatively impact both growth in revenue and profit when reported in us dollars   

  

over the long term we expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation business execution enterprise growth initiatives technology infrastructure and continuous process improvement will enable us to deliver longterm multiyear average organic revenue growth ranging between 6 and 8 with additional growth of 1 to 2 derived from strategic acquisitions consistent with our longterm business strategy we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue over time as a result of both operating and financial leverage

consolidated financial results 

  

operating revenue 



  

revenue for 2016 increased by 18   compared to 2015 the growth was driven by broadbased organic growth due to revenue increases in mortgage government healthcare and direct to consumer reseller verticals as well as the veda acquisition the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 752 million or 3 in 2016 compared to 2015   

revenue for 2015 increased by 9   compared to 2014 this broadbased growth was organic and was driven by revenue increases in mortgage direct to consumer reseller healthcare government and auto verticals the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 757 million or 3 in 2015 compared to 2014   

operating expenses 



  

cost of services   cost of services increased 2260 million   in 2016 compared to the prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2015 was due to the increase in production costs driven by higher revenues including the veda acquisition as well as increases in people costs and to a lesser extent an increase in technology costs the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 214 million   

cost of services increased 427 million   in 2015 compared to the prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2014 was due to the increase in production costs driven by higher revenues as well as increases in people costs and to a lesser extent an increase in professional services the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 253 million   

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased  639 million   in 2016 as compared to 2015 the increase was due to veda selling general and administrative expense and integration and transaction costs and increases in people costs across the business the increase was offset by a decline in costs related to the 

realignment of internal resources the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 237 million   

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1326 million   in 2015 as compared to 2014 the increase was principally due to increases in people costs and to a lesser extent to increases in marketing expenses professional fees as well as litigation expenses the increase was also due to the costs related to the realignment of internal resources of 207 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015 the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 246 million   

  

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expense for 2016 increased by 674 million   primarily due to the veda acquisition   

  

depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 were slightly lower compared to 2014 due to foreign currency fluctuations of 41 million 

  

operating income and operating margin 



  

total company margin decreased slightly in 2016 versus 2015 due to transaction and integration costs as well as increased amortization of acquired intangibles related to the acquisition of veda this was partially offset by a decline in costs related to realignment of internal resources margins in our usis workforce solutions and global consumer businesses all increased in 2016 with these increases offset by lower margins in international principally due to the veda transaction and integration costs and related amortization of intangibles   

  

total company margin decreased slightly in 2015 versus 2014 due to the costs for the realignment of internal resources of 207 million and other increases in people costs margins increased substantially in both the workforce solutions and usis segments and partially offset by a decline in the margins of global consumer solutions and lower margins in the international segment principally due to foreign exchange 

interest expense and other income expense net 

  

interest expense increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 due to an overall increase in our consolidated debt outstanding as of december 31 2016 to fund the acquisition of veda in 2016 our average cost of debt decreased in 2016 compared to the prior year due to the higher balance of low rate commercial paper outstanding and lower longterm rates related to the issuance of 23 and 325 senior notes   

  

interest expense decreased in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to an overall decrease in our consolidated debt outstanding as of december 31 2015 our average cost of debt increased slightly in 2015 compared to the prior year due to the higher ratio of higher interest debt and the low balance of low rate commercial paper outstanding 

the decrease in other income expense net in 2016 is due to 2016 foreign exchange losses related to the veda acquisition and the 2015 income from the settlement of escrow amounts related to an acquisition from january 2014 which did not recur in 2016 these items were partially offset by the impairment of our cost method investment in brazil in the second quarter of 2015 which did not recur in 2016   

the increase in other income expense net in 2015 is due to income from the settlement of escrow amounts related to an acquisition from january 2014 and the gain on foreign currency options put in place as an economic hedge of vedas purchase price this was partially offset by the impairment of our cost method investment in brazil in the second quarter of 2015

liquidity and financial condition 

  

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures interest payments debt payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the commercial paper or corporate bond markets or in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the revolver as described below at december 31 2016  5892 million  was available to borrow under our revolver our revolver does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement 

we were also a party to the 364day revolver which is an 8000 million revolving credit facility on may 16 2016 

we repaid all outstanding borrowings of 475 million and terminated the 364day revolver using a portion of the net proceeds

2016 acquisitions and investments during the first quarter of 2016 the company completed the acquisition of 100 of the ordinary voting shares of veda for cash consideration of approximately 17 billion during the first quarter of 2016 we settled all of the foreign currency options related to the veda acquisition on the respective settlement dates for a net cash

for additional information about our acquisitions see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

financing activities 



  

credit facility availability   our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which we refer to as the revolver permits us to borrow up to 9000 million  through november 2020 the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes availability of the revolver for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes 

  

our 9000 million  cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our revolver and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver 

  

at december 31 2016  the company had 3103 million  of cp and 05 million  of letters of credit outstanding and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver at december 31 2016  a total of 5892 million  was available under the revolver 

  

at december 31 2016  approximately 72 of our debt was fixed rate and 28 was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consists of our issued commercial paper which bears shortterm interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2016  interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 10 to 19 

  borrowing and repayment activity   net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and availability allows 

  

the increase in net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily relates to the net activity of cp notes in 2016  as well as the draw down on the 364day revolver during the first quarter of 2016 and the pay off of the veda assumed debt in the first quarter and the 364day revolver during the second quarter of 2016 the decrease in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2015 primarily relates to the net activity of cp notes in 2015 and reflects the increase in cash flow from operations as well as no material acquisitions entered into during the year 

on may 12 2016 we issued 5000 million principal amount of 23 fiveyear senior notes and 2750 million principal amount of 325 tenyear senior notes in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 of each year beginning on december 1 2016 the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our 364day revolver and a portion of the borrowings under our commercial paper program incurred to finance the acquisition of veda we must comply with various nonfinancial covenants including certain limitations on mortgages liens and saleleaseback transactions as well as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets the senior notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 

payments on longterm debt in 2016  reflect 350 million of payments on our term loan facility borrowings on longterm debt reflect an 800 million draw down in the first quarter of 2016 on our term loan facility and the issuance of 5000 million of senior notes due 2021 and 2750 million of senior notes due 2026 during the second quarter of 2016 as discussed above 

the decrease in payments on longterm debt in 2015 reflects the 2014 payoff of our 150 million 734 notes and 2750 million 445 senior notes with borrowings under our cp program 

the debt issuance costs in 2016 and 2015 reflect the debt issuance costs paid in connection with the new senior credit facilities entered into in may 2016 and november 2015 respectively 

debt covenants   the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition the senior credit facilities require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 as permitted under the terms of the senior credit facilities we made the election to increase the covenant to 40 to 10 effective for four consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter of 2016 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2016 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2016  the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

  

the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however the 63 senior notes due 2017 23 senior notes due 2021 33 senior notes due 2022 325 senior notes due 2026 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the “senior notes” contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announces the companys intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

credit ratings   credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2016  the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2015 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment

equity transactions 



  

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 

  

 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 



 

 

 

 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance 

 

 

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1170 million  and 1085 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company 

  

letters of credit and guarantees 

  

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2016  and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2016  

  

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 15  of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1 2011 

at december 31 2016  the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2016  and 2015  we did not make any contributions to the usrip we contributed 08 million  and 02 million  to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary 

retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

seasonality 

  

we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated by the online consumer information services component of our usis operating segment is typically the lowest during the first quarter when consumer lending activity is at a seasonal low revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue generated from our financial wealth asset products and data management services in our financial marketing services business is generally higher in the fourth quarter each year due to the significant portion of our annual renewals and deliveries which occur in the fourth quarter of each year 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

  

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a 

preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

  

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

  

we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract 

  

many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 

  

we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance 

  

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 

  

the debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

deferred revenue consists of amounts billed and collected in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 

  

judgments and uncertainties —  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

in addition as stated above the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 

  

effects if actual results differ from assumptions —  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have eight reporting units comprised of us information solutions which includes part of online information solutions mortgage solutions and financial marketing services asia pacific europe latin america canada global consumer solutions verification services and employer services 

  

the goodwill balance at december 31 2016  for our eight reporting units was as follows 



  

qualitative assessments 

we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for all of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for all of our reporting units 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

  

income taxes 

  

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

  

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2016  360 million  was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 71 million  of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

  

pension and other postretirement plans 

  

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

during 2016 we adopted the new mp2016 mortality scale in determining the liability for the us pension plan this updated scale partially offset the decrease in the discount rate in 2016 the net of which resulted in the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2016 

during 2015 we adopted the new generational projection scale with mp2015 in determining the liability for the us pension plan this updated scale along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015 

during 2014 we adopted the new rp2014 mortality tables and generational projection scale with mp2014 in determining the liability for the us pension plan this new table along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014 

judgments and uncertainties  — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2016 the us pension plan investment gains of 68  were below the expected return of 725  for the third time in eight years the expected return for the usrip for 2017 is at 725  the crip earned 76  in 2016 which was above its expected return of 60  for the sixth time in eight years the expected return for the crip for 2017 is at 60 the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2017 is 714  which is consistent with the 2016 expected rate 

  

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5412 million at december 31 2016  we do not expect our 2017 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2016 cost see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return  714  at december 31 2016  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately 27 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate  423  at december 31 2016  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately 08 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 

  

purchase accounting for acquisitions 

  

we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations  which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect our results of operations 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the australian dollar the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2016  a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2016  would have increased our revenue by 502 million and our pretax operating profit by 165 million for the year ended december 31 2015  a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2015  would have increased our revenue by 529 million and our pretax operating profit by 179 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2016  and 2015  

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2016  were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2016 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2017 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2017 and rates could go either higher or lower 

the veda cash consideration of approximately 17 billion 24 billion australian dollars was denominated in australian dollars and as such was subject to fluctuations related to the exchange rate of the australian dollar in december 2015 in anticipation of the veda acquisition we purchased foreign currency options to buy australian dollars with a weighted average strike price of 07225 and a notional value of 10 billion australian dollars these foreign currency options options were designed to act as economic hedges for the pending veda acquisition and are marked to market in january 2016 we purchased additional options with a weighted average strike price of 07091 and a notional value of 10 billion australian dollars we settled all of the options on the respective settlement dates in february 2016 we recognized a net loss of 154 million related to the options in the first quarter of 2016 see note 1 for further discussion 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2016  our weighted average cost of debt was 35  and weightedaverage life of debt was 572 years at december 31 2016  72 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 28 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2016  interest expense by 76 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

the work number is our key repository of employment and income data serving our verifier business and enabling employer human resource services we rely on payroll data received from over 5300 organizations including almost three quarters of fortune 500 companies to regularly update the database the updates occur as employers transmit data electronically to equifax from their payroll systems employers contract to provide this data for specified periods under the terms of contracts which range from one to five years we use this data to provide automated employment and income verification services to thirdparty verifiers as well as enabling employer services such as unemployment claims i9 and everify transactions and employer tax credits opportunities 

  

the fees we charge for these services are generally on a per transaction basis after the expiration of the applicable contract absent renewal by mutual agreement of the parties we generally do not have any further right to use the employment data we obtained pursuant to the contract we have not experienced significant turnover in the employer contributors to the database because we generally do not charge them to add their employment data to the database and the verification service we offer relieves them of the administrative burden and expense of responding to thirdparty employment verification requests the database contained approximately 277 million current and historic employment records at december 31 2015  

employer services  these services are aimed at reducing the cost to the human resources function of businesses through a broad suite of services including assisting with employment tax matters designed to reduce the cost of unemployment claims through effective claims representation and management and efficient processing and to better manage the tax rate that employers are assessed for unemployment taxes comprehensive services designed to research the availability of employmentrelated tax credits eg the federal work opportunity and welfare to work tax credits and state tax credits and to process the necessary filings and assist the client in obtaining the tax credit w2 management services which include initial distribution reissue and correction of w2 forms paperless pay services that enable employees to electronically receive pay statement information as well as review and change direct deposit account or w4 information integrated electronic time capture and reporting services paperless newhire services to bring new workers on board using electronic forms i9 management services designed to help clients electronically comply with the immigration laws that require employers to complete an i9 form for each new hire and onboarding services using online forms to complete the new hire process for employees of corporate and government agencies we also offer analytical services enabling our customers to better understand the demographic profile and key statistical metrics of their workforce in addition we provide software and services to employers to assist in compliance with the affordable care act aca through partnerships with government agencies

competition 

  

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change our competitors vary widely in size and the nature of the products and services they offer sources of competition are numerous and include the following 

 

 

 

 

while we believe that none of our competitors offers the same mix of products and services as we do certain competitors may have a larger share of particular geographic or product markets or operate in geographic areas where we do not currently have a presence 

we assess the principal competitive factors affecting our markets to include product attributes such as quality depth coverage adaptability scalability interoperability functionality and ease of use product price technical performance access to unique proprietary databases availability in application service provider or asp format quickness of response flexibility and client services and support effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts existing market penetration new product innovation and our reputation as a trusted steward of information 

technology and intellectual property 

  

we generally seek protection under federal state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by registration under applicable trademark laws or by prosecution of patent applications we own a number of patents registered in the us and several in foreign countries we also have certain registered trademarks service marks logos and internet domain names in the us and in many foreign countries the most important of which are “equifax” “decision360” “the work number” and variations thereof these marks are used in connection with many of our product lines and services we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents and trademarks are generally important to our operations and competitive position but we do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents or trademark however certain company trademarks which contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services including but not limited to the “equifax” trademark are an integral part of our business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us we also protect certain of our confidential intellectual property and technology in compliance with trade secret laws and through the use of nondisclosure agreements 

  

we license other companies to use certain data software and other technology and intellectual property rights we own or control primarily as core components of our products and services on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards and that are designed to protect our interest in our intellectual property other companies license us to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control for example we license creditscoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations 

  

governmental regulation 

  

we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business these laws and regulations may involve privacy data protection intellectual property competition consumer protection anticorruption antibribery antimoney laundering employment health taxation or other subjects in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding the collection protection dissemination and use of nonpublic personal information we have in our possession and to consumer financial protection foreign data and consumer protection privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements or the adoption of new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain these laws are enforced by federal state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate and in some instances also through private civil litigation there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection which could affect us 

  

summary of us regulation relating to consumer and data protection 

  

our us operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection protection and use of consumer credit and other information and imposing sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data many of these provisions also affect our customers’ use of consumer credit or other data we furnish 

examples of the most significant of these laws include but are not limited to the following 

federal laws and regulation 

 10

summary of international regulation relating to consumer and data protection 

  

we are subject to various data protection privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we operate examples of the most significant of these laws include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 12 

levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing data credit bureau andor consumer protection laws in paraguay and peru regulate issues such as consent collection use disclosure retention and accuracy of credit data among other protections laws in all of these countries generally allow individuals to access and request corrections of personal data 

laws in argentina chile ecuador paraguay peru and uruguay also establish specific privacy rights and judicial proceedings may be used to enforce them legislation has been proposed in several countries in latin america that would amend existing credit reporting laws by prohibiting the use of certain data for credit reference purposes shorten the period during which data may be stored and create new access and notification rights for data subjects in argentina a privacy bill of law was also filed at the congress of buenos aires province this bill proposes the creation of a provincial registry of databases stricter regulations concerning notifications to data subjects and immediate updates of their credit files the chilean government has indicated that it will introduce a new comprehensive data protection bill in 2016 and a separate bill that would create a publiclymanaged consumer credit registry remains before the legislature each of these bills would introduce a new framework to allow the government to regulate the collection and use of personal data including credit data ecuador’s national assembly approved a law to replace private sector credit bureaus with a staterun registry which when implemented would materially impact our local credit reporting operations in ecuador ecuador however represented less than one percent of our 2015 revenue and operating profit for our international business unit and is not material to our consolidated results of operations the law originally provided a transition period throughout 2013 for the development and introduction of the new registry however the transition period was then extended through 2014 in late 2014 the law was amended again to remove the fixed deadline allowing private sector credit bureaus to continue operating until the financial sector regulatory board determines that the new registry is operational to date the public body in ecuador in charge of the registry has not achieved a successful implementation in paraguay in december 2015 a modification was introduced to current data protection law requiring debts to be eliminated from a credit file once full payment has occurred in addition the amendment now permits the disclosure and use of positive data in peru there is a proposal to include certain thresholds under which delinquencies could not be reported and the obligation to send a notice prior to the registration of delinquencies legislation has been approved in el salvador to reduce the period of time during which credit information may be reported following the payment of a debt in addition to use share transfer or commercialize credit data without consent in el salvador is now a serious infraction and in the event that a credit bureau suspends or ceases operations a copy of its credit database must be provided to the regulator costa rica is in the process of amending current administrative regulations regarding data protection while the potential impact of the foregoing regulatory changes is unlikely to be material in the aggregate to the results of our international operations if the market opportunity were to be restricted significantly in argentina or chile andor in a combination of the smaller latin american countries in which we operate the impact on our international operating results could be material

 item 1a risk factors 

  

all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10k should be considered and read carefully the risks described below are not the only ones facing us the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below 

  

uncertain general economic conditions could materially adversely affect us 

  

we and our customers continue to be sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

  

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

  

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well 

as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions’ contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange although historically we have not experienced material issues in this regard our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use security breaches or competitive reasons where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

  

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

  

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

  

some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

  

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process 

if we experience system constraints or failures or our customers do not modify andor upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other harm to our business and reputation 

we depend on reliable stable efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network systems and data centers to provide service to our customers many of the services and systems upon which rely have been outsourced to third parties in addition many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers these systems and operations and the personnel that support service and operate these systems could be exposed to interruption damage or destruction from power loss telecommunication failures computer viruses denialofservice attacks human error fire natural disasters war terrorist acts or civil unrest we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner any significant delay or interruption could result in lost revenues or customers lower margins or other significant harm to our business or reputation 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure and uninterrupted operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy 

despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training contractual precautions and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions shutdowns or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events unauthorized access to data files or our information technology systems and applications could result in inappropriate use change or disclosure of sensitive andor personal data of our customers employees consumers and suppliers 

  

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies including ours although we are not aware of any material breach of our data properties networks or systems if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 

  

our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

we are subject to a number of us and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business foreign data protection privacy consumer protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us 

  

under title x of the doddfrank act the cfpb has broad powers to promulgate administer and enforce consumer financial regulations including those applicable to us and to many of our customers the cfpb has oversight of the fcra the federal regulation most directly impacting us operations the cfpb is also charged with defining “unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices” known as “udaap” also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties during 2015 the cfpb 

publicly announced 50 enforcement actions imposing 2128 million in civil money penalties and ordering 19 billion in restitution and 6363 million in balance reductions we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k 

  

in the uk we are subject to a regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the fca the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of regulated financial institutions the fca has significant powers including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products impose unlimited fines and to investigate organizations and individuals in addition the fca is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban it has the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading and to publish such decisions our core credit reporting “credit reference” and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and “approved person” authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses we submitted a license application for our debt collection services businesses tdx prior to the june 30 2015 deadline and expect to apply for authorization in our capacity as a credit reference agencies by the march 31 2016 deadline although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable approvals are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk 

  

we are devoting substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations and requirements additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state and federal investigations of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business see “item 1 business – government regulation” in this form 10k 

  

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

  

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits both individual and class action against us alleging a violation of fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years 

  

we rely in part on acquisitions joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances our growth may be adversely impacted in addition the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial or operating results 

in january 2014 we acquired the tdx a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately 323 million during 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business and several smaller international businesses in addition as described in more detail in item 7 we have entered into an agreement to acquire veda which if completed will give us a significant presence in australia and new zealand where we do not currently have significant operations expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not 

materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in countries and geographies where we do not currently have a significant presence these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition 

  

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

  

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

  

the impact of consolidation in our customer end markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

  

the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries to which we sell our products and services are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

  

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and personal solutions business units in addition recently there has been an increase in companies offering free or lowcost direct to consumer credit services such as credit scores reports and monitoring as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to premium products and services to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

  

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

  

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated 

if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

  

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

  

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

  

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

  

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

sales outside the us comprised 23  of our net operating revenue in 2015  and are expected to increase following the acquisition of veda as as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue particularly in anticipation of the veda acquisition in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the argentine peso the chilean peso and the euro and following the completion of the veda acquisition the australian dollar because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies in 2015  a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the us dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in us dollars see “segment financial results – international – latin america  europe and “ canada” and “effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates” in the management’s discussion and analysis section of this form 10k because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

  

we also have a cost method investment in a credit information company in brazil valued in brazilian reais economic and competition risks within brazil and the company’s ability to successfully implement its strategic and operating plans have had an adverse financial impact on the value of our investment and could result in an additional impairment of the investment 

  

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

  

a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 

  

we have an unsecured 364day revolving credit facility that matures november 20 2016 and an unsecured credit facility consisting of a revolver that matures on november 21 2020 and a term loan that matures on november 21 2018 the “credit facilities” the cost of borrowing under credit facilities and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the credit facilities negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms or at all negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income  

  

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income 

  

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however there is also intense competition for certain 

highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 

  

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

  

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competitiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws 

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

  

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

state attorneys general investigation the attorney general of the state of mississippi commenced an investigation in july 2013 into certain business practices of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies equifax experian and transunion we are cooperating with the attorney general of mississippi in the investigation at this time we are unable to predict the outcome of the mississippi investigation including whether it will result in any action or proceeding being brought against us 

cfpb investigation in february 2014 we received a civil investigative demand a “cid” from the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” as part of its investigation to determine whether nationwide consumer reporting agencies have been or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices relating to the advertising marketing sale or provision of consumer reports credit scores or credit monitoring products in violation of the dodd frank act or the fair credit reporting act the cid requests the production of documents and answers to written questions we are cooperating with the cfpb in its investigation at this time we are unable to predict the outcome of this cfpb investigation including whether the investigation will result in any action or proceeding against us 

other equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims regulatory matters government investigations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have strong defenses to and where appropriate will vigorously contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process

business environment and company outlook   

demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity both enhanced by our own initiatives to expand our products and markets served and to small commercial credit and marketing activity in 2016 in the united states we expect modest growth in overall economic activity and consumer credit mortgage market originations are expected to be relatively flat to slightly down for the year internationally the environment continues to be challenging as various countries address their particular political fiscal and economic issues in addition weaker foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year will negatively impact both growth in revenue and profit when reported in us dollars

twelve months ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013   

  

consolidated financial results 

  

operating revenue from continuing operations 



  

revenue for 2015 increased by 9   compared to 2014 this broadbased growth was organic and was driven by revenue increases in mortgage direct to consumer reseller healthcare government and auto verticals the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 757 million or 3 in 2015 compared to 2014   

revenue for 2014 increased by 6   compared to 2013 the growth was driven by the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 “tdx acquisition” and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses the growth was offset by the expected decline in mortgage market activity the fourth quarter of 2014 benefited from the relative improvement in mortgage activity in the us which declined in the second half of 2013 through 2014 but at a lesser rate in fourth quarter of 2014 this expected decline reduced reported growth rates in our usis and workforce solutions business units for 2014 as compared to the same period for 2013 the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 349 million or 1 in the 2014 compared to 2013   

operating expenses 



  

cost of services   cost of services increased 427 million   in 2015 compared to the prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2014 was due to the increase in production costs driven by higher revenues as well as increases in people costs and to a lesser extent an increase in professional services the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 253 million   

cost of services increased 574 million   in 2014 compared to the prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2013 was due primarily to the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 and the 2013 acquisitions the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 77 million   

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased  1326 million   in 2015 as compared to 2014 the increase was principally due to increases in people costs and to a lesser extent to increases in marketing expenses professional fees as well as litigation expenses the increase was also due to the costs related to the realignment of internal resources of 207 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015 the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 246 million   

selling general and administrative expenses increased 359 million   in 2014 as compared to 2013 the increase was due to the impact of the tdx acquisition in the first quarter of 2014 and the 2013 acquisitions an increase in litigation and regulatory compliance expenses including a third quarter 2014 settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements and an increase in incentives these increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing and professional services expenses as well as smaller decreases in expense in various other categories the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 68 million   

  

depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 were slightly lower compared to 2014 due to foreign currency fluctuations of 41 million   

  

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was driven by 185 million of incremental expense resulting from the tdx acquisition primarily related to amortization of purchased intangibles the tdx acquisition amortization is partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets related to the talx acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013 

  

operating income and operating margin 



  

total company margin decreased slightly in 2015 due to the costs for the realignment of internal resources of 207 million and other increases in people costs the decrease was mostly offset by the margin improvements of 290 basis points and 510 basis points in our usis and workforce solutions segments respectively   

  

total company margin decreased slightly in 2014 due to a third quarter 2014 settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements and increased cost of services and acquisitionrelated amortization expense related to the acquisition of tdx the decrease was partially offset by a reduction in amortization of certain purchased intangible assets related to our talx corporation acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013 

interest expense and other income expense net 

  

interest expense decreased in 2015 when compared to 2014 due to an overall decrease in our consolidated debt outstanding as of december 31 2015 our average cost of debt increased slightly in 2015 compared to the prior year due to the higher ratio of higher interest debt and the low balance of low rate commercial paper outstanding   

  

interest expense decreased slightly in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to the payoff of our 734 notes and 445 senior notes during 2014 our consolidated debt balance increased as compared to the prior year as a result of commercial paper issued to fund the majority of the acquisition price of tdx the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2014 is due to the payoff of our 734 notes and 445 senior notes and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year 

the increase in other income expense net in 2015 is due to the settlement of escrow amounts related to an acquisition from january 2014 and the gain on foreign currency options put in place as an economic hedge of vedas purchase price partially offset by impairment of our cost method investment in brazil in the second quarter of 2015   

the increase in other income expense net in 2014 is due to the impairment of our cost method investment in brazil recorded in 2013 which did not recur in 2014 other income expense net in 2014 also includes 70 million in foreign exchange losses related to dividends declared by our subsidiary in argentina and losses incurred in repatriating these funds these losses were partially offset by an increase in our equity in the earnings of our russian joint venture 

income taxes 



  

overall our effective tax rate was 317  for 2015 down from 349  for the same period in 2014 the 2015 rate benefited by 2 due to international related items specifically the increased recognition of foreign tax credits and the permanent item associated with the settlement of escrows related to past acquisitions and 14 due to the state law changes 

  

overall our effective tax rate was 349  for 2014 down from 356  for the same period in 2013 the 2014 rate benefited by 11 as compared to the 2013 rate due to the favorable impact of 2014 international permanent and discrete items the 2014 effective rate increased by 04 as compared to 2013 due to increases in state income tax rates which became effective or enacted in 2014 

net income 

  

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased by  608 million  or 16  in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased operating income in our usis and workforce solutions businesses this increase was partially offset by declines due to foreign exchange rates that impacted the international operating segment declines in the personal solutions operating segment as well as increased corporate expenses due significantly to the realignment of our internal resources and increases in people costs 

  

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased by  325 million  or 10  in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased operating income in our usis workforce solutions and personal solutions operating segments and a lower effective income tax rate partially offset by declines in the international operating segment the increase in net income attributable to equifax for 2014 as compared to the prior year was partially offset by the absence of earnings from the discontinued operations including a gain on the disposition of those operations which benefited the prior year period

revenue increased 5  in 2014 compared to prior year due to strong growth in nonmortgage verticals which was partially offset by the expected decline in mortgagerelated verification revenue in 2014 driven by the anticipated decline in mortgage market activity in 2014 the revenue growth in nonmortgage verticals was primarily a result of increased revenue mostly related to government preemployment and auto segments 

  

employer services   revenue grew 8   in 2015 as compared to 2014 revenue growth was due to continued higher employment based tax credit activity due to the delayed approval of the federal work opportunity tax credit program for 2014 as well as growth in our employerbased compliance solutions and workforce analytics business

liquidity and financial condition 

  

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures interest payments debt payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the senior credit facility as described below on november 21 2015 the company refinanced the existing unsecured revolving credit facility of 7500 million set to expire on december 19 2017 and entered into a new credit agreement the “senior credit facility” the senior credit facility includes a revolving credit facility of 9000 million revolver and a delayed draw term loan of 8000 million term loan facility with maturity dates of november 21 2020 and november 21 2018 respectively with an option to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility by an additional two years the senior credit facility allows the company to request incremental loans of up to 3000 million borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and share repurchase programs availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper notes additionally the company entered into an 8000 million 364day revolving credit facility on november 21 2015 the “364day revolver” and together with the revolver and the term loan facility the “senior credit facilities” the 364day revolver has a maturity date of november 19 2016 the commitments under the term loan facility and the 364day revolver will be funded following the shareholder and court approval refer to note 16 for further discussion the term loan facility and the 364day revolver provide that the company may upon notice to the administrative agent terminate or permanently reduce any class of commitments commitments with respect to the 364day revolver will also be reduced on a dollarfordollar basis to the extent the company issues other senior indebtedness the company plans to replace some of the senior credit facilities with senior notes in the future 

at december 31 2015  8523 million  was available to borrow under our senior credit facility our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement 

  

information about our cash flows by category is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for 2015 increased by 1259 million   over the prior year due to 756 million growth in net income adjusted for the brazil impairment and improvements in working capital notably an increase in current liabilities related to current payables incentives and unearned income   

cash provided by operating activities for 2014 increased by 472 million  over the prior year cash provided from net income excluding the impact of the 2013 divestitures the impairment of our cost method investment in 2013 the impact of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense increased 359 million the remaining increase in cash from operations was driven by changes in net working capital in 2014 as compared to 2013 

  

fund transfer limitations   the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments such as argentina these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends we currently hold 868 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries 

  

investing activities 



  

our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance licensing of standard software applications investing in system reliability security and disaster recovery enhancements and updating or expanding our office facilities 

capital expenditures in 2015 increased from 2014 as we are continuing to invest in new products and technology infrastructure capital expenditures in 2014 were comparable to 2013 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 



  

2015 acquisitions and investments during the first quarter of 2015 we acquired a 75 equity interest investment in a debt collections and recovery management venture in the uk as more fully described in note 1 during the third quarter of 2015 we received 29 million proceeds from the escrow related to a past disposition we did not make significant investments in unconsolidated affiliates during 2015 

2014 acquisitions and investments during the first quarter of 2014 we acquired tdx included as part of our international operating segment and forseva included as part of our usis operating segment during the first quarter of 2013 we divested two nonstrategic business lines equifax settlement services which was part of our mortgage business within the usis operating segment and talent management services which was part of our employer services business within our workforce solutions operating segment for a total of 475 million 35 million of the proceeds of the sale of talent management services was placed into an escrow account to be released to us at a later date during 2014 we received 06 million of the proceeds from the escrow 

  

we invested 25 million in our joint venture in india during 2014 this investment was more than offset by dividends received from our joint venture in russia 

2013 acquisitions and investments   during the third quarter of 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business that is included as part of our personal solutions business unit during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed two acquisitions in paraguay and mexico in the latin america region of our international segment 

  

in the first quarter of 2013 we divested of two nonstrategic business lines as discussed above for a total of 475 million 35 million of the proceeds of the sale of talent management services was placed into an escrow account and was released to us in 2015 and 2014 we also divested of three other small nonstrategic operations 

  

we invested 80 million in our joint ventures in 2013 to increase our percentage ownership interest in russia and as a general capital call in india as well as 11 million in another international entity 

  

for additional information about our acquisitions see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

financing activities 



  

credit facility availability   our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which we refer to as the revolver permits us to borrow up to 9000 million  through november 2020 the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes availability of the revolver for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes 

  

our 9000 million  cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our revolver and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver 

  

at december 31 2015  the company had 472 million  of cp and 05 million  of letters of credit outstanding and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver at december 31 2015  a total of 8523 million  was available under the revolver 

  

at december 31 2015  approximately 96 of our debt was fixed rate and 4 was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consists of our issued commercial paper which bears shortterm interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2015  interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 065 to 075 

 the obligations of the lenders to fund the term loan facility and the 364day revolver are subject to certain conditions including the approval by veda shareholders of the acquisition and the nonoccurence of a material adverse change related to veda refer to note 16 for further discussion 

  

borrowing and repayment activity   net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and availability allows 

  

the decrease in net shortterm repayments borrowings primarily relates the net activity of cp notes in 2015 and reflects the increase in cash flow from operations as well as no material acquisitions entered into during the year the increase in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2014 primarily reflects the borrowing of cp notes in the first quarter of 2014 to fund the acquisition of tdx as well as the 2014 payoff of our 150 million 734 notes and 2750 million 445 senior notes outstanding at december 31 2013 with borrowings under our cp program 

the increase in payments on longterm debt in 2014 reflects the payoff of our 150 million 734 notes and 2750 million 445 senior notes outstanding at december 31 2013 with borrowings under our cp program 

the increase in debt issuance costs in 2015 reflects the debt issuance costs paid in connection with the new senior credit facilities entered into in november 2015 

debt covenants   the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition the senior credit facilities requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limits the amount of subsidiary debt the companys leverage ratio was 126 at december 31 2015  none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2015  the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

  

the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt however the 63 senior notes due 2017 33 senior notes due 2022 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the “senior notes” contain change in control provisions if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announce the companys intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

credit ratings   credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2015  the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2014 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

on november 21 2015 we entered into the agreement to acquire veda for a cash consideration of approximately 17 billion 24 billion australian dollars and debt assumed of approximately 1884 million 2615 million australian dollars we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions as disclosed above 

  

refer to item 1a risk factors and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the proposed acquisition of veda 

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 1085 million  and 923 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company 

  

letters of credit and guarantees 

  

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2015  and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2015  

  

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 20  of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1 2011 

at december 31 2015  the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2015  and 2014  we did not make any contributions to the usrip we contributed 02 million  and 12 million  to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

seasonality 

  

we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our online information solutions and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our financial marketing services business line within usis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

  

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

  

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our 

clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

  

we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract 

  

many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 

  

we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance 

  

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 

  

the debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

deferred revenue consists of amounts billed and collected in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 

  

judgments and uncertainties —  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

in addition as stated above the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 

  

effects if actual results differ from assumptions —  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 

  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

  

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have seven reporting units comprised of us information solutions which includes part of online information solutions mortgage solutions and financial marketing services europe latin america canada personal solutions verification services and employer services based on the companys enterprisewide strategy weve consolidated the identity management reporting unit with the us information solutions reporting unit in 2015 we performed goodwill impairment tests prior to and following the consolidation for usis and identity management reporting units which resulted in no impairment 

  

the goodwill balance at december 31 2015  for our seven reporting units was as follows 



  

qualitative assessments 

we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for all of our reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for all of our reporting units 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

  

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2015  246 million  was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 94 million  of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

  

pension and other postretirement plans 

  

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

during 2015 we adopted the new generational projection scale with mp2015 in determining the liability for the us pensions plan this updated scale along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2015 

during 2014 the we adopted the new rp2014 mortality tables and generational projection scale with mp2014 in determining the liability for the us pensions plan this new table along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014 

judgments and uncertainties  — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is not significant and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2015 the us pension plan investment losses of 11  were below the expected return of 75  for the second time in seven years the expected return for the usrip for 2016 is at 725  which is a reduction from the rate used for 2015 the crip earned 29  in 2015 which was below its expected return of 675  for the second time in seven years the expected return for the crip for 2016 is at 60 which is a reduction from 

the rate used for 2015 the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2016 is 712  which is slightly lower than the 2015 expected rate 

  

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5433 million at december 31 2015  we do not expect our 2016 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2015 cost see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return  712  at december 31 2015  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately 27 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate  486  at december 31 2015  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately 04 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 

  

purchase accounting for acquisitions 

  

we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations  which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2015  a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2015 would have increased our revenue by 529 million and our pretax operating profit by 179 million for the year ended december 31 2014 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2014 would have increased our revenue by 540 million and our pretax operating profit by 181 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2015 and 2014 

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2015  were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2015 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2016 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2016 and rates could go either higher or lower 

the veda cash consideration of approximately 17 billion 24 billion australian dollars is denominated in australian dollars and as such subject to fluctuations related to the exchange rate of the australian dollar a 001 increase or decrease in the exchange rate of the australian dollar results in a 242 million increase or decrease in the acquisition price in december 2015 in anticipation of the veda acquisition we purchased foreign currency options to buy australian dollars with a weighted average strike price of 07225 and a notional value of 10 billion australian dollars these foreign currency options options were designed to act as economic hedges for the pending veda acquisition and are marked to market in january 2016 we purchased additional options with a weighted average strike price of 07091 and a notional value of 10 billion australian dollars we closed out all of the options on the respective settlement dates in february 2016 we recognized a net loss of 154 million related to the options in the first quarter of 2016 see note 1 for further discussion 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2015  our weighted average cost of debt was 45  and weightedaverage life of debt was 907 years at december 31 2015  96 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 4 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2015 interest expense by 05 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have limited exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business these laws and regulations may involve privacy data protection intellectual property competition consumer protection anticorruption antibribery antimoney laundering employment health taxation or other subjects in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding the collection protection dissemination and use of nonpublic personal information we have in our possession and to consumer financial protection foreign data and consumer protection privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements or the adoption of new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain these laws are enforced by federal state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate and in some instances also through private civil litigation there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection which could affect us 

  

summary of us regulation relating to consumer and data protection 

  

our us operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection protection and use of consumer credit and other information and imposing sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data many of these provisions also affect our customers’ use of consumer credit or other data we furnish 

examples of the most significant of these laws include but are not limited to the following 

federal laws and regulation 

  

 

the cfpb may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce these laws and rules in these proceedings the cfpb can obtain cease and desist orders which can include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts as well as other kinds of affirmative relief and monetary penalties ranging from 5000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to 25000 per day for reckless violations and 1 million per day for knowing violations also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties 

  

under udaap the cfpb has exercised its broad powers to examine the acts and practices of entities subject to its jurisdiction and declare those acts or practices to be unfair deceptive or abusive 

  

if the cfpb or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have material adverse effect on us we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k at this time we cannot predict the extent to which the doddfrank act the resulting rules and regulations including those of the cfpb or exercise of its or other enforcement powers will impact our operational results financial condition or liquidity 

  

the cfpb examinations may include the filing of reports reviewing materials we use to offer products and services and our compliance management systems and procedures our cfpb examinations to date have covered our regulatory compliance management system the us portion of our north america personal solutions business unit directtoconsumer our consumer dispute handling process and our data accuracy we are continuing to constructively engage with the cfpb on the results of all examinations

 item 1a risk factors 

  

all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10k should be considered and read carefully the risks described below are not the only ones facing us the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below 

  

uncertain general economic conditions could materially adversely affect us 

  

although there has been some improvement in overall global macroeconomic conditions in 2014 we and our customers continue to be sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

  

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

  

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions’ contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange although historically we have not experienced material issues in this regard our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use security breaches or competitive reasons where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

  

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

  

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

  

some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

  

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure and uninterrupted operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy 

despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training contractual precautions and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions shutdowns or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events 

  

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact although we have not experienced any material breach of cybersecurity if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation significant losses regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our thirdparty insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 

  

our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

we are subject to a number of us and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection the fair credit reporting act fcra regulates the disclosure of consumer credit reports by consumer reporting agencies and the use of consumer report information by banks and other companies these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business foreign data protection privacy consumer protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us for example new data protection regulations currently being considered by the european union “eu” legislative bodies propose more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to noneu countries reliance on express consent from data subjects as opposed to assumed or implied consent a right to require data processors to delete personal data and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms 

  

under title x of the doddfrank act the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” has broad powers to promulgate administer and enforce consumer financial regulations including those applicable to us and to many of our customers the cfpb has oversight of the fair credit reporting act as amended “fcra” the federal regulation most directly impacting us operations the cfpb is also charged with defining “unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices” known as “udaap” also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties during 2014 the cfpb announced more than 23 enforcement actions and imposed more than 1126 million in civil penalties and nearly 18 billion in restitution we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k 

  

in the uk we are subject to a regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the financial conduct authority the “fca” the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of all other regulated financial institutions the fca has significant powers including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products impose unlimited fines and to investigate organizations and individuals in addition the fca is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban it has the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading and to publish such decisions our core credit reporting “credit reference” and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and “approved person” authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses the fca has fixed the dates by which credit reference agencies and collection businesses must apply for this authorization credit reference agencies must apply by march 31 2016 and debt collections services businesses must apply by june 30 2015 we are preparing to submit a license application for our collection business tdx by june 30 2015 although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable approvals are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk 

  

we are devoting substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable regulations and requirements additionally we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state and federal investigations of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business see “item 1 business – government regulation” in this form 10k 

  

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

  

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a cra for violation of the fcra and the number of consumer lawsuits against us alleging a violation of fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years 

  

the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results 

  

in january 2014 we acquired the tdx group tdx a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately 323 million during 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business and several smaller international businesses we also completed the integration of the credit services business and assets we acquired from csc credit services inc on december 28 2012 for 10 billion expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition 

  

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

  

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these thirdparty providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

  

the impact of consolidation in our customer end markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

  

the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries to which we sell our products and services are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

  

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our usis and personal solutions business units to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these public sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

  

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

  

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

  

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on thirdparty intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

  

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

  

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

  

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

sales outside the us comprised 26  of our net operating revenue in 2014  and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the argentine peso the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies in 2014  a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the us dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in us dollars see “segment financial results – international – latin america and “ canada consumer” and “effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates” in the management’s discussion and analysis section of this form 10k because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

  

we also have a cost method investment in a credit information company in brazil valued in brazilian reais economic and competition risks within brazil and the company’s ability to successfully implement its strategic and operating plans have had an adverse financial impact on the value of our investment and could result in an additional impairment of the investment 

  

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

  

a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 

  

the cost of borrowing under our unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on december 19 2017 the “credit agreement” and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the credit agreement negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms or at all negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income  

  

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income 

  

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 

  

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

  

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws 

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

  

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

consolidated financial results 

  

operating revenue from continuing operations 



  

revenue for 2014 increased by 6  compared to 2013 the growth was driven by the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 “tdx acquisition” and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses the growth was offset by the expected decline in mortgage market activity the fourth quarter of 2014 benefited from the relative improvement in mortgage activity in the us which declined in the second half of 2013 through 2014 but at a lesser rate in fourth quarter of 2014 this expected decline reduced reported growth rates in our usis and workforce solutions business units for 2014 as compared to the same period for 2013 the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 349 million or 1 in the 2014 compared to 2013 

revenue for 2013 increased by 11  compared to 2012 the growth was driven by the acquisition of csc credit services in the fourth quarter of 2012 “csc credit services acquisition” and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses the growth was offset by the expected net decline in mortgage market activity the first half of 2013 benefited from the impact of increased mortgage refinancing activity in the us which as expected began to decline in the second half of 2013 as compared to the prior year this expected decline reduced reported growth rates in our usis and workforce solutions business units for the second half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2013 the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 204 million in the 2013 compared to 2012 

  

operating expenses 



  

cost of services   cost of services increased 574 million  in 2014 compared to the prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2013 was due primarily to the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 and the 2013 acquisitions the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 77 million 

cost of services increased 278 million  in 2013 compared to the prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2012 was due primarily to increased salary and benefit costs of 278 million as well as smaller increases across other categories the csc credit services acquisition did not have a material impact on cost of services as this business had already been processed on our systems under our previous affiliate arrangement the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 49 million 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased  359 million  in 2014 as compared to 2013 the increase was due to the impact of the tdx acquisition in the first quarter of 2014 and the 2013 acquisitions an increase in litigation and regulatory compliance expenses including a third quarter 2014 settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements and an increase in incentives these increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing and professional services expenses as well as smaller decreases in expense in various other categories the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 68 million 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 423 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase was due to increased salary severance advertising litigation and regulatory compliance expenses of 564 million as well as smaller increases in expense in various categories as we continue to support our business growth 2013 expenses were also impacted by the csc credit services acquisition which contributed approximately 19 million of incremental selling general and administrative expenses some of which are transitional expenses as we integrate the business these expenses were partially offset by the 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 and declines in incentive costs the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 44 million 

  

depreciation and amortization   the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was driven by 185 million of incremental expense resulting from the tdx acquisition primarily related to amortization of purchased intangibles the tdx acquisition amortization is partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets related to the talx acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013 

  

the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was driven by 491 million of incremental expense resulting from the csc credit services acquisition primarily related to amortization of purchased intangibles the csc credit services acquisition amortization is partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets related to the talx acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013 as well as other miscellaneous purchased intangible assets that fully depreciated during 2013 

  

operating income and operating margin 



  

total company margin decreased slightly in 2014 due to a third quarter 2014 settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements and increased cost of services and acquisitionrelated amortization expense related to the acquisition of tdx the decrease was partially offset by a reduction in amortization of certain purchased intangible assets related to our talx corporation acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013 

  

in 2013 operating income increased faster than revenue due to margin improvements in our workforce solutions and north america personal solutions businesses reflecting rapid revenue growth and the ability to leverage our existing cost base operating income in 2012 was also negatively impacted by the 387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 

interest expense and other income expense net 

  

interest expense decreased slightly in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to the payoff of our 734 notes and 445 senior notes during 2014 our consolidated debt balance increased as compared to the prior year as a result of commercial paper issued to fund the majority of the acquisition price of tdx the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2014 is due to the payoff of our 734 notes and 445 senior notes and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year 

  

interest expense increased in 2013 when compared to 2012 due to the issuance of 500 million of 330 tenyear senior notes in december 2012 to fund the csc credit services acquisition our consolidated debt balance decreased as compared to the prior year as a result of paying down 2650 million of commercial paper during 2013 that was used to partially fund the csc credit services acquisition the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2013 is due to the issuance of the 500 million senior notes at a low interest rate and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year 

the increase in other income expense net in 2014 is due to the impairment of our cost method investment representing a 15 equity interest in boa vista servicos sa “bvs” recorded in 2013 which did not recur in 2014 other income expense net in 2014 also includes 70 million in foreign exchange losses related to dividends declared by our subsidiary in argentina and losses incurred in repatriating these funds these losses were partially offset by an increase in our equity in the earnings of our russian joint venture 

the decrease in other income expense net in 2013 is due to the impairment of our cost method investment representing a 15 equity interest in bvs recorded in 2013 during the fourth quarter of 2013 the management of bvs revised its nearterm outlook and its operating plans to reflect reduced nearterm market expectations for credit information services in brazil and increased investment needed to achieve its strategic objectives as a result of these changes and the associated nearterm changes in cash flow expected from the business we recorded a 40 million brazilian reais 170 million impairment of our original investment of 130 million brazilian reais if the economic growth in brazil remains at lower than trend levels for an extended period or if bvs is unsuccessful in effectively implementing its strategy further writedowns could be recognized in future periods other income expense net in 2013 also includes 65 million in foreign exchange losses related to dividends declared by our subsidiary in argentina and losses incurred in repatriating these funds these losses were partially offset by an increase in our equity in the earnings of our russian joint venture 

income taxes 



  

overall our effective tax rate was 349  for 2014 down from 356  for the same period in 2013 the 2014 rate benefited by 11 as compared to the 2013 rate due to the favorable impact of 2014 international permanent and discrete items the 2014 effective rate increased by 04 as compared to 2013 due to increases in state income tax rates which became effective or enacted in 2014 we expect our effective tax rate in 2015 to be in the range of 35 to 36 

  

our effective tax rate was 356 for 2013 down from 362 for the same period in 2012 the 2013 rate benefited by 37 as compared to the 2012 rate due to the unfavorable impact in 2012 of certain onetime effects caused by certain international tax planning implemented during 2012 this was offset by a onetime 28 benefit in 2012 associated with a tax method change approved by tax authorities in 2012 the 2013 effective rate increased by 06 as compared to 2012 due to increases in state income tax rates which became effective in 2013 

net income 

  

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased by  325 million  or 10  in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased operating income in our usis workforce solutions and north america personal solutions operating segments and a lower effective income tax rate partially offset by declines in the international operating segment the increase in net income attributable to equifax for 2014 as compared to the prior year was partially offset by the absence of earnings from the discontinued operations including a gain on the disposition of those operations which benefited the prior year period 

  

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased by  662 million  or 24  in 2013 compared to 2012 due to increased operating income in all four of our operating segments net of associated income taxes and higher interest expense as a result of our csc credit services acquisition net income attributable to equifax for 2013 as compared to the prior year also benefited from increased income from discontinued operations driven by an 184 million gain after tax on the sale of our talent management services and equifax settlement services business lines this gain was primarily the result of an income tax benefit of 181 million including 143 million of current tax benefits this increase was partially offset by the absence of earnings from the discontinued operations which benefited the prior year period

our general corporate expenses are unallocated costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction including shared services administrative legal restructuring and the portion of management incentive compensation determined by total companywide performance general corporate expense was comparable to 2013 

general corporate expenses decreased by 285 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the 387 million pension settlement recorded in 2012 partially offset by higher salary benefit and restructuring costs as well as spending to support corporate growth and infrastructure initiatives 

liquidity and financial condition 

  

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures interest payments debt payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the senior credit facility as described below at december 31 2014  3688 million  was available to borrow under our senior credit facility our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement 

  

information about our cash flows by category is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for 2014 increased by 472 million  over the prior year cash provided from net income excluding the impact of the 2013 divestitures the impairment of our cost method investment in 2013 the impact of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense increased 359 million  the remaining increase in cash from operations was driven by changes in net working capital in 2014 as compared to 2013 

cash provided by operating activities for 2013 increased by 727 million  compared to 2012 cash provided from net income excluding the impact of the 2013 divestitures the impairment of our cost method investment in 2013 the impact of the 2012 pension settlement and adjusting for an increase in amortization expense resulting from the csc credit services acquisition increased 653 million this increase in cash from operations was driven by the increase in net income in 2013 as compared to 2012 

  

fund transfer limitations   the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments such as argentina these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends we currently hold 1234 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries 

  

investing activities 



  

our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance licensing of standard software applications investing in system reliability security and disaster recovery enhancements and updating or expanding our office facilities 

capital expenditures in 2014 were not materially different from 2013 as we are continuing to invest in new products and technology infrastructure capital expenditures in 2013 increased from 2012 as we continued to invest in new products and technology infrastructure 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 



  

2014 acquisitions and investments during the first quarter of 2014 we acquired tdx included as part of our international operating segment and forseva included as part of our usis operating segment during the first quarter of 2013 we divested two nonstrategic business lines equifax settlement services which was part of our mortgage business within the usis operating segment and talent management services which was part of our employer services business within our workforce solutions operating segment for a total of 475 million 35 million of the proceeds of the sale of talent management services was placed into an escrow account to be released to us at a later date during 2014 we received 06 million of the proceeds from the escrow 

  

we invested 25 million in our joint venture in india during 2014 this investment was more than offset by dividends received from our joint venture in russia 

2013 acquisitions and investments   during the third quarter of 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business that is included as part of our north america personal solutions business unit during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed two acquisitions in paraguay and mexico in the latin america region of our international segment 

  

in the first quarter of 2013 we divested of two nonstrategic business lines as discussed above for a total of 475 million 35 million of the proceeds of the sale of talent management services was placed into an escrow account and will be released to us 18 months after the transaction date we also divested of three other small nonstrategic operations 

  

we invested 80 million in our joint ventures in 2013 to increase our percentage ownership interest in russia and as a general capital call in india as well as 11 million in another international entity 

  

for additional information about our acquisitions see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

2012 acquisitions and investments on december 28 2012 as a part of our longterm growth strategy of expanding our usis business we acquired certain credit services business assets and operations of computer sciences corporation “csc credit services” for 10 billion we financed the acquisition with available cash the issuance of 500 million of 330 tenyear senior notes and commercial paper borrowings under our cp program the results of this acquisition are included in our usis segment 

to further broaden our product offerings during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 we completed a number of smaller acquisitions of information services businesses in the european and latin american regions of our international segment the results of these acquisitions are not material 

during the second quarter of 2010 we sold our appro product line generating cash proceeds of approximately 67 million approximately 5 million of the purchase price was paid by the acquirer into an escrow account that was released to us upon the satisfaction of certain conditions over the two year period following the sale we received the final payment of 25 million from the escrow account during the second quarter of 2012 during 2012 we also invested 37 million in our joint venture in russia 

financing activities 



  

credit facility availability   our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which we refer to as the senior credit facility permits us to borrow up to 7500 million  through december 2017 the senior credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes 

  

our 7500 million  cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our senior credit facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility 

  

at december 31 2014  there were no borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility and 3797 million  of commercial paper notes and 15 million  of letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2014  a total of 3688 million  was available under our senior credit facility 

  

at december 31 2014  approximately 75 of our debt was fixed rate and 25 was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consists of our issued commercial paper which bears shortterm interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2014  interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 038 to 060 

  

borrowing and repayment activity   net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and availability allows 

  

the increase in net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily reflects the borrowing of cp notes in the first quarter of 2014 to fund the acquisition of tdx as well as the 2014 payoff of our 150 million 734 notes and 2750 million 445 senior notes outstanding at december 31 2013 with borrowings under our cp program the decrease in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2013 primarily reflects the repayment of 2650 million of cp notes that were outstanding as of december 31 2012 

  

the increase in payments on longterm debt in 2014 reflects the payoff of our 150 million 734 notes and 2750 million 445 senior notes outstanding at december 31 2013 with borrowings under our cp program 

on december 17 2012 we received proceeds of 4992 million from the issuance of tenyear senior notes with a stated interest rate of 330 in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on december 15 and june 15 of each year we used the net proceeds of the sale of the notes to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services in december 2012 

debt covenants   our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limits the amount of subsidiary debt our leverage ratio was 174 at december 31 2014  none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

  

we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt however our 63 senior notes due 2017 33 senior notes due 2022 and 70 senior notes due 2037 together the “senior notes” contain change in control provisions if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

credit ratings   credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2014  the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2013 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment

equity transactions 



  

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows 

  

 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2014  the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 



 

 

 43 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 923 million  and 826 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company 

  

letters of credit and guarantees 

  

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2014  and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2014  

  

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 20  of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1 2011 

at december 31 2014  the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we did not make any contributions to the usrip we contributed 12 million  and 26 million  to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

seasonality 

  

we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our online information solutions and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our financial marketing services business line within usis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

  

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

  

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

  

we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract 

  

many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 

  

we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance 

  

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 

  

the debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and as such is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 

  

judgments and uncertainties —  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

in addition as stated above the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 

  

effects if actual results differ from assumptions —  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 

  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

  

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have eight reporting units comprised of us information solutions which includes part of online information solutions mortgage solutions and financial marketing services identity management part of online information solutions europe latin america canada north america personal solutions verification services and employer services 

  

the goodwill balance at december 31 2014  for our eight reporting units was as follows 



  

qualitative assessments 

we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our us information solutions latin america canada north america personal solutions verification services and employer services reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units 

quantitative assessments   

in determining the fair value the id management and europe reporting units for which we performed a quantitative test we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value 

judgments and uncertainties 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our “competition” discussion in item 1 of this form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information europe and id management have benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type such as experian group limited and fair isaac corporation valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit’s operating result with the comparable companies’ information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple 

  

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

  

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test 

  

growth assumptions 

  

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion and analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 

  

we projected revenue growth in 2015 for our reporting units in completing our 2014 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth the anticipated revenue growth in our reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2015 longterm forecast is not dependent upon meaningful acceleration of global economic growth in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units 

discount rate assumptions 

  

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2014 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated were 105 and 125 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition or participation in less stable geographic markets than the united states such as our europe reporting unit the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit 

  

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

  

the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2014 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for these reporting units exceeded their related carrying value as of september 30 2014 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 

  

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the company’s reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2014 were 34 and 45 

  

no new indicators of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2014 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2014 

  effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable probable reasonably possible or remote 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

  

income taxes 

  

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

  

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2014  233 million  was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 54 million  of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

  

pension and other postretirement plans 

  

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

during 2014 the we adopted the new rp2014 mortality tables and generational projection scale with mp2014 in determining the liability for the us pensions plan this new table along with the change in the discount rate contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31 2014 

judgments and uncertainties  — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is small and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a thirdparty yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2014 the us pension plan investment returns of 80  exceeded the expected return of 75  for the fifth time in five years the expected return for 2015 remains at 75  which is consistent with the rate used for 2014 the crip earned 98  in 2014 also exceeding its expected return of 675  for the fifth time in five years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2015 is 743  which was also the 2014 expected rate 

  

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5564 million at december 31 2014  we do not expect our 2015 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2014 cost see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return  743  at december 31 2014  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2015 by approximately 28 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate  426  at december 31 2014  by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2015 by approximately 07 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 

  

purchase accounting for acquisitions 

  

we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations  which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income 

  

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014  a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2013 would have increased our revenue by 540 million and our pretax operating profit by 181 million for the year ended december 31 2013 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2013 would have increased our revenue by 520 million and our pretax operating profit by 174 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2014 and 2013 

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2014  were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2013 as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2014 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2014 and rates could go either higher or lower 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate commercial paper borrowings we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2014  our weighted average cost of debt was 43 and weightedaverage life of debt was 79 years at december 31 2014  75 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 25 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2014 interest expense by 38 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

governmental regulation 

  

we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business   these laws and regulations may involve privacy data protection intellectual property competition consumer protection anticorruption antibribery employment health taxation or other subjects   in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding the collection protection dissemination and use of nonpublic personal information we have in our possession and consumer financial protection   foreign data and consumer protection privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us   failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements or the adoption of new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect of our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change   in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain   these laws are enforced by federal state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate and in some instances also through private civil litigation there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection which could affect us 

  

summary of us regulation relating to consumer and data protection 

  

our us operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection protection and use of consumer credit and other information and imposing sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data many of these provisions also affect our customers’ use of consumer credit or other data we furnish 

  

examples of the most significant of these laws include but are not limited to the following 

  

federal laws and regulation 

  

 

 

the cfpb may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce these laws and rules in these proceedings the cfpb can obtain cease and desist orders which can include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts as well as other kinds of affirmative relief and monetary penalties ranging from 5000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to 25000 per day for reckless violations and 1 million per day for knowing violations also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties 

  

under udaap the cfpb has exercised its broad powers to examine the acts and practices of entities subject to its jurisdiction and declare those acts or practices to be unfair deceptive or abusive   during 2013 the cfpb announced more than 20 enforcement actions and imposed more than 73 million in civil penalties and 27 billion in restitution 

  

if the cfpb or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have material adverse effect on us   we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in the form 10k   at this time we cannot predict the extent to which the doddfrank act the resulting rules and regulations including those of the cfpb or exercise of its or other enforcement powers will impact our operational results financial condition or liquidity 

  

the cfpb confirmed in 2012 through rulemaking that we are subject to its supervisory examination and enforcement authority   examinations may include the filing of reports reviewing materials we use to offer products and services and our compliance management systems and procedures our cfpb examinations to date have included our regulatory compliance management system and our north america personal solutions business unit directtoconsumer and an examination is planned for our consumer dispute handling process   we are continuing to constructively engage with the cfpb on the results of completed or pending examinations

 item 1a risk factors 

  

all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10k should be considered and read carefully   the risks described below are not the only ones facing us   the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations   this form 10k also contains forwardlooking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties   our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of specific factors including the risks and uncertainties described below 

  

uncertain general economic conditions could materially adversely affect us 

  

although there has been some improvement in overall global macroeconomic conditions in 2013 we and our customers continue to be sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions both inside and outside the us   business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

  

in particular our total mortgagerelated revenue slowed dramatically in the second half of 2013 a trend we expect will continue through the first half of 2014   mortgagerelated revenue was approximately 17 of our consolidated revenue in 2013   for further information see the “business environment and company outlook” and other sections of the management’s discussion and analysis” in this form 10k 

  

the loss of access to credit employment financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

  

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions’ contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange although historically we have not experienced material issues in this regard our data sources could withdraw delay receipt of or increase the cost of their data provided to us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use security breaches or competitive reasons where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share   there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable 

 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

  

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development enhancement promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

  

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability 

  

some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

  

if we do not introduce successful new products services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner our competitiveness and operating results will suffer 

  

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process 

  

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure and uninterrupted operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy 

 

despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures employee training contractual precautions and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions shutdowns or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events 

  

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact although we have not experienced any material breach of cybersecurity if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation significant losses regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 

  

our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

  

we are subject to a number of us and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy data and financial protection   the fair credit reporting act fcra regulates the disclosure of consumer credit reports by consumer reporting agencies and the use of consumer report information by banks and other companies   these regulations are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business foreign data protection privacy consumer protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us   there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us   for example new data protection regulations currently being considered by the european union “eu” legislative bodies propose more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to noneu countries reliance on express consent from data subjects as opposed to assumed or implied consent a right to require data processors to delete personal data and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms 

  

the federal doddfrank act enacted in 2010 established the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has broad powers to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under federal consumer financial laws   the cfpb is authorized to adopt rules supervise and examine and enforce and administer federal consumer laws including most aspects of the fcra and other laws applicable to us and our financial customers and specifically to prohibit “unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices” “udaap”   the doddfrank act also empowers state attorneys general to bring civil actions to enforce the fcra and cfpb regulations   the review of products and practices to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the cfpb   utilizing its udaap authority the cfpb has exercised its broad powers to examine the acts and practices of entities subject to its jurisdiction and declare those acts or practices without notice to be unfair deceptive or abusive   during 2013 the cfpb announced more than 20 enforcement actions and imposed more than 73 million in civil penalties and 27 billion in restitution   we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in this form 10k 

  

in the uk we are subject effective april 1 2014 to a new regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the financial conduct authority the “fca”   the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of all other regulated financial institutions   our core credit reporting “credit reference” and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and “approved person” authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses   the fca has not yet fixed the date when credit reference agencies or collection businesses must apply for this authorization   we are preparing to submit our license applications on or about october 1 2014 which is the earliest date the fca may require applications   although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable licenses are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk 

  

we are devoting substantial compliance legal and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with applicable rules cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state and federal investigations of our business practices any failure by us to comply with or remedy any violations of applicable laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations the imposition of fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed cfpb fca or other rules supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions 

 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue result in significant restitution and fines impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business see “item 1 business – government regulation” in this form 10k 

  

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes 

  

we are regularly involved in claims suits government investigations supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection including purported class action lawsuits   such claims suits government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty   regardless of their outcome such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors   in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services or requiring a change in our business practices products or technologies which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition   the number of consumer lawsuits against us alleging a violation of fcra has increased substantially over the past several years 

  

the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results 

  

during 2013 we acquired trustedid a directtoconsumer identity protection business and several smaller international businesses we also completed the integration of the credit services business and assets we acquired from csc credit services inc on december 28 2012 for 10 billion   in january 2014 we acquired tdx group a debt placement service and debt management platform company in the united kingdom for approximately 327 million   expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition 

  

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our supply and distribution chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

  

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these third party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

  

the impact of consolidation in our customer end markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

  

the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries to which we sell our products and services are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

 

the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases 

  

public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit credit score and other information have become increasingly available particularly through the internet and this trend is expected to continue   governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services particularly in our uscis and personal solutions business units   to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these public sources our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

our retirement and postretirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

  

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

  

if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer 

  

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

  

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

  

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

  

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

  

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

sales outside the us comprised 23 of our net operating revenue in 2013 and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including 

           

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the argentine peso the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies in 2013 a general weakening of foreign currencies in countries where we have operations against the us dollar had a negative impact on our results as reported in us dollars   see “segment financial results – international – latin america and “ canada consumer” and “effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates” in the management’s discussion and analysis section of this form 10k because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

  

we also have a cost method investment in a credit information company in brazil valued in brazilian reais   economic and competition risks within brazil and the company’s ability to successfully implement its strategic and operating plans have had an adverse financial impact on the value of our investment and could result in an additional impairment of the investment 

  

compliance with applicable us and foreign laws and regulations such as anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints data privacy requirements labor laws and anticompetition relations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions   although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur 

  

a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facility and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 

  

the cost of borrowing under our unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on december 19 2017 the “credit agreement” and our ability and the terms under which we may access the credit markets are affected by credit ratings assigned to our indebtedness by the major credit rating agencies   these ratings are premised on our performance under assorted financial metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios and other measures of financial strength business and financial risk industry conditions transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting   our current ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders   however there can be no assurance that our credit ratings or outlook will not be lowered in the future in response to adverse changes in these metrics caused by our operating results or by actions that we take such as incurring additional indebtedness or by returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends or under our share repurchase program   a downgrade of our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing under the credit agreement negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets on advantageous terms or at all negatively affect the trading price of our securities and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

changes in interest rates could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income  

  

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding and adversely affect our net income 

  

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions in which we operate however there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 

  

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

  

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws 

  

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

  

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

state attorney general investigations the attorneys general of the state of ohio and multiple other states commenced an investigation in late 2012 into certain business practices of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies equifax experian and transunion presently there are 32 states participating in this investigation in addition the attorneys general for the states of new york and mississippi have commenced separate investigations into the same or similar matters being reviewed by the multistate attorney general investigation we are cooperating with the attorneys general in these investigations at this time we are unable to predict the outcomes of these investigations including whether the investigations will result in any actions or proceedings being brought against us 

  

cfpb investigation   in february 2014 we received a civil investigative demand a “cid” from the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” as part of its investigation to determine whether nationwide consumer reporting agencies have been or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices relating to the advertising marketing sale or provision of consumer reports credit scores or credit monitoring products in violation of the dodd frank act or the fair credit reporting act   the cid requests the production of documents and answers to written questions   we are cooperating with the cfpb in its investigation and are in discussions with the cfpb regarding our response to the cid   at this time we are unable to predict the outcome of this cfpb investigation including whether the investigation will result in any action or proceeding against us 

  

other equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have strong defenses to and where appropriate will vigorously contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief however we do not believe that these litigation matters will be individually material to our financial condition or results of operations we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process

business environment and company outlook 

  

demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity to consumer credit activity to a lesser extent small commercial credit and marketing activity and to our own initiatives to expand our products and markets served in 2013 in the united states we experienced modest growth in overall economic activity and in general consumer credit a moderate yearoveryear decline in consumer mortgage activity and continuing benefits from our internal product and market initiatives as expected after growing in the first half of 2013 total company mortgage related revenues declined significantly in the second half of 2013 a trend we expect will continue into the first half of 2014 as a result our mortgage solutions business unit’s rate of yearoveryear revenue growth slowed in 2013 and the mortgagerelated components of revenue included in uscis’ online consumer information solutions and workforce solutions’ verification services each declined in absolute terms compared to 2012 while we continue to expect modest growth in overall economic activity and general consumer credit to continue in 2014 mortgage market origination activity is expected to continue declining due to elevated interest rates internationally the environment continues to be challenging as various countries address their particular political fiscal and economic issues in addition recent weakening in foreign exchange rates of certain of the countries in which we participate will reduce growth in revenue and profit when reported in us dollars offsetting these challenges we continue to expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation business execution enterprise growth initiatives technology infrastructure and continuous process improvement will enable us in a modestly growing economy to deliver longterm average organic revenue growth ranging between 6 and 8 with additional growth of 1 to 2 derived from strategic acquisitions consistent with our long term business strategy we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue over time as a result of both operating and financial leverage in 2014 we expect to offset the negative growth in mortgagerelated revenues with strong revenue growth in our core nonmortgage market initiatives 

 

results of operations — 

twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

  

consolidated financial results 

  

operating revenue 

 

  

revenue for 2013 increased by 11 compared to 2012 the growth was driven by the acquisition of csc credit services in the fourth quarter of 2012 “csc credit services acquisition” and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses the first half of 2013 also benefitted from the impact of increased mortgage refinancing activity in the us which as expected began to decline in the second half of 2013 as compared to the prior year this expected decline reduced reported growth rates in our uscis and workforce solutions business units for the second half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2013   for the full year the net decline in mortgage market activity reduced our revenue growth rate by approximately 17   the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 204 million in the 2013 compared to 2012 

  

revenue for 2012 increased by 9 compared to 2011 the deconsolidation of our brazilian business which resulted from the merger of our business into a larger entity during the second quarter of 2011 negatively impacted revenue growth by 354 million in 2012 compared to the prior year while all other revenue increased by 12 compared to 2011 the growth in 2012 was driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives and the impact of increased mortgage refinancing activity in the us the effect of foreign exchange rates in locations other than brazil reduced revenue by 125 million in 2012 compared to the prior year 

  

operating expenses 

  

 

  

cost of services cost of services increased 278 million in 2013 compared to the prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2012 was due primarily to increased salary and benefit costs of 278 million as well as smaller increases across other categories the csc credit services acquisition did not have a material impact on cost of services as this business had already been processed on our systems under our previous affiliate arrangement the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 49 million 

  

cost of services increased 556 million in 2012 compared to the prior year the increase was due primarily to the impact of increased salary expense direct production expenses and contract service expenses of 632 million as well as smaller increases in other expenses to support revenue growth the increase in expense in 2012 was partially offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our cost of services by 34 million 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 423 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase was due primarily to increased salary severance advertising litigation and regulatory compliance expenses of 564 million as well as smaller increases in expense in various categories as we continue to support our business growth   2013 expenses were also impacted by the csc credit services acquisition which contributed approximately 19 million of incremental selling general and administrative expenses some of which are transitional expenses as we integrate the business these expenses were partially offset by the 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 and declines in incentive costs   the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 44 million 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 as compared to 2011 included a 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 the remaining increase was primarily due to increased salary incentive and professional and contractor services expenses of 664 million as well as higher marketing and other expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 27 million 

  

depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was driven by 491 million of incremental expense resulting from the csc credit services acquisition primarily related to amortization of purchased intangibles   the csc credit services acquisition amortization is partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets related to the talx acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013 as well as other miscellaneous purchased intangible assets that fully depreciated during 2013 

  

the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of the talx acquisition in 2007 which fully amortized during the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our brazilian business this decrease was partially offset by our two 2011 acquisitions within workforce solutions 

  

operating income and operating margin 

  

 

  

in 2013 operating income   increased faster than revenue due to margin improvements in our workforce solutions north america personal solutions and north america commercial solutions businesses reflecting rapid revenue growth and the ability to leverage our existing cost base operating income in 2012 was also negatively impacted by the 387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 

  

in 2012 operating expenses increased at a slightly faster rate than revenue and operating income increased at a lower rate than revenue due to a 387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 partially offset by improvements in margins in four of our business segments the overall operating margin decreased in 2012 compared to the prior year period due primarily to the pension settlement in 2012 which negatively impacted margin by 180 basis points and by increases in corporate expenses other than the pension settlement which increased faster than revenues these negative impacts on operating margin were partially offset by improvements in margins in our uscis international workforce solutions and personal solutions businesses driven by revenue growth 

 

other expense net 

  

 

  

interest expense increased in 2013 when compared to 2012 due primarily to the issuance of 500 million of 330 tenyear senior notes in december 2012 to fund the csc credit services acquisition our consolidated debt balance decreased as compared to the prior year as a result of paying down 2650 million of commercial paper during 2013 that was used to partially fund the csc credit services acquisition the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2013 is due to the issuance of the 500 million senior notes at a low interest rate and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year 

  

interest expense increased slightly in 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011 due to the issuance of 500 million of 330 tenyear senior notes in december 2012 our consolidated debt balance increased at december 31 2012 as a result of the issuance of 500 million of 330 senior notes and additional borrowings in the form of commercial paper to partially fund the acquisition of csc credit services the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2012 is due to the issuance of the 500 million senior notes at a low interest rate and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average year to date which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year period 

  

the increase in other expense income net in 2013 is due to the impairment of our cost method investment representing a 15 equity interest in boa vista servicos sa “bvs” recorded in 2013   during the fourth quarter of 2013 the management of bvs revised its nearterm outlook and its operating plans to reflect reduced nearterm market expectations for credit information services in brazil and increased investment needed to achieve its strategic objectives   as a result of these changes and the associated nearterm changes in cash flow expected from the business we recorded a 40 million brazilian reais 170 million impairment of our original investment of 130 million brazilian reais   if the economic growth in brazil remains at lower than trend levels for an extended period or if bvs is unsuccessful in effectively implementing its strategy further writedowns could be recognized in future periods 

  

other expense income net in 2013 also includes 65 million in foreign exchange losses related to dividends declared by our subsidiary in argentina and losses incurred in repatriating these funds   these expenses were partially offset by an increase in our equity in the earnings of our russian joint venture 

  

other expense income net from continuing operations for 2012 decreased 143 million as compared to the prior year periods the decrease is primarily due to the merger of our brazilian business during the second quarter of 2011 on may 31 2011 we completed the merger of our brazilian business with bvs which was accounted for as a sale and deconsolidated in exchange for a 15 equity interest in bvs the “brazilian transaction” we recorded a 103 million pretax loss on the brazilian transaction in other expense income net other expense net was also reduced in 2012 by higher income from our minority investment in russia and interest earned on higher cash balances during 2012 

 

income taxes 

  

 

  

our effective tax rate was 356 for 2013 down from 362 for the same period in 2012   the 2013 rate benefitted by 37 as compared to the 2012 rate due to the unfavorable impact in 2012 of certain onetime effects caused by certain international tax planning implemented during 2012   this was offset by a onetime 28 benefit in 2012 associated with a tax method change approved by tax authorities in 2012   the 2013 effective rate increased by 06 as compared to 2012 due to increases in state income tax rates which become effective in 2013 we expect our effective tax rate in 2014 to be in the range of 36 to 37 

  

our effective rate was 362 for 2012 down from 412 for the same period in 2011 the 2011 rate was higher primarily due to the impact of the brazilian transaction which increased our effective rate by 52 in addition the 2012 rate increased by 47 compared to the prior year due the onetime effects of certain international tax planning implemented during the year this was offset by a 35 onetime benefit associated with a tax method change approved by tax authorities in 2012 in addition the 2012 rate benefitted from certain federal state and international benefits that we do not expect to recur in future years 

  

net income 

  

 

  

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased by 662 million or 24 in 2013 compared to 2012 due to increased operating income in all five of our operating segments net of associated income taxes and higher interest expense as a result of our csc credit services acquisition net income attributable to equifax for 2013 as compared to the prior year also benefitted from increased income from discontinued operations driven by an 184 million gain after tax on the sale of our talent management services and equifax settlement services business lines this gain was primarily the result of an income tax benefit of 181 million including 143 million of current tax benefits   this increase was partially offset by the absence of earnings from the discontinued operations which benefitted the prior year period 

  

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased 365 million or 15 in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to an 114 million increase in operating income in 2012 driven by improvements in four of our five business segments and the 278 million loss recorded on the brazilian transaction reflected in other expense and income tax expense as previously described in 2011 for which no comparable losses were incurred in 2012 

 

segment financial results 

  

us consumer information solutions 

  

 

  

us consumer information solutions revenue increased 17 in 2013 as compared to the prior year the csc credit services acquisition contributed 14 of the revenue growth in 2013   the remaining growth resulted from midsingle digit percentage growth from core nonmortgage products and from strategic product market penetration and pricing initiatives in the mortgage market more than offsetting a 2 decline from lower mortgage market activity in 2013 

  

the increase in revenue in 2012 as compared to 2011 was due to the impact of a high level of mortgage activity as well as certain new product pricing and market penetration initiatives implemented during 2011 and into 2012 

  

ocis revenue for 2013 increased 14 when compared to the prior year this increase was driven primarily by the incremental revenue from the csc credit services acquisition as compared to the prior year excluding the csc credit services acquisition revenue increased 1 in 2013 as compared to a year ago a 3 decline in 2013 in organic credit report transaction volume compared to the prior year was due to a decline in mortgagerelated credit report volume and lower volume from select high volume but lower priced accounts in the financial services market as well as changes in usage in the telecommunications sector   this was offset by higher average unit revenue due to pricing initiatives and more favorable mix 

  

2012 revenue increased 17 when compared to the prior year about half of the increase resulted from increased volume and improved pricing in mortgage enduse markets while the other half came predominantly from pricing and new product initiatives for the year core credit decision transaction volume increased by 4 while average revenue per transaction increased by 9 resulting from the increase in mortgage volume at higher than average pricing as a share of our overall mix and from specific market segment pricing initiatives while the remainder of our 17 growth came from products billed on a subscription basis and other revenue sources 

  

mortgage solutions revenue increased 21 in 2013 when compared to the prior year period due primarily to the incremental revenue resulting from the csc credit services acquisition which contributed 18 of the growth in 2013 revenue also benefitted from increased new product sales and market share gains from existing customers revenue increased in 2012 when compared to 2011 due primarily to increased sales in core mortgage reporting services as a result of higher mortgage refinancings stimulated by historically low mortgage interest rates the sale of new mortgage information products which help lenders better manage risk and growth in settlement services revenue as a result of the favorable market conditions and increased market share from existing customers 

  

consumer financial marketing services revenue increased 360 million or 24 in 2013 as compared to 2012 revenue related to the csc credit services acquisition contributed approximately 11 of the revenue growth in 2013 with the remainder coming from account acquisition and analytical services products delivered to members of our key client program revenue also benefitted from the collection of certain reserved billings related to both 2013 and 2012   revenue decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011 resulting from a decline in demand for wealthbased consumer information services due to reductions in their use for credit marketing by some large financial institutions this decrease was partially offset in by growth in traditional creditbased prescreen revenue and increased portfolio management revenue 

  

us consumer information solutions operating margin uscis operating margin decreased to 393 in 2013 as compared to 2012 margin expansion from revenue growth was more than offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense and certain transitional expenses both related to the csc credit services acquisition and increased investments in growth initiatives the increased depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of the additional 491 million in 2013 of acquisitionrelated amortization expense related to the csc credit services acquisition in 2012 uscis operating margins increased 60 basis points to 397 due to the benefits of strong revenue growth in a business with significant fixed costs

latin america    revenue increased 4 in 2013 as compared to the prior year in local currency revenue growth was 12 in 2013 as compared to 2012 driven most significantly by growth in argentina and to a lesser extent growth in paraguay ecuador and uruguay   this growth was offset by a modest decline in chile in the first half of 2013 due to regulatory changes in the allowable uses of credit information which the impact on year over year comparisons was anniversaried late in the first half of 2013   local currency fluctuations against the us dollar negatively impacted revenue by 156 million or 8 in 2013 principally due to depreciation in the foreign exchange rate of the argentine peso

international operating margin operating margin decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 as the revenue growth was more than offset by increased investments in new business and strategic initiatives across most geographies in order to support future revenue growth   operating margin increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business whose margins had declined in recent periods slightly offset by restructuring expenses in the third quarter of 2012 the 2011 operating margins were also impacted by increased investments in new product development and increased sales force particularly in brazil prior to the deconsolidation of the business 

  

workforce solutions 

  

 

  

verification services revenue increased 8 in 2013 compared to the prior year period   in 2013 as compared to 2012 17 growth in nonmortgage verification revenue was offset by a 1 decline in mortgagerelated verification revenue due to the expected decline in mortgage market activity in the second half of 2013   the growth in nonmortgage verification revenue was primarily a result of increased revenue mostly related to government preemployment and consumer finance customer segments 

  

revenue increased 34 in 2012 compared to 2011 due to 36 growth in mortgagerelated verification revenue resulting from the strong level of mortgage refinancing activity during 2012 18 growth in nonmortgage verification revenue and the benefit of our third quarter 2011 acquisition of datavision resources 

  

employer services 2013 revenue increased 6 as compared to 2012 revenue growth due to the renewal of the federal work opportunity tax credit program at the end of 2012 and growth in our transactionbased complementary services business was partially offset by lower overall claims activity in our unemployment cost management business and the expiration of the hire act tax credit 

  

revenue decreased 3 in 2012 as compared to 2011 revenue declined in our tax management services business due to lower overall claims activity in our unemployment cost management business and beginning in the third quarter the delay in the renewal of the federal work opportunity tax credit program which was renewed on december 31 2012 this decline was partially offset by growth achieved in our transactionbased complementary services 

  

workforce solutions operating margin operating margin for 2013 increased significantly compared to 2012 margin expansion was driven by strong revenue growth in products with a high degree of fixed costs strategic initiatives implemented to reduce costs and from lower acquisitionrelated amortization operating margin for 2012 increased as compared to 2011 the increase in margin was driven by the revenue growth during the year in products with a high degree of fixed costs

revenue increased 12 in 2013 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased direct to consumer equifaxbranded usbased subscription service revenue which was up 10 in 2013 as well as strong growth of services in the canadian market and the acquisition of trustedid completed in the third quarter of 2013 the increase in the direct to consumer equifaxbranded usbased subscription service revenue was driven by new product sales and higher average revenue per subscriber reflecting additional features in the equifax product offering as well as growth in subscribers transaction sales breach services and revenue from traditional partners each declined slightly operating margin increased in 2013 as compared to the prior year due to lower monitoring and credit file expenses resulting from the csc credit services acquisition partially offset by the increased investment in sales and marketing expenses and the impact of the third quarter 2013 acquisition   looking forward revenue from us subscription services is expected to grow more slowly due to increased competition from free services and potential changes due to the regulatory environment 

  

the increase in revenue in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased direct to consumer equifaxbranded subscription service revenue which was up 16 in 2012 the increase was driven by higher average revenue per subscriber due to new product offerings and better market segmentation and to a lesser extent by higher subscription sales resulting in higher average subscriber counts operating margin increased slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to higher revenue partially offset by an increase in marketing

revenue increased 6 in us dollars and 7 in local currency in 2013 as compared to 2012 transactionbased revenue serving credit risk needs of our customers which represents approximately 60 of our revenue grew 6 as compared to the prior year projectoriented revenue increased 8 in 2013 due to stronger demand for risk and marketing services projects as well as new product offerings local currency fluctuations against the us dollar negatively impacted revenue by 08 million or 1 operating margin increased for 2013 compared to the prior year as revenue growth in a business with significant fixed costs outpaced our investments in the business 

  

revenue increased 1 in 2012 both in reported currency and local currency as compared to 2011 transactionbased revenue serving credit risk needs of our customers which represents approximately 60 of our revenue grew 5 in 2012 as compared to the prior year this growth was offset by a 5 decline in projectoriented revenue as customers delayed or canceled certain small business marketing programs given the uncertain environment for small businesses operating margin decreased in 2012 due to marginal revenue growth combined with a 7 increase in operating expenses as the business continues to invest in its longer term strategy despite the current slowdown in demand for marketing services 

  

general corporate expense 

  

 

  

our general corporate expenses are costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction such as shared services administrative legal equity compensation costs and restructuring expenses general corporate expenses decreased by 285 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the 387 million pension settlement recorded in 2012 partially offset by higher salary benefit and restructuring costs as well as spending to support corporate growth and infrastructure initiatives 

  

general corporate expenses increased by 689 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the 387 million pension settlement recorded in 2012 along with higher salary and incentive costs spending to support corporate growth and infrastructure initiatives and costs associated with completing the csc credit services acquisition partially offset by lower technology costs 

 

liquidity and financial condition 

  

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 

  

sources and uses of cash 

  

funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures interest payments debt payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the senior credit facility as described below at december 31 2013 7486 million was available to borrow under our senior credit facility our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement 

  

information about our cash flows by category is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

  

 

  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities for 2013 increased by 700 million compared to 2012 cash provided from net income excluding the impact of the 2013 divestitures the impairment of our cost method investment in 2013 the impact of the 2012 pension settlement and adjusting for an increase in amortization expense resulting from the csc credit services acquisition increased 653 million this increase in cash from operations was driven by the increase in net income in 2013 as compared to 2012 

  

cash provided by operating activities for 2012 increased by 876 million over the prior year cash provided from net income excluding the impact of the 2012 pension settlement and the 2011 impact of divestitures increased 515 million the remaining increase in cash from operations was driven primarily by changes in net working capital and other balance sheet changes most notably a 520 million reduction in cash used in current liabilities reflecting in part an increase in accrued salaries and incentives partially offset by a change in accrued taxes including certain items related to the merger of our business in brazil into bvs the increase was also driven by 40 million of pension contributions in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a 301 million reduction in cash related to deferred income taxes and a 249 million use of cash related to increased prepaid assets and other current assets 

 

fund transfer limitations the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments such as argentina these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends we currently hold 980 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries 

  

investing activities 

  

 

  

our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance licensing of standard software applications investing in system reliability security and disaster recovery enhancements and updating or expanding our office facilities 

  

capital expenditures in 2013 increased from 2012 as we are continuing to invest in new products and technology infrastructure capital expenditures in 2012 were lower than 2011 primarily due to the purchase of a building in our workforce solutions segment during the first quarter of 2011 

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments

financing activities 

  

 

  

credit facility availability our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which we refer to as the senior credit facility permits us to borrow up to 7500 million through december 2017 the senior credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes 

  

our 7500 million cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our senior credit facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility 

  

at december 31 2013 there were no borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility and no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2013 a total of 7486 million was available under our senior credit facility 

  

at december 31 2013 approximately 81 of our debt was fixed rate and 19 was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consists of our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates generally bearing interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor and of our issued commercial paper which bears shortterm interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2013 interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 187 to 204 

  

borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program when available 

  

the decrease in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2013 primarily reflects the repayment of 2650 million of cp notes that were outstanding as of december 31 2012 the change in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2012 primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of 2650 million of cp notes as of december 31 2012 that was used to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services 

  

on december 17 2012 we received proceeds of 4992 million from the issuance of tenyear senior notes with a stated interest rate of 330 in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on december 15 and june 15 of each year we used the net proceeds of the sale of the notes to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services in december 2012 

 

debt covenants our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limits the amount of subsidiary debt our leverage ratio was 174 at december 31 2013 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

  

we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt however our senior notes contain change in control provisions if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

  

credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

  

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2013 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2012 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment

equity transactions 

  

 

  

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were as follows 

  

   

   

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2013 the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 

  

 

  

   

   

 

 

   

   

 

 

offbalance sheet transactions 

  

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

  

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 826 million and 707 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company 

  

letters of credit and guarantees 

  

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2013 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2013 

  

benefit plans 

  

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 20 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1 2011 

  

at december 31 2013 the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we did not make any contributions to the usrip   we contributed 26 million and 37 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

  

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

  

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

  

seasonality 

  

we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our north america commercial business and the consumer financial marketing services business line within uscis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest 

 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

  

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

  

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

  

revenue recognition 

  

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

  

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

 

the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

  

we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract 

  

many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 

  

we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance 

  

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 

  

deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 

  

judgments and uncertainties — each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

  

in addition the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 

 

effects if actual results differ from assumptions — we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 

  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

  

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have nine reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes part of online consumer information solutions mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services identity management part of online consumer information solutions europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services and employer services 

  

the goodwill balance at december 31 2013 for our nine reporting units was as follows 

  

 

  

we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our consumer information solutions europe canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services and employer services reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units 

  

judgments and uncertainties — in determining the fair value the id management and latin america reporting units for which we performed a quantitative test we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value 

 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our “competition” discussion in item 1 of our 2013 form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information latin america and id management have benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type such as experian group limited and fair isaac corporation valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit’s operating result with the comparable companies’ information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple 

  

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

  

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test 

  

growth assumptions 

  

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion  analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 

  

we projected revenue growth in 2014 for our reporting units in completing our 2013 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth the anticipated revenue growth in our reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2014 longterm forecast is not dependent upon meaningful acceleration of global economic growth in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units 

 

discount rate assumptions 

  

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2013 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated were 11 and 17 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition or participation in less stable geographic markets than the united states such as our latin america reporting unit the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit 

  

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

  

the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2013 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for these reporting units exceeded their related carrying value as of september 30 2013 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 

  

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the company’s reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2013 were 27 and 40 

  

no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2013 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2013 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

 

loss contingencies 

  

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote 

  

judgments and uncertainties — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

  

income taxes 

  

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

  

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

  

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2013 226 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 60 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

  

pension and other postretirement plans 

  

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

  

judgments and uncertainties — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is small and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 

 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2013 the us pension plan investment returns of 114 exceeded the expected return of 75 for the fourth time in the last five years the expected return for 2014 remains at 75 which is consistent with the rate used for 2013 the crip earned 135 in 2013 also exceeding its expected return of 675 for the fourth time in five years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2014 is 743 which was also the 2013 expected rate 

  

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5548 million at december 31 2013 we do not expect our 2014 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2013 cost see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 743 at december 31 2013 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2014 by approximately 28 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 507 at december 31 2013 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2014 by approximately 08 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 

  

purchase accounting for acquisitions 

  

we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations  which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income 

  

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations 

  

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

  

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

  

for the year ended december 31 2013 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2013 would have increased our revenue by 520 million and our pretax operating profit by 174 million for the year ended december 31 2012 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2012 would have increased our revenue by 494 million and our pretax operating profit by 167 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2013 and 2012 

  

on average across our mix of international businesses foreign currencies at december 31 2013 were weaker against the us dollar than the average foreign exchange rates that prevailed across the full year 2013   as a result if foreign exchange rates were unchanged throughout 2014 foreign exchange translation would reduce growth as reported in us dollars   as foreign exchange rates change daily there can be no assurance that foreign exchange rates will remain constant throughout 2014 and rates could go either higher or lower 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate longterm senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our 2014 fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2013 our weighted average cost of debt was 46 and weightedaverage life of debt was 93 years at december 31 2013 81 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 19 was variable rate after giving effect to the interest rate swaps on our 2014 bonds occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2013 interest expense by 28 million 

  

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

 item 9a   controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of equifax’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2013   the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2013 and due to the fact the company did not appropriately evaluate the identified deficiency discussed below in internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for acquisitionrelated intangible assets in determining whether it was a material weakness until after december 31 2013 the chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective 

  

subsequent to december 31 2013 management has designed additional disclosure controls and procedures which were implemented in january 2014   our disclosure controls and procedures now include a formal evaluation of all identified deficiencies to consider the materiality of the transactions subject to a deficient controls performance ie the pervasiveness of the deficiency and the likelihood that the deficiency could potentially result in a material misstatement to the financial statements the existence of mitigating controls and the aggregation of deficiencies to evaluate if there is a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting requiring disclosure 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of our chairman and chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that 

  

     

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of equifax’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 1992 framework based on this assessment using those criteria our management concluded that as of december 31 2013 equifax’s internal control over financial reporting was effective the effectiveness of equifax’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 has been audited by ernst  young llp equifax’s independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in part ii item 8 of this form 10k on page 55 

  

during 2013 the company acquired three businesses as permitted by securities and exchange commission guidance the scope of our section 404 evaluation for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 does not include the internal controls over financial reporting over the acquired operations   these acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisitions   the acquisitions were not material to the 2013 consolidated financial statements 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting   

  

during the fourth quarter of 2013 management determined that a deficiency in internal controls over financial reporting existed at december 31 2012   this deficiency in the internal controls over financial reporting was in our review controls in accounting for business combinations   specifically those controls did not adequately consider the relevant accounting literature as it relates to the identification and recording of intangible assets   the company has concluded that the control deficiency was a material weakness that existed as of december 31 2012   this deficiency which was later identified as a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting was identified in conjunction with identifying and correcting immaterial errors in our third quarter form 10q related to measurement and determination of useful lives for intangible assets acquired in a business combination consummated in 2012 the company undertook the necessary procedures discussed below to remediate the control deficiency described above during the fourth quarter of 2013 

  

 

  

the material weakness had no material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 based on the identification of the deficiency the company designed and implemented in the fourth quarter of 2013 remediation measures to address the deficiency described above the following actions which the company believes have remediated the deficiency were completed prior to december 31 2013 

  

   

   

there have been no other changes in internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the foregoing evaluation that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

the market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change our competitors vary widely in size and the nature of the products and services they offer sources of competition are numerous and include the following

 

  

  

  

while we believe that none of our competitors offers the same mix of products and services as we do certain competitors may have a larger share of particular geographic or product markets or operate in geographic areas where we do not currently have a presence

 

we assess the principal competitive factors affecting our markets to include product attributes such as quality depth coverage adaptability scalability interoperability functionality and easeofuse product price technical performance access to unique proprietary databases availability in application service provider or asp format quickness of response flexibility and client services and support effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts existing market penetration new product innovation and our reputation as a trusted steward of information

 

markets and clients 

 

our products and services serve clients across a wide range of industries including financial services mortgage human resources consumer commercial telecommunications retail automotive utilities brokerage healthcare and insurance industries as well as state and federal governments we also serve consumers directly our revenue stream is highly diversified with our largest client providing only 2 of total revenue the following table summarizes the various enduser markets we serve

 





 

  

  

we market our products and services primarily through our own direct sales organization that is organized around sales teams that focus on client segments typically aligned by vertical markets and geography sales groups are based in our headquarters in atlanta georgia and field offices located in the us and in the countries where we have operations we also market our products and services through indirect channels including alliance partners joint ventures and other resellers in addition we sell through direct mail and various websites such as wwwequifaxcom

revenue from international clients including end users and resellers amounted to 24 of our total revenue in 2012 26 of our total revenue in 2011 and 27 of our total revenue in 2010

 





 

technology and intellectual property 

 

we generally seek protection under federal state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by registration under applicable trademark laws or by prosecution of patent applications we own a number of patents registered in the us and several in foreign countries we also have certain registered trademarks in the us and in many foreign countries the most important of these are “equifax” “the work number” and variations thereof these trademarks are used in connection with most of our product lines and services we believe that in the aggregate the rights under these patents and trademarks are generally important to our operations and competitive position but we do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents or trademark however certain company trademarks which contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services including but not limited to the “equifax” trademark are an integral part of our business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us

 

we license other companies to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights we own or control primarily as core components of our products and services on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards and that are designed to protect our interest in our intellectual property other companies license us to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control none of which is material to our business except for a license from fair isaac corporation relating to certain creditscoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from them this license has a fiveyear term expiring in june 2013 and provides for usagebased fees historically we have renewed this license and expect the renewal in 2013 to not have a material impact on our business additionally the licenses do not contain early termination provisions except for standard provisions providing the right to terminate in the event of breach by the other party we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations

 

information security and government regulation 

 

safeguarding the privacy and security of consumer credit information whether delivered online or in an offline format is a top priority we recognize the importance of secure online transactions and we maintain physical administrative and technical safeguards reasonably designed to protect personal and business identifiable information we have security protocols and measures in place to protect information from unauthorized access or alteration these measures include internal and external firewalls physical security and technological security measures and encryption of certain data

 

our databases are regularly updated by information provided by financial institutions telecommunications companies utilities other trade credit providers employers public records vendors and government agencies various laws and regulations govern the collection and use of this information these laws and existing and proposed regulations impact how we are able to provide information to our customers and may significantly increase our compliance costs we are subject to differing laws and regulations depending on where we operate

 

us data and privacy protection 

 

our us operations are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection protection and use of consumer credit and other information and imposing sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data many of these provisions also affect our customers’ use of consumer credit or other data we furnish the information underlying our north america commercial services business is less regulated than the other portions of our business

 

examples include

 

  





 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 





 

with the appointment of a cfpb director by the president on january 4 2012 the cfpb has begun to exercise authority to define unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices and to require reports and conduct examinations of these entities for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial protections laws obtaining information about the activities and compliance systems or procedures of such entities and detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services the exercise of this supervisory authority must be riskbased meaning that the cfpb will identify nonbanks for examination based on the risk they pose to consumers including consideration of the entity’s asset size transaction volume risk to consumers existing oversight by state authorities and any other factors that the cfpb determines to be relevant in july 2012 the cfpb issued a rule designating certain consumer reporting agencies including us as within its nonbank supervision program for “larger participants” our first examination as a credit reporting firm which focused on our regulatory compliance management system was completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 

 

as a “larger participant” we are subject to cfpb supervisory examination and enforcement authority such examination may include the filing of reports reviewing materials we use to offer products and services and our compliance management systems and procedures when a nonbank is in violation of federal consumer financial laws including the cfpb’s own rules the cfpb may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce these laws and rules in these proceedings the cfpb can obtain cease and desist orders which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts as well as other kinds of affirmative relief and monetary penalties ranging from 5000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to 25000 per day for reckless violations and 1 million per day for knowing violations also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties if the cfpb or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have a material adverse effect on us 

 

at this time we cannot predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting rules and regulations including those of the cfpb will impact the us economy and our products and services

 

compliance with these new laws and regulations may require changes in the way we conduct our business and will result in additional compliance costs which could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity

 





 

international data and privacy protection 

 

we are subject to data protection privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the various foreign countries where we do business including without limitation the following

 

  

  

  

   





  

tax management services 

 

the tax management services business within our workforce solutions segment is potentially impacted by changes in us tax laws or interpretations for example those pertaining to work opportunity tax credits and unemployment compensation claims

  

environmental regulation 

 

we are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety health and environmental protection compliance with these laws and regulations has not in the past had any material effect on our earnings capital expenditures or competitive position however the effect of such compliance in the future cannot be predicted we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable federal state and local safety health and environmental regulations

 

personnel 

 

equifax employed approximately 7000 employees in 18 countries as of december 31 2012 none of our us employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and no work stoppages have been experienced pursuant to local laws certain of our employees in argentina and spain are covered under governmentmandated collective bargaining regulations that govern general salary and compensation matters basic benefits and hours of work

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business faces a variety of risks and uncertainties including those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business financial results or results of operations may be adversely impacted these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k

 





 

weakness in consumer lending activity could materially adversely affect us 

 

business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available

 

the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions’ contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share

 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins

 

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability

 

some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins

 





 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process

 

the impact of consolidation in the financial services mortgage retail telecommunications and other markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

 

the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us

 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

 

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy

 

despite our substantial investment in security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events

 

we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact although we have not experienced any material breach of cybersecurity if one or more of such events occur this potentially could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation significant losses regulatory fines penalties or reputational damage any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows competitive position financial condition or results of operations our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention

 





 

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our supply and distribution chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these third party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty

 

changes in interest rates and credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income  

 

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase our cost of capital and hurt our competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect our returns as well

  

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

  

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perception concerning the instability of the euro the potential reintroduction of individual currencies with the eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financing 

  

as a result of the debt crisis concerns have been raised regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency and their ability to meet future financial obligations the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro be dissolved entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the companys eurodenominated assets and obligations particularly in portugal spain and ireland and the future profitability or even viability of our operations in those countries in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on global economies and capital markets generally and more specifically on the companys business in europe and the ability of the company and its customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all and on the demand for our products and services

  

the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results 

 

during 2012 we completed the acquisition of various businesses in separate transactions including certain business assets and the operations of computer sciences corporation “csc credit services” and several smaller international acquisitions expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition

 





 

our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

 

our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to privacy and consumer data protection health and safety tax labor and environmental regulations see “item 1 business – information security and government regulation” in this form 10k these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 

 

these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business

 

as in the united states legislation regarding the availability or use of consumer and commercial data has been and continues to be proposed from time to time in various foreign countries in which we have operations most notably in certain latin american and european union countries these proposals have in some cases had the potential to expand the availability or uses of information and in other cases had the potential to restrict the availability or use of information we currently maintain accordingly such possible regulatory action could either increase or decrease our potential revenue and profits

 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer

 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all

 





  

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

 

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage

 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue

  

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

sales outside the us comprise 24 of our net operating revenue and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are increasingly located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions trade protection measures data privacy and consumer protection regulations difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner implementation of exchange controls and geopolitical instability including terrorism and war

 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the argentine peso the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results

 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer products in one or more countries and could adversely affect our reputation our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will not violate our policies

 

 





 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees

 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us 

 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including putative class action claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially affect our financial condition and operating results

  

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

 

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws

  

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

 

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

equifax certain of its subsidiaries and other persons have been named as parties in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in connection with the operation of equifax’s businesses in most cases plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief these actions include the following

 

california bankruptcy litigation in consolidated actions filed in the us district court for the central district of california captioned terri n white et al v equifax information services llc jose hernandez v equifax information services llc kathryn l pike v equifax information services llc and jose l acosta jr et al v trans union llc et al  plaintiffs asserted that equifax violated federal and state law the fcra the california credit reporting act and the california unfair competition law by failing to follow reasonable procedures to determine whether credit accounts are discharged in bankruptcy including the method for updating the status of an account following a bankruptcy discharge on august 20 2008 the district court approved a settlement agreement and release providing for certain changes in the procedures used by defendants to record discharges in bankruptcy on consumer credit files that settlement resolved claims for injunctive relief but not plaintiffs’ claims for damages on may 7 2009 the district court issued an order preliminarily approving an agreement to settle remaining class claims the district court subsequently deferred final approval of the settlement and required the settling parties to send a supplemental notice to those class members who filed a claim and objected to the settlement or opted out with the cost for the renotice to be deducted from the plaintiffs’ counsel fee award mailing of the supplemental notice was completed on february 15 2011 the deadline for this group of settling plaintiffs to provide additional documentation to support their damage claims or to optout of the settlement was march 31 2011 on july 15 2011 following another approval hearing the district court approved the settlement several objecting plaintiffs subsequently filed notices of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit the parties have filed their briefs and the case is currently pending with oral arguments scheduled for march 2013

  

other equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have strong defenses to and where appropriate will vigorously contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief however we do not believe that these litigation matters will be individually material to our financial condition or results of operations we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process

operational and financial highlights 

 

  

  

business environment and company outlook 

  

we expect us mortgage refinancing activity to remain strong through the first half of 2013 but then trend down in the second half of 2013 we also expect a continuation of modest economic growth in most of our served markets the environment will continue to be challenging as various countries deal with their particular political fiscal and economic issues however we continue to expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation business execution enterprise growth initiatives technology infrastructure strategic acquisitions and continuous process improvement will enable us in a modestly growing economy to deliver long term average organic revenue growth ranging between 6 and 8 with additional growth of 1 to 2 derived from strategic acquisitions we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue as a result of both operating and financial leverage in 2013 we expect total revenue growth from continuing operations of 10 to 12 as the impact of our acquisition of the csc credit services business will more than outweigh the negative impact of the expected decline in us mortgage volumes

 





 

results of operations — 

twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

consolidated financial results 

 

operating revenue 

 

  

revenue from continuing operations increased by 10 compared to 2011 the deconsolidation of our brazilian business which resulted from the merger of our business into a larger entity during the second quarter of 2011 negatively impacted revenue growth by 354 million in 2012 compared to the prior year while all other revenue increased by 12 compared to 2011 the growth in 2012 was driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives and the impact of increased mortgage refinancing activity in the us the effect of foreign exchange rates in locations other than brazil reduced revenue by 125 million in 2012 compared to the prior year

 

revenue from continuing operations increased by 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 the deconsolidation of our brazilian business which resulted from the merger of our business into bvs during the second quarter of 2011 negatively impacted revenue by 487 million compared to the prior year while all other revenue increased by 8 compared to 2010 primarily driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives across each of our businesses the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates in locations other than brazil did not have a material impact on revenue

 

 





 

operating expenses 

 

  

cost of services cost of services from continuing operations increased 703 million in 2012 compared to the prior year the increase was due primarily to the impact of increased salary expense direct production expenses and contract service expenses of 797 million as well as smaller increases in other expenses to support revenue growth the increase in expense in 2012 was partially offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our cost of services by 34 million

 

the slight increase in cost of services from continuing operations in 2011 when compared to 2010 was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and benefits expense and contract services expenses of 311 million and by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by 72 million largely offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business

 

selling general and administrative expenses the increase in selling general and administrative expense from continuing operations in 2012 as compared to 2011 included a 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 the remaining increase was primarily due to increased salary incentive and professional and contractor services expenses of 702 million as well as higher marketing and other expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expense by 27 million

 

selling general and administrative expense from continuing operations increased 571 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased salary and incentive expense of 333 million higher advertising expenses of 91 million and higher severance costs offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our selling general and administrative expense by 52 million in 2011

 

depreciation and amortization the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of the talx acquisition in 2007 which fully amortized during the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our brazilian business this decrease was partially offset by our two 2011 acquisitions within workforce solutions

 

depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to 66 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to our fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of anakam and our 2011 acquisitions partially offset by the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of talx in 2007 which fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our brazilian business

 





 

operating income and operating margin 

 

  

in 2012 operating expenses increased at a slightly faster rate than revenue and operating income increased at a lower rate than revenue due to a 387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 partially offset by improvements in margins in four of our business segments the overall operating margin decreased in 2012 compared to the prior year period due primarily to the pension settlement in 2012 which negatively impacted margin by 180 basis points and by increases in corporate expenses other than the pension settlement which increased faster than revenues these negative impacts on operating margin were partially offset by improvements in margins in our uscis international workforce solutions and personal solutions businesses driven by revenue growth

 

operating income from continuing operations for 2011 increased faster than revenue due to operating leverage from revenue growth and business mix as well as the deconsolidation of brazil which reduced reported revenue but which had little impact on operating profit because it had been operating near breakeven these factors resulted in operating margin improvement of 90 basis points to 240 compared to 2010

 

other expense net 

 

 nm  not meaningful

 

interest expense increased slightly in 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011 due to the issuance of 500 million of 330 tenyear senior notes in december 2012 our consolidated debt balance has increased at december 31 2012 as a result of the issuance of 500 million of 330 senior notes and additional borrowings in the form of commercial paper to fund the acquisition of csc credit services the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2012 is due to the issuance of the 500 million senior notes at a lower interest rate and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average year to date which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year period

 

interest expense decreased slightly in 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010 due to lower average debt balances outstanding for 2011 as compared to 2010 our consolidated debt balance increased at december 31 2011 as a result of additional borrowings in the form of commercial paper on which interest rates and accordingly interest expense were very low the increase in the average cost of debt for 2011 is due to less low rate commercial paper outstanding on average throughout the year which caused the average cost of debt to increase as compared to the prior year period

 

other expense income net from continuing operations for 2012 decreased 143 million as compared to the prior year periods the decrease is primarily due to the merger of our brazilian business during the second quarter of 2011 on may 31 2011 we completed the merger of our brazilian business with boa vista servicos sa “bvs” which was accounted for as a sale and deconsolidated in exchange for a 15 equity interest in bvs “the brazilian transaction” we recorded a 103 million pretax loss on the brazilian transaction in other expense income net other expense net was also reduced in 2012 by higher income from our minority investment in russia and interest earned of higher cash balances during 2012

 





 

other expense income net from continuing operations for 2011 increased 90 million as compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to the merger of our brazilian business during the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a 103 million pretax loss on the brazilian transaction in other expense income net 

 

income taxes 

 

  

our effective rate was 362 for 2012 down from 412 for the same period in 2011 the 2011 rate was higher primarily due to the impact of the brazilian transaction which increased our effective rate by 52 in addition the 2012 rate increased by 47 compared to the prior year due the onetime effects of certain international tax planning implemented during the year this is offset by a 35 onetime benefit associated with a tax method change approved by tax authorities in 2012 in addition the 2012 rate benefited from certain federal state and international benefits that we do not expect to recur in future years we expect our effective tax rate in 2013 to be in the range of 35 to 37

 

our effective rate was 412 for 2011 up from 351 for the same period in 2010 the 2011 rate was higher primarily due to the impact of the brazilian transaction which increased our effective rate by 52 in addition the 2010 rate benefited from certain state benefits that did not recur in 2011 this is partially offset by a cumulative income tax benefit resulting from the recognition of an income tax deduction related to several prior years

 

net income 

 

  

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased 406 million or 17 in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to an 180 million increase in operating income in 2012 driven by improvements in four of our five business segments and the 278 million loss recorded on the brazilian transaction reflected in other expense and income tax expense as previously described in 2011 for which no comparable losses were incurred in 2012

 

consolidated income from continuing operations decreased by 31 million or 1 in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to the 278 million loss recorded on the brazilian transaction reflected in other expense and income tax expense partially offset by operating income growth of 410 million due to revenue growth net of associated income taxes consolidated income attributable to equifax decreased 338 million in 2011 in addition to improved operating results and the loss on the brazilian transaction described above 2010 consolidated income from continuing operations included transaction gains from discontinued operations of 272 million which did not recur in 2011

 





 

segment financial results 

 

us consumer information solutions 

 

  

us consumer information solutions revenue increased 16 in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to the impact of a high level of mortgage activity as well as certain new product pricing and market penetration initiatives implemented during 2011 and into 2012 we expect that the additional revenue in 2013 resulting from the acquisition of csc credit services will more than offset an anticipated decline in mortgagerelated revenue as a result of an expected market decline in mortgage origination volumes the increase in revenue for 2011 as compared to 2010 was a result of growth across all of our uscis business lines

 

ocis 2012 revenue increased 17 when compared to the prior year about half of the increase resulted from increased volume and improved pricing in mortgage enduse markets while the other half came predominately from pricing and new product initiatives for the year core credit decision transaction volume increased by 4 while average revenue per transaction increased by 9 resulting from the increase in mortgage volume at higher than average pricing as a share of our overall mix and from specific market segment pricing initiatives while the remainder of our 17 growth came from products billed on a subscription basis and other revenue sources the increase in revenue for 2011 as compared to 2010 was driven by increased market volume particularly in the credit card and auto markets new customer wins new service introductions and select pricing actions in subscription and wholesale arrangements an 11 increase in core credit decision transaction volumes was partially offset by lower average price per transaction for our transaction based revenue

 

mortgage solutions revenue increased 35 in 2012 when compared to 2011 due primarily to increased sales in core mortgage reporting services as a result of higher mortgage refinancings stimulated by historically low mortgage interest rates the sale of newer mortgage information products which help lenders better manage risk and growth in settlement services revenue as a result of the favorable market conditions and increased market share from existing customers revenue increased in 2011 primarily due to increased sales of settlement services as a result of increased market share from existing customers partially offset by the declines in core mortgage reporting services due to lower refinancing activity as compared to the comparable periods of 2010

 

consumer financial marketing services revenue decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011 resulting from a decline in demand for wealthbased consumer information services due to reductions in their use for credit marketing by some large financial institutions this decrease was partially offset in by growth in traditional creditbased prescreen revenue and increased portfolio management revenue revenue for 2011 increased as compared to 2010 due to continued growth in creditbased prescreen and portfolio management revenue as well as strong market penetration of wealthbased consumer information services

 

us consumer information solutions operating margin uscis operating margins increased 110 basis points to 373 in 2012 due to the benefits of strong revenue growth in a business with significant fixed costs in 2011 improved margins in online credit services and cfms resulting from solid revenue growth were offset by lower margins in mortgage solutions due to less favorable product mix and by expense investment and increased acquisitionrelated amortization associated with our fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of anakam

international operating margin operating margin increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business whose margins had declined in recent periods slightly offset by restructuring expenses in the third quarter of 2012 operating margin increased in 2011 as compared to the prior year period also due to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business part way through the year the 2011 operating margins were also impacted by increased investments in new product development and increased sales force particularly in brazil prior to the deconsolidation of the business

 

workforce solutions 

 

  

verification services revenue increased 34 in 2012 compared to 2011 due to 36 growth in mortgagerelated verification revenue resulting from the strong level of mortgage refinancing activity during 2012 18 growth in nonmortgage verification revenue and the benefit of our third quarter 2011 acquisition of datavision resources as we anniversary the datavision resources acquisition and begin comparing future results to 2012 when mortgage refinancing activity was strong growth rates in 2013 will likely be lower than those in 2012

 

revenue increased in 2011 compared to the prior year period as high single digit percentage revenue growth in verifications provided to nonmortgage customers and the benefit of our third quarter 2011 acquisition of datavision resources were partially offset by high single digit declines in verification revenue from mortgage customers due to reduced mortgage activity 

 

employer services revenue decreased 3 in 2012 as compared to 2011 revenue declined in our tax management services business due to lower overall claims activity in our unemployment cost management business and beginning in the third quarter the delay in the renewal of the federal work opportunity tax credit program which was renewed on december 31 2012 revenue also declined in our talent management services business due to decreased government hiring activity these declines were partially offset by growth achieved in our transactionbased complementary services

cash provided by operating activities for 2012 increased by 876 million over the prior year cash provided from net income excluding the impact of the 2012 pension settlement and the 2011 impact of divestitures increased 515 million the remaining increase in cash from operations was driven primarily by changes in net working capital and other balance sheet changes most notably a 520 million reduction in cash used in current liabilities reflecting in part an increase in accrued salaries and incentives partially offset by a change in accrued taxes including certain items related to the merger of our business in brazil into bvs the increase was also driven by 40 million of pension contributions in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a 301 million reduction in cash related to deferred income taxes and a 249 million use of cash related to increased prepaid assets and other current assets

 

cash provided by operating activities for 2011 increased by 561 million over the prior year cash provided from net income adjusted for the impact of divestitures increased by 203 million the remaining increase in cash from operations was primarily driven by changes in net working capital and other balance sheet changes most notably from a 100 million decrease in pension contributions in 2011 and other lesser changes in liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to revenue growth

 





 

fund transfer limitations the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends we currently hold 1019 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries

 

investing activities 

 

  

our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance the licensing of software applications and investing in system reliability security and disaster recovery enhancements

 

capital expenditures in 2012 were lower than 2011 primarily due to the purchase of a building in our workforce solutions segment during the first quarter of 2011

 

capital expenditures in 2011 were lower than 2010 primarily due to the purchase of our headquarters building in atlanta georgia during the first quarter of 2010 for cash consideration of 290 million partially offset by an increase in investments in new products and technology infrastructure in 2011

 





 

acquisitions divestitures and investments

on april 23 2010 we sold our appro product line for approximately 72 million on july 1 2010 we sold the assets of our direct marketing services division “dms” for approximately 117 million both of these were previously reported in our us consumer information solutions segment we have presented the appro and dms operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented the discontinued operations are further described in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report

 

for additional information about our acquisitions see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report

 

financing activities 

 

  

credit facility availability our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which we refer to as the senior credit facility permits us to borrow up to 7500 million through december 2017 the senior credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes

 

our 7500 million cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our senior credit facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility

 

we had a 364day revolving credit agreement with a canadian bank our canadian credit facility which permitted us to borrow up to c100 million denominated in canadian dollars the canadian credit facility was scheduled to terminate in june 2011 we cancelled this agreement at the end of the first quarter 2011 and there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement at the time of cancellation

 

at december 31 2012 there were no borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility and 2650 million outstanding under our cp program at december 31 2012 a total of 4836 million was available under our senior credit facility

 

at december 31 2012 approximately 68 of our debt was fixed rate and 32 was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consisting of our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates generally bearing interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor and of our issued commercial paper which bears shortterm interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2012 interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 04 to 21

 

borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent activity under our cp program as well as activity under our canadian shortterm revolving credit agreement net repayments borrowings under longterm revolving credit facilities relates to activity on our senior credit facility we primarily borrow under our cp program when available

 





 

the increase in net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of 2650 million of cp notes as of december 31 2012 that was used to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services the change in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2011 primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of cp notes at december 31 2011 as compared to a net repayment of 1340 million of cp notes during 2010 as we decreased our use of cp to fund our capital needs

 

on december 17 2012 we received proceeds of 4992 million from the issuance of tenyear senior notes with a stated interest rate of 330 in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on december 15 and june 15 of each year we used the net proceeds of the sale of the notes to finance the acquisition of csc credit services in december 2012

 

debt covenants our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limit the amount of subsidiary debt our leverage ratio was 208 at december 31 2012 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants

 

we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt however our senior notes discussed above contain change in control provisions if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest

 

credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency

 

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2012 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2011 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

equity transactions 

 

  

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows

 

  

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2012 the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table

 

  

 

 

  

  





 

  

  

  





 

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities

 

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 884 million and 653 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company

 

letters of credit and guarantees 

 

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2012 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2012

 

benefit plans 

 

we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 25 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan in 2011

 

at december 31 2012 the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 we did not make any contributions to the usrip during the year ended december 31 2011 we made contributions of 400 million to the usrip we also contributed 37 million and 26 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities

 

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap

 

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report

 

seasonality 

 

we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our north america commercial business and the consumer financial marketing services business line within uscis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest

 





 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability

 

a portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report

 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions

 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes

 

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met

 





 

the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract

 

we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract

 

many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract

 

we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance

 

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction

 

deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies

 

judgments and uncertainties — each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services

 

in addition the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported

 





 

effects if actual results differ from assumptions — we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have ten reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes part of online consumer information solutions mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services identity management part of online consumer information solutions europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services tax management services part of employer services and talent management services part of employer services

 

the goodwill balance at december 31 2012 for our ten reporting units was as follows

 

  

 

in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update intangibles – goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a “qualitative” assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we performed the qualitative assessment for our consumer information solutions latin america europe canada consumer north america personal solutions and north america commercial solutions reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units

 

judgments and uncertainties — in determining the fair value of our reporting units for which we performed a quantitative test we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value

 

 





 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our “competition” discussion in item 1 of our 2012 annual report on form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information id management has benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type such as experian group limited and fair isaac corporation verification services tax management services and talent management services share a different set of benchmark companies notably adp and paychex inc as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit’s operating result with the comparable companies’ information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple

 

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value

 

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test

 

growth assumptions 

 

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion and analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally 3 to 5 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve

 

we projected revenue growth in 2013 for our reporting units in completing our 2012 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units such as demand for employment verification services and government hiring activity at the us transportation and security administration in verification services and talent management services reporting units and not based on the assumption of meaningful economic recovery growth in the talent management services reporting unit is also based on growth in the commercial sector of that business the anticipated revenue growth in all of the reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2012 longterm forecast is not dependent upon meaningful recovery of the global economy in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units

 





 

discount rate assumptions 

 

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2012 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated ranged from 9 to 12 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit

 

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

 

the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2012 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of september 30 2012 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded

 

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the company’s reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2012 ranged from approximately 17 to 125

 

the reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess of fair value over carrying value is our talent management services business which has a goodwill balance of 261 million as of september 30 2012 this reporting unit has been impacted by uncertainty in government hiring activity while no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of september 30 2012 if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecasted projected revenue growth for commercial customers does not materialize or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and would likely result in the recognition of an impairment loss additionally an increase in the discount rate due to outside factors or a decrease in the market multiples would likely result in an impairment

 

no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2012 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2012

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material

 





 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote

 

judgments and uncertainties — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material

 

income taxes 

 

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable

 

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals

 

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities

 

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2012 242 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 114 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material

 

pension and other postretirement plans 

 

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost

 

judgments and uncertainties — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is small and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material

 





 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan

 

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2012 the us pension plan investment returns of 114 exceeded the expected return of 775 for the third time in the last four years however due to lower forecasted future returns the expected return for 2013 was reduced to 75 the crip earned 88 in 2012 also exceeding its expected return of 675 for the third time in four years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for 2013 is 743 as compared to 767 which was the 2012 expected rate

 

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5459 million at december 31 2012 we do not expect our 2013 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2012 cost excluding the pension settlement and curtailment recorded in 2012 see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 767 at december 31 2012 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2013 by approximately 27 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 417 at december 31 2012 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2013 by approximately 13 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material

 

purchase accounting for acquisitions 

 

we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations  which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income

 

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations

 

on december 28 2012 we acquired csc credit services recorded total assets of 10 billion as of the acquisition date the assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that were subject to the significant estimates described above see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to this acquisition

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets

 





 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business

 

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency

 

for the year ended december 31 2012 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2012 would have increased our revenue by 494 million and our pretax operating profit by 167 million for the year ended december 31 2011 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2011 would have increased our revenue by 502 million and our pretax operating profit by 152 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2012 and 2011

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate longterm senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our 2014 fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2012 our weighted average cost of debt was 40 and weightedaverage life of debt was 86 years at december 31 2012 68 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 32 was variable rate after giving effect to the interest rate swaps on our 2014 bonds occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2012 interest expense by 54 million

 

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have material exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

on december 28 2012 we acquired certain business assets and the operations of csc credit services inc a subsidiary of computer sciences corporation as permitted by securities and exchange commission guidance the scope of our section 404 evaluation for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 does not include the internal controls over financial reporting over the acquired operations this acquisition is included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the acquisition represented approximately 10 billion of our 45 billion consolidated assets as of december 31 2012 and approximately 07 million of our 22 billion consolidated revenues for the year then ended

us data and privacy protection 

 

our us operations are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection protection and use of consumer credit and other information and imposing sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data many of these provisions also affect our customers’ use of consumer credit or other data we furnish the information underlying our north america commercial services business is less regulated than the other portions of our business

 

examples include

 

  





 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

under the doddfrank act the cfpb is the principal supervisor and enforcer of federal consumer financial protection laws with respect to nondepository institutions or “nonbanks” including without limitation any “covered person” who is a “larger participant” in a market for other consumer financial products or services

 





 

with the appointment of a cfpb director by the president on january 4 2012 the cfpb has begun to exercise authority to define unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices and to require reports and conduct examinations of these entities for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial protections laws obtaining information about the activities and compliance systems or procedures of such entities and detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services the exercise of this supervisory authority must be riskbased meaning that the cfpb will identify nonbanks for examination based on the risk they pose to consumers including consideration of the entity’s asset size transaction volume risk to consumers existing oversight by state authorities and any other factors that the cfpb determines to be relevant on february 16 2012 the cfpb issued a proposed rule designating certain consumer reporting agencies including the company as within its nonbank supervision program for “larger participants” the cfpb must issue its final rule by july 21 2012

as a “larger market participant” we are subject to cfpb supervisory examination and enforcement authority such examination may include the filing of reports reviewing materials we use to offer products and services and our compliance management systems and procedures when a nonbank is in violation of federal consumer financial laws including the cfpb’s own rules the cfpb may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce these laws and rules in these proceedings the cfpb can obtain cease and desist orders which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts as well as other kinds of affirmative relief and monetary penalties ranging from 5000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to 25000 per day for reckless violations and 1 million per day for knowing violations also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties if the cfpb or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have a material adverse effect on us

 

at this time we cannot predict the extent to which the doddfrank act or the resulting rules and regulations including those of the cfpb will impact the us economy or our business

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business faces a variety of risks and uncertainties including those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs our business financial results or results of operations may be adversely impacted these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this form 10k

 

weakness in consumer lending activity could materially adversely affect us 

 

business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available

 





 

the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi telecommunications cable and utility companies’ contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable telecommunications and utility exchange and financial institutions’ contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use where we currently have exclusive use of data the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation if we lose exclusive right to the use of data or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share

 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins

 

we also sell our information to competing firms and buy information from certain of our competitors in order to sell “tribureau” and other products most notably into the mortgage and direct to consumer markets changes in prices between competitors for this information andor changes in the design or sale of tribureau versus single bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability

 

some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins

 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process

 





 

the impact of consolidation in the financial services mortgage retail telecommunications and other markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

 

the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are not retained or chosen as a service provider we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us

 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise company customer and consumer information exposing us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer 

 

in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce and internal accounting and financial reporting systems additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information the proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers employees consumers and suppliers in data centers and on information technology networks the secure operation of these networks and systems and of the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy

 

despite our substantial investment in security measures and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operations and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business in lost sales fines or lawsuits our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention

 

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our supply and distribution chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these third party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty

 

interest rates and credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income  

 

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase our cost of capital and hurt our competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect our returns as well

 





 

our retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 

  

we have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in market interest rates decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows

 

concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perception concerning the instability of the euro the potential reintroduction of individual currencies with the eurozone or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financing 

  

as a result of the debt crisis with respect to countries in europe in particular most recently in greece italy ireland portugal and spain concerns have been raised regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency and their ability to meet future financial obligations the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries these concerns could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely should the euro be dissolved entirely the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time these potential developments or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the companys eurodenominated assets and obligations particularly in portugal spain and ireland and the future profitability or even viability of our operations in those countries in addition concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in europe and globally could have an adverse impact on global economies and capital markets generally and more specifically on the companys business in europe and the ability of the company and its customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all and on the demand for our products and services

  

we may suffer adverse financial consequences if computer sciences corporation requires us to purchase its credit reporting business at a time when the public equity or debt markets or other financing conditions are unfavorable to us 

 

in 1988 we entered into an agreement with computer sciences corporation or csc and certain of its affiliates under which csc’s credit reporting agencies utilize our computerized credit database services under this agreement csc has an option exercisable at any time to sell its credit reporting business to us the option expires in august 2013 the option exercise price will be determined by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if csc were to exercise the option at december 31 2011 the option price would have been approximately 650 million to 750 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than the estimated amount if csc were to exercise its option we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt andor equity however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit or equity market conditions general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition because we do not control the timing of the exercise if any by csc of its option we could be required to seek such financing and increase our debt levels at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable

 

the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results 

 

during 2011 we completed the acquisition of various businesses in separate transactions including datavision resources and several smaller domestic and international acquisitions and merged our brazilian business with and into boa vista servicos in exchange for an equity interest in boa vista servicos expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition

 





 

our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

 

our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to privacy and consumer data protection health and safety tax labor and environmental regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products

 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or doddfrank act was enacted in 2010 to broadly reform practices in the financial services industry title x of the doddfrank act established a new bureau of consumer financial protection or cfpb to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices the cfpb will have authority to write rules impacting the business of credit reporting companies including the company and also to supervise conduct examinations of and enforce compliance as to federal consumer financial protections laws and regulations with respect to certain “nondepository covered persons” determined by the cfpb to be “larger participants” that offer consumer financial products and services on february 16 2012 the cfpb issued a proposed rule that would include our credit reporting agency under the cfpb nonbank supervision program these laws and regulations as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our business

 

as in the united states legislation regarding the availability or use of consumer and commercial data has been and continues to be proposed from time to time in various foreign countries in which we have operations most notably in certain latin american countries these proposals have in some cases had the potential to expand the availability or uses of information and in other cases had the potential to restrict the availability or use of information we currently maintain accordingly such possible regulatory action could either increase or decrease our potential revenue and profits

 

we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to us state local and foreign governments and their respective agencies such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our business could suffer

 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all

 





  

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

 

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage

 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue

  

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

sales outside the us comprise 26 of our net operating revenue and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are increasingly located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions trade protection measures data privacy and consumer protection regulations difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and geopolitical instability including terrorism and war

 

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results

 

additionally we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and anticompetition regulations violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer products in one or more countries and could adversely affect our brand our ability to attract and retain employees our international operations our business and operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations will not violate our policies

 





  

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of certain legacy computer systems data security experts and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees

 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially affect us 

 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims including putative class action claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially affect our financial condition and operating results

  

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

 

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws

  

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

 

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment rates and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

equifax certain of its subsidiaries and other persons have been named as parties in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in connection with the operation of equifax’s businesses in most cases plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief these actions include the following

 

california bankruptcy litigation in consolidated actions filed in the us district court for the central district of california captioned terri n white et al v equifax information services llc jose hernandez v equifax information services llc kathryn l pike v equifax information services llc and jose l acosta jr et al v trans union llc et al  plaintiffs asserted that equifax violated federal and state law the fcra the california credit reporting act and the california unfair competition law by failing to follow reasonable procedures to determine whether credit accounts are discharged in bankruptcy including the method for updating the status of an account following a bankruptcy discharge on august 20 2008 the district court approved a settlement agreement and release providing for certain changes in the procedures used by defendants to record discharges in bankruptcy on consumer credit files that settlement resolved claims for injunctive relief but not plaintiffs’ claims for damages on may 7 2009 the district court issued an order preliminarily approving an agreement to settle remaining class claims the district court subsequently deferred final approval of the settlement and required the settling parties to send a supplemental notice to those class members who filed a claim and objected to the settlement or opted out with the cost for the renotice to be deducted from the plaintiffs’ counsel fee award mailing of the supplemental notice was completed on february 15 2011 the deadline for this group of settling plaintiffs to provide additional documentation to support their damage claims or to optout of the settlement was march 31 2011 on july 15 2011 following another approval hearing the district court approved the settlement several objecting plaintiffs subsequently filed notices of appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit

  

other equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have strong defenses to and where appropriate will vigorously contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief however we do not believe that these litigation matters will be individually material to our financial condition or results of operations we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process

operational and financial highlights 

 

  

  

  

business environment company outlook and strategy 

 

consumer and small business lending activity is one of the key drivers of demand for our services lending activity is now growing at a moderate rate in most loan categories and markets around the world but lenders continue to demonstrate caution in loan decisions due to continuing concerns about consumer and small business credit quality and about home values mortgage lending activity which is an important lending category for our company is cyclical based on fluctuations in both home sales and refinancing activity and mortgage activity is currently below long term average activity levels in part due to reduced home values in addition new financial regulations are increasing the compliance requirements for many of our customers and introduce new challenges as well as opportunities in the marketing of our product and service offerings to our customers real time decisionmaking for many of our customers has become more complex and reliant on quality data assets with broad market coverage our proprietary technology is efficient and sufficiently flexible to adapt to a broad array of decisioning applications by linking data assets we are able to develop high value solutions that improve the effectiveness of our customers’ decisionmaking activities in an effort to respond to these market conditions we have focused on the following activities

results of operations — 

twelve months ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

consolidated financial results 

 

operating revenue 

 

  

revenue from continuing operations increased by 5 in 2011 compared to 2010 the deconsolidation of our brazilian business which resulted from the merger of our business into bvs during the second quarter of 2011 negatively impacted revenue by 487 million compared to the prior year while all other revenue increased by 8 compared to 2010 primarily driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives across each of our businesses the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates in locations other than brazil did not have a material impact on revenue

 

revenue from continuing operations increased by 8 in 2010 compared to 2009 the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 241 million or 14 in 2010 compared to the prior year period revenue grew over the prior year in each of our operating segments primarily driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives as well as growth contributed by 2009 acquisitions in uscis and talx workforce solutions

 





 

operating expenses 

 

  

cost of services the slight increase in cost of services from continuing operations when compared to 2010 was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and benefits expense and contract services expenses of 311 million and by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by 72 million largely offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business

 

the increase in cost of services from continuing operations in 2010 when compared to 2009 was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and incentive expense of 63 million the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by 114 million and the impact of our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of ixi corporation and rapid reporting verification company

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expense from continuing operations increased 474 million compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased salary and incentive expense of 333 million higher advertising expenses of 91 million and higher severance costs offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our selling general and administrative expense by 52 million in 2011

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses from continuing operations of 372 million in 2010 when compared to 2009 was due to changes in foreign exchange rates which increased 2010 expense by 52 million and increased salary incentive and benefits expenses of 323 million offset by 248 million in restructuring charges that were incurred during 2009 that did not recur in 2010 the remaining increase was primarily due to the impact of the inclusion of businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to 66 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to our fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of anakam and our 2011 acquisitions partially offset by the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of talx in 2007 which fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our brazilian business

 

depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations in 2010 increased 170 million as compared to 2009 primarily due to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions which contributed 90 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense as well as the effect of recent investments in new products and technology infrastructure

 





 

operating income and operating margin 

 

  

operating income from continuing operations for 2011 increased faster than revenue due to better operating leverage from revenue growth and business mix as well as the deconsolidation of brazil which reduced reported revenue but which had little impact on operating profit because it had been operating near breakeven these factors resulted in operating margin improvement of 90 basis points to 240 compared to 2010

 

the increase in operating income from continuing operations and operating margin for 2010 as compared to 2009 is primarily attributed to the 8 increase in revenue and 248 million of restructuring charges in 2009 that did not recur in 2010

 

other expense net 

 

  

nm  not meaningful

 

interest expense decreased slightly in 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010 due to lower average debt balances outstanding for 2011 as compared to 2010 our consolidated debt balance has increased at december 31 2011 as a result of additional borrowings in the form of commercial paper on which interest rates and accordingly interest expense are currently very low the increase in the average cost of debt for 2011 is due to less low rate commercial paper outstanding on average year to date which caused the average cost of debt to increase as compared to the prior year period

 

interest expense decreased slightly for 2010 when compared to 2009 as a decrease in our average debt balance from 118 billion to 107 billion more than offset an increase in the average interest rate on our total debt from 48 in 2009 to 52 in 2010 the increase in our average interest rate paid was caused by a reduction in short term floating rate commercial paper while longer term fixed rate debt outstanding remained essentially unchanged

 

other expense income net from continuing operations for 2011 increased 90 million as compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to the merger of our brazilian business during the second quarter of 2011 on may 31 2011 we completed the merger of our brazilian business with bvs which was accounted for as a sale and was deconsolidated in exchange for a 15 equity interest in bvs we recorded a 103 million pretax loss on the brazilian transaction in other expense income net

 

other expense income net for 2010 as compared to 2009 declined as 2009 included a 22 million marktomarket adjustment on certain insurance policies a 11 million gain on our repurchase of 75 million principal amount of our tenyear senior notes due 2017 and a 13 million gain related to a litigation settlement

 





 

income taxes 

 

  

our effective rate was 412 for 2011 up from 351 for the same period in 2010 the 2011 rate was higher primarily due to the impact of the brazilian transaction which increased our effective rate by 52 in addition the 2010 rate benefited from certain state benefits that did not recur in 2011 this is partially offset by a cumulative income tax benefit resulting from the recognition of an income tax deduction related to several prior years we expect our effective tax rate in 2012 to be in the range of 36 to 38

 

our effective tax rate was 351 for 2010 up from 322 for the same period in 2009 the 2010 rate was higher due primarily to the prior year recognition of a 73 million income tax benefit related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits beyond 2009 more favorable discrete items in 2009 related to foreign and state taxes and a 2009 investment loss in subsidiary partially offset by a permanent federal deduction realized in 2010

 

net income 

 

  

consolidated income from continuing operations decreased by 31 million or 1 in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to the 278 million loss recorded on the brazilian transaction reflected in other expense and income tax expense partially offset by operating income growth of 410 million due to revenue growth net of associated income taxes consolidated income attributable to equifax decreased 338 million in 2011 in addition to improved operating results and the loss on the brazilian transaction described above 2010 consolidated income from continuing operations included transaction gains from discontinued operations of 272 million which did not recur in 2011

 

the increase in net income attributable to equifax for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increased income from discontinued operations driven by a 149 million gain net of tax on the sale of dms recorded in the third quarter of 2010 and a 123 million gain net of tax on the sale of the appro product line recorded in the second quarter of 2010 net income attributed to equifax for 2010 also benefited from higher operating income which grew generally in line with higher revenue

us consumer information solutions revenue increased 7 in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of growth across all of our uscis business lines the increase in revenue for 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to growth in mortgage solutions along with growth due to our acquisition of ixi corporation in the fourth quarter of 2009 partially offset by a small decline in online credit reporting revenue

 

ocis the increase in revenue for 2011 as compared to 2010 was driven by increased market volume particularly in the credit card and auto markets new customer wins new service introductions and select pricing actions in subscription and wholesale arrangements an 11 increase in core credit decision transaction volumes was partially offset by lower average price per transaction for our transaction based revenue revenue for 2010 as compared to 2009 declined primarily due to a reduction of online credit decision transaction volume of 5 caused by weakness in the us consumer credit markets while pricing remained relatively flat year over year

 

mortgage solutions revenue has increased in 2011 primarily due to increased sales of settlement services as a result of increased market share from existing customers partially offset by the declines in core mortgage reporting services due to lower refinancing activity as compared to the comparable periods of 2010 revenue for 2010 increased as compared to the prior year due to favorable longterm interest rates that resulted in higher consumer refinancing activity and increased home sales activity attributable to us government incentives for housing purchases which expired on may 31 2010

 

consumer financial marketing services 2011 revenue increased as compared to 2010 due to continued growth in creditbased prescreen and portfolio management revenue as well as strong market penetration of wealthbased consumer information services the increase in revenue in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to our acquisition of ixi corporation during the fourth quarter of 2009

 

us consumer information solutions operating margin in 2011 improved margins in online credit services and cfms resulting from solid revenue growth were offset by lower margins in mortgage solutions due to less favorable product mix and by expense investment and increased acquisitionrelated amortization associated with our fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of anakam

 

operating margin remained relatively consistent in 2010 as compared to 2009 the margin impact of amortization expense associated with the ixi acquisition was offset by expense leveraging resulting from revenue growth and expense reductions due to certain process streamlining activities

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures interest payments potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments for the foreseeable future in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the senior credit facility as described below during the first quarter we extended the maturity date of our senior credit facility from july 2011 to february 2015 and reduced the borrowing limits from 8500 million to 5000 million at december 31 2011 4686 million was available to borrow under our senior credit facility our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities for 2011 increased by 561 million over the prior year cash provided from net income adjusted for the impact of divestitures increased by 203 million the remaining increase in cash from operations was primarily driven by changes in net working capital and other balance sheet changes most notably from a 100 million decrease in pension contributions in 2011 and other lesser changes in liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to revenue growth

 

the decrease in operating cash flow for 2010 was primarily driven by 350 million of additional pension contributions a 164 million net impact on use of funds as accounts receivable which had been reduced in 2009 grew in 2010 as revenue grew and 420 million in taxes paid on the sale of dms and the appro product line these and other lesser changes in assets and liabilities more than offset increased net income and the contribution from higher depreciation and amortization

at december 31 2011 approximately 68 of our debt was fixed rate and 32 was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consisting of our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2011 interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 048 to 25

 

borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent activity under our cp program as well as activity under our canadian shortterm revolving credit agreement net repayments borrowings under longterm revolving credit facilities relates to activity on our senior credit facility we primarily borrow under our cp program when available

 





 

the increase in net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of cp notes at december 31 2011 as compared to a net repayment of 1340 million of cp notes during 2010 as we decreased our use of cp to fund our capital needs the change in net shortterm repayments borrowings in 2010 primarily reflects the net repayment of 1340 million of cp notes since december 31 2009

 

the decrease in net repayments under longterm revolving credit facilities represents the 2010 repayment of borrowings outstanding at december 31 2009 under our senior credit facility the change in net repayments for 2010 under longterm revolving credit facilities represents the 2009 repayment of borrowings outstanding at december 31 2008 under our senior credit facility as we decreased our use of cp to fund our capital needs in 2009 and 2010 the 2009 repayment of these borrowing drove the increase in net repayments borrowings for 2009 in 2009 we purchased 75 million principal amount of our outstanding tenyear senior notes due 2017 for 63 million and 250 million principal amount of our outstanding debentures due 2028 for 251 million

 

on november 4 2009 we issued 2750 million principal amount of 445 fiveyear senior notes in an underwritten public offering we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to repay amounts outstanding under our cp program a portion of which was used to finance our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions in conjunction with our 2009 sale of fiveyear senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the debt’s fixed interest rate to a variable rate

 

debt covenants our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limit the amount of subsidiary debt our leverage ratio was 161 at december 31 2011 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants

 

we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt however our senior notes discussed above contain change in control provisions if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest

 

credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency

 

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2011 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2010 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

equity transactions 

 

  

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 were as follows

 

  

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2011 the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table

 

  

  

  

  





 

  

  

  

a potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to computer sciences corporation or csc if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to august 2013 the option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if the option had been exercised at december 31 2011 the price would have been in the range of approximately 650 million to 750 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business based on limited information available to us current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate our agreement with csc which expires on july 31 2018 also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of csc while the agreement is in effect if csc were to exercise its option or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt andor equity financing however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the state of the equity markets general economic conditions our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition

 





 

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities

 

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with costs of 653 million and 479 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company

 

letters of credit and guarantees 

 

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2011 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2011

 

benefit plans 

 

prior to december 31 2009 we had one noncontributory qualified retirement plan covering most us salaried employees the equifax inc pension plan or eipp a qualified retirement plan that covered us salaried employees the us retirement income plan or usrip who terminated or retired before january 1 2005 and a defined benefit plan for most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip on december 31 2009 the plan assets and obligations of the eipp were merged with the usrip the usrip remained as the sole us qualified retirement plan

 

at december 31 2011 the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we made contributions of 400 million and 500 million respectively to the usrip we also contributed 26 and 16 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities

 

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap

 

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report

 

seasonality 

 

we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the talx workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our north america commercial business and the consumer financial marketing services business line within uscis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest

 





 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability

 

a significant portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report

 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions

 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes

 

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met

 





 

the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our talx workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract

 

we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract

 

many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract

 

we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance

 

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction

 

deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies

 

judgments and uncertainties — each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectability and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services

 

in addition the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported

 





 

effects if actual results differ from assumptions — we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have ten reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes part of online consumer information solutions mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services identity management part of online consumer information solutions europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services tax management services part of employer services and talent management services part of employer services

 

the goodwill balance at december 31 2011 for our ten reporting units was as follows

 

  

as permitted by applicable accounting rules the fair values of consumer information solutions latin america europe canada consumer north america personal solutions and north america commercial solutions were not calculated at september 30 2011 as a the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since their most recent fair value determination b the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin and c based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote

 

judgments and uncertainties — in determining the fair value of our reporting units we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value

 





 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our “competition” discussion in item 1 of our 2011 annual report on form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information id management has benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type such as experian group limited and the dun  bradstreet corporation verification services tax management services and talent management services share a different set of benchmark companies notably adp and paychex inc as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit’s operating result with the comparable companies’ information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple

 

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value

 

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test

 

growth assumptions 

 

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion  analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally 3 to 5 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve

 

as a result of the slow rate of economic recovery we projected only modest revenue growth in 2012 for our reporting units in completing our 2011 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units such as continued demand for employment verification services and government hiring activity at the us transportation and security administration in the verification services and talent management services reporting units the anticipated revenue growth however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2011 longterm forecast is not dependent upon strong recovery of the global economy in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units

 





 

discount rate assumptions 

 

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2011 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated ranged from 9 to 10 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit

 

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

 

the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2011 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of september 30 2011 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded

 

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the company’s reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2011 ranged from approximately 19 to 86

 

the reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess of fair value over carrying value is our talent management services business which has a goodwill balance of 261 million as of september 30 2011 this reporting unit has been impacted by uncertainty in government hiring activity while no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of september 30 2011 if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecast or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and may possibly result in the recognition of an impairment loss

 

no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2011 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2011

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material

 





 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote

 

judgments and uncertainties  — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material

 

income taxes 

 

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable

 

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals

 

judgments and uncertainties — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities

 

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2011 251 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 46 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months

 





 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material

 

pension and other postretirement plans 

 

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates salary growth expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost

 

judgments and uncertainties — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is small and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material

 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan

 

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in setting the longterm expected rate of return management considers capital markets’ future expectations and the asset mix of the plan investments prior to 2008 the us pension plan compound annual investment returns were 109 130 and 75 over three five and ten years respectively the returns exceeded the sp 500 returns for similar periods of time primarily due to an asset allocation strategy where large allocations to alternative asset classes hedge fund of funds private equity real estate and real assets provided consistently higher returns with a low correlation to equity market returns these returns historically demonstrate a longterm record of producing returns at or above the expected rate of return however the dramatic adverse market conditions in 2008 skewed the traditional measures of longterm performance such as the tenyear average return the severity of the 2008 losses approximately negative 20 makes the historical tenyear average return a less accurate predictor of future return expectations our weightedaverage expected rate of return for 2012 is 773 which is the same as the 2011 and 2010 expected rate

 

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 6257 million at december 31 2011 we do not expect our 2012 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2011 cost see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 773 at december 31 2011 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2012 by approximately 31 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 460 at december 31 2011 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2012 by approximately 14 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material

 





 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the argentine peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business

 

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded on our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency

 

for the year ended december 31 2011 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2011 would have increased our revenue by 502 million and our pretax operating profit by 152 million for the year ended december 31 2010 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2010 would have increased our revenue by 496 million and our pretax operating profit by 137 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2011 and 2010

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate longterm senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our 2014 fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2011 our weighted average cost of debt was 53 and weightedaverage life of debt was 108 years at december 31 2011 68 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 32 was variable rate after giving effect to the interest rate swaps on our 2014 bonds occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2011 interest expense by 28 million

 

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have material exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home and equity loans and other consumer loans and to manage their existing credit relationships bank and other lenders’ willingness to extend credit is adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth high or rising rates of unemployment and interest declines in income home prices or investment values lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for our products and services and consequently our revenue as consumers may continue to postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available 

 

  

  

the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public record sources this includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the us and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements such as employers ’ contribution of employment and income data to the work number financial institutions’ contribution of individual financial data to ixi and financial institutions’ contribution of small business borrowing information to the small business financial exchange our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenue net income and earnings per share 

 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margins 

 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services the size of our competitors varies across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as is the case in brazil and the uk markets where we face a larger competitor as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins 

 

some of our competitors may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technological superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms historically certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales information technology and development and other costs if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand we could experience further reductions in our operating margins 

 

if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 

 

we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards in addition certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical without the timely introduction of new products services and enhancements our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors including our ability to properly identify customer needs innovate and develop new technologies services and applications successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings price our products competitively anticipate our competitors’ development of new products services or technological innovations and control product quality in our product development process 

 

  

  

the impact of consolidation in the financial services mortgage retail telecommunications and other markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business 

 

the financial services mortgage retail and telecommunications industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation continuation of the consolidation trends in these and other industries could result in lower average prices for the larger combined entities lower combined purchases of our services than were purchased cumulatively by separate entities prior to consolidation or existing competitors increasing their market share in newly consolidated entities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are not retained or chosen as a service provider we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

 

if we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted 

 

we are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information if we are unable to prevent such breaches our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information 

 

many of our products are accessed through the internet including our consumer and commercial information services security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services via the internet may affect us or our industry and could be detrimental to our reputation business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products and services 

 

dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our supply and distribution chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively 

 

as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to reduce operating costs we have outsourced various components of our application development information technology operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing although we have implemented service level agreements and have established monitoring controls if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer any failure to perform on the part of these third party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue unexecuted efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our stock price much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 

 

if we experience system failures the delivery of our products and services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

 

our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data centers some of these systems have been outsourced to thirdparty providers any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers and large expenses to repair or replace the facility our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from power disruption fire flood telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters the steps we have taken and are taking to prevent a system failure including backup disaster recovery systems may not be effective our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur also our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 

 

  

  

interest rates and credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of capital and net income  

 

rising interest rates credit market dislocations and decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can affect the availability and cost of our funding credit rating downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can increase our cost of capital and hurt our competitive position guidance from rating agencies as to acceptable leverage can affect our returns as well 

 

we may suffer adverse financial consequences if computer sciences corporation requires us to purchase its credit reporting business at a time when the public equity or debt markets or other financing conditions are unfavorable to us 

 

in 1988 we entered into an agreement with computer sciences corporation or csc and certain of its affiliates under which csc’s credit reporting agencies utilize our computerized credit database services under this agreement csc has an option exercisable at any time to sell its credit reporting business to us the option expires in august 2013 the option exercise price will be determined by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if csc were to exercise the option at december 31 2010 the option price would have been approximately 625 million to 700 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than the estimated amount if csc were to exercise its option we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt andor equity however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit or equity market conditions general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition because we do not control the timing of the exercise if any by csc of its option we could be required to seek such financing and increase our debt levels at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable 

 

the acquisition integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the desired financial or operating results 

during 2010 we completed the acquisition of various businesses in separate transactions including anakam inc and several international acquisitions and divested our appro loan origination software and direct marketing services businesses to align with our strategic focus expected benefits synergies and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products services technologies and personnel into our operations these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition also we may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition 

 

our customers and we are subject to various current governmental regulations and could be affected by new laws or regulations compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 

 

our businesses are subject to various significant international federal state and local regulations including but not limited to privacy and consumer data protection health and safety tax labor and environmental regulations these regulations are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations in addition because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 

 

enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the rules and regulations that may be issued by us regulators implementing such legislation as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in impose additional costs on us result in significant loss of revenue impact the value of assets we hold or otherwise significantly adversely affect our businesses 

  

  

we also have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities including through the performance assessment network subsidiary of our talx business and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts for example many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts or administrative penalties 

 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 

 

from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all 

 

third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

 

our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents copyrights database rights trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our proprietary rights the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

 

we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons in addition competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue 

 

economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

sales outside the us make up approximately 27 of our net operating revenue and as a result our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent an increasing portion of our total revenue in addition many of our employees suppliers job functions and facilities are increasingly located outside the us accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including changes in specific country or region political economic or other conditions trade protection measures data privacy and consumer protection regulations difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations differing labor intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions prevent us from entering certain markets increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a taxefficient manner and geopolitical instability including terrorism and war 

 

  

  

we earn revenue pay expenses own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar including among others the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the chilean peso and the euro because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenue income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other major currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies because of the geographic diversity of our operations weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place accordingly fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the strengthening of the us dollar against major currencies may materially affect our consolidated financial results 

 

in many foreign countries particularly those with developing economies it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the newly passed but not yet implemented uk bribery act although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation 

 

our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 

 

our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key development sales marketing executive and administrative personnel additionally increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations that require specialized skills such as maintenance of legacy computer systems and analytical modelers if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel we will not be able to maintain or expand our business we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate however there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees 

 

unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially affect us 

 

we are subject to legal proceedings and claims including putative class action claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially affect our financial condition and operating results 

 

changes in income tax laws can significantly impact our net income 

federal and state governments in the us as well as a number of other governments around the world are currently facing significant fiscal pressures and have considered or may consider changes to their tax laws for revenue raising or economic competiveness reasons changes to tax laws can have immediate impacts either favorable or unfavorable on our results of operations and cash flows and may impact our competitive position versus certain competitors who are domiciled in other jurisdictions and subject to different tax laws 

we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 

in addition to the specific factors discussed above we are subject to risks that are inherent to doing business these include growth rates general economic and political conditions customer satisfaction with the quality of our services costs of obtaining insurance changes in unemployment and other events that can impact revenue and the cost of doing business

our other properties are geographically distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide we consider these properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet our current operating requirements and most of the space is being utilized we ordinarily lease office space for conducting our business and are obligated under approximately 110 leases and other rental arrangements for our field locations we owned five office buildings at december 31 2010 including our executive offices mentioned above two buildings which house our atlanta georgia data center as well as buildings utilized by our latin america operations located in sao paulo brazil and santiago chile we also own 235 acres adjacent to the atlanta georgia data center

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

equifax certain of its subsidiaries and other persons have been named as parties in various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in connection with the operation of equifax’s businesses in most cases plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief these actions include the following 

 

california bankruptcy litigation in consolidated actions filed in the us district court for the central district of california captioned terri n white et al v equifax information services llc jose hernandez v equifax information services llc kathryn l pike v equifax information services llc and jose l acosta jr et al v trans union llc et al plaintiffs asserted that equifax violated federal and state law the fcra the california credit reporting act and the california unfair competition law by failing to follow reasonable procedures to determine whether credit accounts are discharged in bankruptcy including the method for updating the status of an account following a bankruptcy discharge on august 20 2008 the district court approved a settlement agreement and release providing for certain changes in the procedures used by defendants to record discharges in bankruptcy on consumer credit files that settlement resolved claims for injunctive relief but not plaintiffs’ claims for damages on may 7 2009 the district court issued an order preliminarily approving an agreement to settle remaining class claims certain plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the preliminary approval order which motion was denied by the district court on june 9 2009 following a hearing on may 20 2010 the district court deferred final approval of the settlement and issued an order requiring the settling parties to send a supplemental notice to all class members on december 14 2010 the district court granted the settling plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration and ruled that the defendants will only have to renotice those class members who filed a claim and objected to the settlement or opted out with the cost for the renotice to be deducted from the plaintiffs’ counsel fee award 

 

other equifax has been named as a defendant in various other legal actions including administrative claims class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business some of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we believe we have strong defenses to and where appropriate will vigorously contest many of these matters given the number of these matters some are likely to result in adverse judgments penalties injunctions fines or other relief however we do not believe that these litigation matters will be individually material to our financial condition or results of operations we may explore potential settlements before a case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty and risks inherent in the litigation process

operational and financial highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business environment company outlook and strategy 

 

consumer and small business lending activity which is one of the drivers of demand for our services has stabilized in most markets around the world but in most cases is not yet showing significant growth we expect growth in consumer lending to continue to lag the general economic recovery particularly in the more mature markets in addition new financial regulations are increasing the compliance requirements for many of our customers introducing new challenges and opportunities in the marketing of our product and service offerings to financial institutions in an effort to respond to these challenges we have focused on the following initiatives and activities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for 2011 the operating environment will continue to create challenges for the marketing and growth of our traditional products and services but will also create new opportunities for our more recently developed products which leverage our diverse data assets analytical capabilities and technology to improve customers decisioning capabilities and risk management activities in 2011 we expect improvements in the credit economy to be modest and therefore not contribute measurably to organic growth however we do expect to derive organic growth through our new product offerings and from the momentum we achieved as a result of our performance in 2010 

 

results of operations — 

twelve months ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

consolidated financial results 

 

operating revenue 

 

 

 

revenue from continuing operations increased by 8 compared to 2009 the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 241 million or 14 in 2010 compared to the prior year period revenue grew over the prior year in each of our operating segments primarily driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives as well as growth contributed by 2009 acquisitions in uscis and talx for additional information about revenue fluctuations and operating income by segment see “segment financial results” below 

 

the decrease in revenue from continuing operations for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to continued global economic weakness which significantly impacted demand for our us consumer information solutions international and north america personal solutions business units when compared to 2008 as well as the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange rates foreign currency negatively impacted 2009 revenue by 489 million or 3 this decrease was partially offset by strength in our talx segment and mortgage solutions business within us consumer information solutions 

 

 

 

  

operating expenses 

 

 

 

cost of services the increase in cost of services from continuing operations when compared to 2009 was due primarily to the impact of increased salary and incentives expense of 63 million the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which increased our cost of services by 114 million and the impact of our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of ixi corporation and rapid reporting verification company 

 

the decrease in cost of services from continuing operations for 2009 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation the impact of foreign currency translation decreased our cost of services by 192 million during 2009 the remaining decrease was due to lower technology outsourcing costs resulting from a renegotiated contract with a large service provider and lower personnel costs resulting from our third quarter 2008 and 2009 headcount reductions this decrease was partially offset by increased production costs related to growth in demand for our settlement services products within our mortgage solutions business and increased postretirement employee benefit costs we reclassified 132 million of selling general and administrative expense during the twelve months ended december 31 2008 to cost of services to conform to the current period presentation 

 

selling general and administrative expenses the increase in selling general and administrative expenses from continuing operations of 372 million in 2010 when compared to 2009 was due to changes in foreign exchange rates which increased 2010 expense by 52 million and increased salary incentive and benefits expenses of 323 million offset by 248 million in restructuring charges that were incurred during 2009 that did not recur in 2010 the remaining increase was primarily due to the impact of the inclusion of businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

selling general and administrative expenses from continuing operations for 2009 decreased 204 million when compared to 2008 of this decline 127 million resulted from foreign currency translation the remaining decrease was primarily due to reduced legal expenses lower technology and occupancy costs and reduced personnel and incentive costs due to the 2008 and 2009 headcount reductions partially offset by a 104 million increase in restructuring charges in 2009 increased advertising and insurance costs and higher postretirement employee benefits cost 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations in 2010 increased 170 million as compared to 2009 primarily due to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions which contributed 90 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense as well as the effect of recent investments in new products and technology infrastructure 

 

depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations increased 30 million in 2009 over 2008 excluding the positive foreign currency translation impact of 26 million depreciation and amortization expense increased 56 million over the prior year the increase is primarily due to our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of ixi corporation and rapid reporting verification company which contributed 18 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense and the inclusion of a full year of depreciation and amortization expense for our 2008 acquisitions partially offset by the absence of a 24 million software writedown charge recognized in 2008 

 

for additional information about our restructuring charges see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

 

 

 

 

operating income and operating margin 

 

 

 

the increase in operating income from continuing operations and operating margin for 2010 as compared to 2009 is primarily attributed to the 8 increase in revenue and 248 million of restructuring charges in 2009 that did not recur in 2010 

 

the decline in operating margin for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to lower operating income in our uscis international and north america personal solutions segments and 80 million of additional restructuring charges in 2009 partially offset by growth in our talx operating income the operating income declines for the aforementioned segments are attributed to reductions in revenue resulting from global economic weakness partially offset by lower operating expenses due to headcount reductions reduced incentive costs and lower technology outsourcing costs

the increase in other expense net from continuing operations for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to a decline in other income net other income net for 2009 included a 22 million marktomarket adjustment on certain insurance policies a 11 million gain on our repurchase of 75 million principal amount of our tenyear senior notes due 2017 and a 13 million gain related to a litigation settlement interest expense decreased slightly for 2010 when compared to 2009 as a decrease in our average debt balance from 118 billion to 107 billion more than offset an increase in the average interest rate on our total debt from 48 in 2009 to 52 in 2010 the increase in our average interest rate paid was caused by a reduction in short term floating rate commercial paper while longer term fixed rate debt outstanding remained essentially unchanged 

 

the decrease in other expense net for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating rate debt which drove the average cost of our total debt from 53 in 2008 to 48 in 2009 as well as a reduced level of debt outstanding during 2009 our average debt balance fell to 118 billion in 2009 from 134 billion in 2008 for additional information about our debt agreements see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report other income net for 2009 primarily includes a 22 million marktomarket adjustment on certain insurance policies a 11 million gain on our repurchase of 75 million principal amount of our tenyear senior notes due 2017 and a 13 million gain related to a litigation settlement other income net in 2008 includes a 55 million gain on our repurchase of 20 million principal amount of tenyear senior notes due 2017 

 

 

 

 

income taxes 

 

 

 

our effective tax rate was 351 for 2010 up from 322 for the same period in 2009 the 2010 rate was higher due primarily to the prior year recognition of a 73 million income tax benefit related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits beyond 2009 more favorable discrete items in 2009 related to foreign and state taxes and a 2009 investment loss in subsidiary partially offset by a permanent federal deduction realized in 2010 we expect our effective tax rate in 2011 to increase to a range of 36 to 38 

 

our effective income tax rate for 2009 was up slightly compared to 2008 the 2009 rate reflects the recognition of a 73 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits beyond 2009 additionally we recorded favorable discrete items in 2009 related to foreign and state taxes and an investment loss in a subsidiary with the fourth quarter 2009 adjustments we have recognized the benefit of foreign tax credit carryforwards that would have reduced future tax expense the 2008 rate reflects 146 million in income tax benefits that we recorded related to uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitations had expired which resulted in a lower effective income tax rate in 2008 as compared to 2009 

 

net income 

 

 

 

the increase in net income attributable to equifax for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increased income from discontinued operations driven by a 149 million gain net of tax on the sale of dms recorded in the third quarter of 2010 and a 123 million gain net of tax on the sale of the appro product line recorded in the second quarter of 2010 net income attributed to equifax for 2010 also benefited from higher operating income which grew generally in line with higher revenue 

 

the decrease in net income for 2009 as compared to 2008 was a function of lower operating income in three of our five businesses and 80 million of additional restructuring charges in 2009 partially offset by increased income from our talx and north america commercial solutions segments and lower interest expense

us consumer information solutions 

 

 

 

us consumer information solutions revenue increased 4 in 2010 as compared to 2009 as growth in mortgage solutions along with growth due to our acquisition of ixi corporation in the fourth quarter of 2009 was partially offset by a small decline in online credit reporting revenue the decrease in revenue for 2009 as compared to 2008 was mainly due to continued weakness in the us credit and retail economy offset by growth in the mortgage solutions business due to increased activity associated with our settlement services products and increased mortgage refinancing activity in 2009 and 2010 

 

ocis revenue for 2010 as compared to 2009 declined primarily due to a reduction of online credit decision transaction volume of 5 caused by weakness in the us consumer credit markets while pricing remained relatively flat year over year revenue for 2009 as compared to the prior year declined primarily due to a reduction of online credit decision transaction volume as consumer lending activity was lower than in 2008 the 18 decline in volume for 2009 from the prior year was partially offset by a 4 increase in average revenue per transaction this increase was attributable to a disproportionate decline in volume from large national accounts which are generally billed at a lower average price per transaction 

 

mortgage solutions revenue for 2010 has increased as compared to the prior year due to favorable longterm interest rates that have resulted in higher consumer refinancing activity and increased home sales activity attributable to us government incentives for housing purchases which expired on may 31 2010 the 2009 increase in revenue as compared to 2008 is due to increased activity associated with growth in demand for our settlement services products which resulted in increased revenue of 165 million over 2008 higher volumes of mortgage credit reporting related to increased refinance activity and incremental revenue from our acquisition of certain assets of a small mortgage credit reporting reseller 

 

consumer financial marketing services the increase in revenue in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to our acquisition of ixi corporation during the fourth quarter of 2009 revenue decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008 as banks and other market participants reduced prescreen marketing volumes and negotiated lower prices for portfolio management services at a time of significant uncertainty in the consumer credit market this decline was partially offset by approximately 6 million of incremental revenue from our acquisition of ixi corporation in october 2009 

 

us consumer information solutions operating margin operating margin remained relatively consistent in 2010 as compared to 2009 the margin impact of amortization expense associated with the ixi acquisition was offset by expense leveraging resulting from revenue growth and expense reductions due to certain process streamlining activities 

 

operating margin decreased for 2009 as compared to 2008 mainly due to revenue declines described above in our ocis and consumer financial marketing services businesses our operating expenses generally do not decline at the same rate as our revenue due to a high portion of costs that are fixed rather than variable in the short term the overall decline in revenue was partially offset by lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions process efficiencies and lower technology outsourcing costs the increases in revenue from our core mortgage and settlement services products also contributed to the uscis margin decline as these products have higher variable costs and lower margins than traditional online database products 

 

 

 

 

international 

 

 

 

international revenue increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to strong growth in latin america and the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates local currency fluctuations against the us dollar favorably impacted our international revenue by 218 million or 5 in local currency international revenue was up 5 in 2010 for 2009 as compared to 2008 revenue decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and secondarily due to global economic weakness affecting several of our larger international country operations local currency fluctuation against the us dollar negatively impacted our 2009 international revenue by 472 million or 9 in local currency 2009 revenue was down 4 as compared to the same period a year ago

europe the slight decrease in revenue for 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 32 million or 3 in local currency revenue increased 2 as compared to the same period in 2009 the increase was due to growth in online transactions and a higher volume of subscriptions in the uk as well as higher registries usage in spain and portugal offset by declines in some of our other product segments the decline in revenue for 2009 as compared to the prior year was partially due to the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 213 million or 12 in local currency revenue declined 9 for 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 the local currency declines were due to decreased volume in the uk caused by weakness in the uk economy affecting customer demand which was partially offset by higher volumes and new customers for our online services and new collections products in spain and portugal 

 

canada consumer the 141 million increase in revenue for 2010 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to favorable foreign currency impact of 106 million or 11 in local currency revenue increased 3 when compared to 2009 the increase in local currency was due to increased volumes for our technology and analytical services products primarily due to growth in the customer base for a new fraud mitigation product the decline in revenue for 2009 as compared to the prior year was partially due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 70 million or 6 in local currency revenue declined 4 for 2009 as compared to 2008 the decline in local currency was due to lower volumes related to our online solutions and marketing products resulting from weakness in the economy partially offset by increased volumes for our analytical and decisioning technology products

talx 

 

 

 

the work number revenue from the work number increased 509 million or 32 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to middouble digit growth from traditional employment based verification and complementary services with strong demand across each of the mortgage preemployment screening social services and collections sectors and due to the impact of our acquisition of rapid reporting verification company in the fourth quarter of 2009 revenue increased in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the increased volumes of verifications of consumer employment from government service agencies who use our services to approve benefits to consumers under certain government programs and verifications of employment and income by financial institutions who confirm consumer data for use in underwriting decisions our acquisition of rapid reporting verification company in november 2009 provided approximately 5 million of incremental revenue 

 

tax and talent management services the decrease in revenue during 2010 as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from expected declines in our tax management services business driven primarily by decreases in unemployment compensation claims activity partially offset by revenue growth in our talent management services business due to increased government hiring activity at the us transportation and security administration and other large government customers the increase in revenue during 2009 as compared to 2008 resulted from growth in our tax management services business driven primarily by increased unemployment compensation claims activity due to the high levels of unemployment in the us partially offset by declines in volume from our talent management services business during the first half of the year as demand was negatively impacted by reduced hiring activity by employers particularly governmental agencies who are key clients caused by the weakened economy and budgetary pressures 

 

talx operating margin operating margin increased 150 basis points for 2010 as compared to 2009 and 440 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to continued revenue growth while operating expenses grew at a slower rate due to the leveraging of certain fixed operational and overhead costs and certain operating process efficiencies for both periods 

 

north america personal solutions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the increase in revenue for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to increased direct to customer equifaxbranded subscription service revenue which was up 11 from 2009 driven by higher average revenue per subscriber due to new product offerings and better market segmentation the increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by lower transaction sales and lower corporate breach revenues the operating margin increase was primarily due to the revenue growth and operating efficiencies 

 

revenue declined for 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower transaction sales as a result of lower levels of new consumer credit activity and lower corporate data breach revenues these declines were partially offset by direct to consumer equifaxbranded subscription service revenue which was up 4 for 2009 as compared to the prior year driven by higher new sales and higher average revenue per subscription reflecting additional features in the equifax offering total subscription customers including direct to consumer equifaxbranded services and subscriptions related to data breach offers were 10 million at december 31 2009 the operating margin decline in 2009 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the revenue decline discussed above as well as increased advertising expenses as the company introduced a 2009 television advertising program in order to increase direct subscription sales 

 

north america commercial solutions 

 

 

 

revenue increased for 2010 as compared to 2009 107 million or 15 the favorable impact of changes in the us – canadian foreign exchange rate increased revenue by 23 million or 3 in local currency revenue increased 12 in 2010 compared to the prior year the local currency increase was primarily due to increases in us risk and marketing service revenue and revenue from our data management products online transaction volume for us commercial credit information products for 2010 increased when compared to the prior year operating margin increased for 2010 as compared to 2009 as the rapid rate in revenue growth exceeded growth in operating expenses

general corporate expense 

 

 

 

our general corporate expenses are costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction such as shared services administrative legal equity compensation costs and restructuring expenses general corporate expenses decreased for 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of 248 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2009 that did not recur in 2010 this was partially offset by increased salary benefit and incentive costs upgrades in shared corporate technology and acquisitionrelated expenses 

 

general corporate expenses decreased slightly for 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of reduced incentive costs lower legal and professional fees and reduced occupancy costs this was partially offset by 80 million of additional restructuring charges recorded during 2009 as well as increased insurance costs total 2009 restructuring charges of 248 million related primarily to headcount reductions 

 

 

 

 

liquidity and financial condition 

 

management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating investing and financing activities we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure to meet short and longterm objectives 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity we believe that funds generated from expected results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures interest payments potential pension funding contributions dividend payments and stock repurchases if any for the foreseeable future since the beginning of 2009 credit market conditions have improved and we have primarily shifted our shortterm borrowings to our commercial paper program in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate we would rely more heavily on borrowings as needed under our senior credit facility described below at december 31 2010 8483 million was available to borrow under our senior credit facility our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement 

 

on february 18 2011 we extended the maturity date and reduced the borrowing limits of our existing unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of july 24 2006 as amended the senior credit facility with a group of lenders by entering into a second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of february 18 2011 the “amended agreement” the senior credit facility had been scheduled to expire on july 24 2011 and provided 850 million of borrowing capacity the amended agreement provides for a maturity date of february 18 2015 we elected to reduce the size of the facility to 500 million in line with our liquidity needs and reflecting credit market conditions including higher upfront fees and fees for unused borrowing availability the amended agreement also provides an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitment amount to 750 million should we so choose we added certain of our subsidiaries in canada and luxembourg as coborrowers in addition to the company and our uk subsidiary to provide additional flexibility as to the place of borrowing 

 

the amended agreement revises certain other terms of the existing credit agreement including pricing to reflect current market conditions the pricing grid for the senior credit facility which is based on our applicable credit ratings at the time of any borrowing was increased based on our current credit ratings the unused facility fee as of the closing date increased from 8 to 20 basis points and the margin for base rate or libor rate loans and letters of credit as of the closing date increased from 32 to 150 basis points the amended agreement did not change the existing financial covenant which requires us to maintain on a rolling four quarter basis a maximum leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the amended agreement not to exceed 35 to 10 on february 18 2011 we correspondingly reduced the size of our commercial paper program the cp program which is supported by the senior credit facility from 850 million to 500 million 

fund transfer limitations the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends

operating activities 

 

the decrease in operating cash flow for 2010 was primarily driven by 350 million of additional pension contributions a 164 million net impact on use of funds as accounts receivable which had been reduced in 2009 grew in 2010 as revenue grew and 420 million in taxes paid on the sale of dms and the appro product line these and other lesser changes in assets and liabilities more than offset increased net income and the contribution from higher depreciation and amortization 

 

the decrease in operating cash flow for 2009 was primarily driven by 385 million of lower consolidated net income described above and 293 million of pension contributions in 2009 with no similar payments made in 2008 these items were partially offset by year to year reduction in days sales outstanding in trade receivables and increases in operating liabilities as reduced levels of accruals in 2008 did not recur 

 

fund transfer limitations the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments these restrictions do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends 

 

investing activities 

 

 

 

our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance the licensing of software applications and investing in system reliability security and disaster recovery enhancements 

 

capital expenditures in 2010 were higher than 2009 due to the purchase of our headquarters building in atlanta ga on february 27 2009 we notified the lessor of our headquarters building that we intended to exercise our purchase option in accordance with the lease terms we purchased the building for 290 million on february 26 2010 the notice of our intent to exercise our purchase option caused us to account for this lease obligation as a capital lease we recorded the building and the related obligation on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 for additional information regarding our headquarters building lease see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

 

capital expenditures in 2009 were less than 2008 due to significant data center infrastructure improvements that were substantially completed in 2008 we expect capital expenditures in 2011 to be in the range of 75 million to 95 million as we continue to invest for growth

financing activities 

 

 

 

credit facility availability our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which we refer to as the senior credit facility permitted us to borrow up to 8500 million through july 2011 the senior credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper notes or cp the senior credit facility was scheduled to expire in july 2011 as noted above on february 18 2011 we extended the maturity date to february 18 2015 and reduced the borrowing limits of the senior credit facility from 8500 million to 5000 million pursuant to the amended agreement 

 

our 8500 million cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes on february 18 2011 under the terms of the amended agreement we correspondingly reduced the size of the cp program which is supported by the senior credit facility from 850 million to 500 million 

 

in june 2010 we amended our 364day revolving credit agreement with a canadian bank our canadian credit facility to reduce the borrowing limit from c200 million to c100 million denominated in canadian dollars and extending its maturity through june 2011 borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes 

 

at december 31 2010 no amounts were outstanding under our senior credit facility cp program or canadian credit facility at december 31 2010 a total of 8583 million was available under our committed credit facilities 

 

at december 31 2010 approximately 72 of our debt was fixedrate debt and 28 was effectively variablerate debt our variablerate debt consisting of our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2010 interest rates on our variablerate debt were 21 

 

borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent activity under our cp program as well as activity under our canadian shortterm revolving credit agreement net repayments borrowings under longterm revolving credit facilities relates to activity on our senior credit facility we primarily borrow under our cp program when available 

 

 

 

 

the change in net shortterm repayments borrowings in 2010 primarily reflects the net repayment of 1340 million of cp notes since december 31 2009 net shortterm borrowings in 2009 primarily reflects the net issuance of 1320 million of cp notes offset by the repayment of 258 million under our canadian credit facility in 2009 net shortterm repayments in 2008 reflects the net repayment of 2165 million of the balance outstanding on our cp notes offset by the increase of 258 million in borrowings under our canadian credit facility 

 

the change in net repayments borrowings for 2010 under longterm revolving credit facilities represents the 2009 repayment of borrowings outstanding at december 31 2008 under our senior credit facility as we decreased our use of cp to fund our capital needs in 2009 and 2010 the 2009 repayment of these borrowing drove the increase in net repayments borrowings for 2009 in 2008 the net borrowing activity under longterm revolving credit facilities primarily represents our pay down of 2165 million of cp outstanding at december 31 2007 from cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility to lower the average cost of our debt and due to the adverse conditions in the cp market in 2009 we purchased 75 million principal amount of our outstanding tenyear senior notes due 2017 for 63 million and 250 million principal amount of our outstanding debentures due 2028 for 251 million during 2008 we purchased 200 million principal amount of the tenyear senior notes due 2017 for 143 million 

 

on november 4 2009 we issued 2750 million principal amount of 445 fiveyear senior notes in an underwritten public offering we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes to repay amounts outstanding under our cp program a portion of which was used to finance our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions in conjunction with our 2009 sale of fiveyear senior notes we entered into fiveyear interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges which convert the debt’s fixed interest rate to a variable rate 

 

debt covenants our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition our senior credit facility and canadian credit facility each require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limit the amount of subsidiary debt our leverage ratio was 171 at december 31 2010 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

 

we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt however our senior notes discussed above contain change in control provisions if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard  poor’s or sp and moody’s investors service or moody’s below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 

 

credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sp and moody’s use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sp and moody’s respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 

 

longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sp and moody’s respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade” at december 31 2010 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2009 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the market’s demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

equity transactions 

 

 

 

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2010 the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a potential significant future use of cash would be the payment to computer sciences corporation or csc if it were to exercise its option to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to 2013 the option exercise price would be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if the option had been exercised at december 31 2010 the price range would have been approximately 625 million to 700 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate our agreement with csc which expires on july 31 2018 also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of csc while the agreement is in effect if csc were to exercise its option or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt andor equity financing however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the state of the equity markets general economic conditions our credit ratings and our financial performance and condition 

 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet transactions 

 

we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities 

 

pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with costs of 479 million and 357 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized in the company’s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company 

 

letters of credit and guarantees 

 

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2010 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2010 

 

benefit plans 

 

prior to december 31 2009 we had one noncontributory qualified retirement plan covering most us salaried employees the equifax inc pension plan or eipp a qualified retirement plan that covered us salaried employees the us retirement income plan or usrip who terminated or retired before january 1 2005 and a defined benefit plan for most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip on december 31 2009 the plan assets and obligations of the eipp were merged with the usrip the usrip remained as the sole us qualified retirement plan 

 

at december 31 2010 the usrip met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements in january 2011 we made a contribution of 100 million to the usrip during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 we made contributions of 500 million to the usrip during the twelve months ended december 31 2009 we made contributions of 150 million to the eipp we also contributed 16 and 18 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the equifax employee benefits trust contributed 125 million to the eipp upon dissolution of the trust in 2009 in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities 

 

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

 

for additional information about our benefit plans see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

 

seasonality 

 

we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the work number business unit within the talx operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters 

 

 

 

 

effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

equifax’s operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the company’s expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the company’s financial position and profitability 

 

a significant portion of the company’s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our processing of transactions related to the provision of information services to our customers in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract’s subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 

 

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

 

 

 

the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual reported volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our talx operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract 

 

we have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer 

 

many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

 

we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance 

 

we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 

 

deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information services relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 

 

judgments and uncertainties — each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 

 

 

 

 

in addition the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 

 

effects if actual results differ from assumptions — we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we review goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have nine reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions the work number tax management services and talent management services 

 

the goodwill balance at december 31 2010 for our nine reporting units was as follows 

 

 

 

judgments and uncertainties  — in determining the fair value of our reporting units we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit’s business enterprise value 

 

under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are outlined in our “competition” discussion in item i of this report data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information latin america has benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type and scope such as experian group limited and the dun  bradstreet corporation the work number tax management services and talent management services share a different set of benchmark companies notably adp and paychex inc as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit’s operating result with the comparable companies’ information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple 

 

 

 

 

the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 

 

we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test 

 

growth assumptions 

 

the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our management’s discussion  analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally 3 to 5 based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product or gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 

 

as a result of the economic downturn experienced in 2008 and 2009 and the resultant decline in revenue experienced in certain of our business units in completing our 2010 impairment testing at september 30 2010 we projected only modest revenue growth in 2011 for our reporting units based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units the anticipated revenue growth is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2010 longterm forecast anticipated slow but steady recovery of the global economy in 2011 which combined with our own strategic initiatives is expected to result in moderate revenue and cash flow growth we also plan on continuing to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units 

 

 

 

 

discount rate assumptions 

 

we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company’s tax rate for the 2010 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units ranged from 10 to 16 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to the degree of maturity or predictability of a business competition or participation in less stable geographic markets such as our latin america reporting unit the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit 

 

estimated fair value and sensitivities 

 

the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2010 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of september 30 2010 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded 

the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the cumulative cash flow projections of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below their carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the company’s reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2010 ranged from approximately 15 to 76 

the work number revenues have been strong historically having grown at a double digit compound annual growth rate since our acquisition of the reporting unit on may 17 2007 therefore revenue growth is expected to continue for each of the years used in the preparation of the discounted cash flows the actual growth rate for the work number would have to decline to a compounded rate of 5 growth with all other factors held constant for the reporting unit’s fair value to drop below its carrying value however in the event that the revenue growth rate was to decline management would take action to preserve operating margins if the fair value dropped below carrying value we would compare the carrying value of the goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill to determine if a goodwill impairment charge would become necessary 

the calculated percentage excess in the latin america reporting unit at approximately 15 reflects in part the effect of the uncertain economic and competitive conditions in latin america on our actual and projected financial performance the projections used in the calculation of fair value reflect our assumption of moderate economic growth in most of these countries increases in revenue from the addition of sales staff and from new product and new customer segment initiatives and our planned spending on operating improvement initiatives in 2011 to drive improving growth and profitability particularly in brazil followed by growth for all of latin america in 2012 if our operating improvement initiatives are not successful there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and may possibly result in the recognition of an impairment loss 

 

 

 

 

the reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess of fair value over carrying value is our talent management services business which has a goodwill balance of 261 million as of september 30 2010 this reporting unit has been impacted by uncertainty in government hiring activity and as a result we have lowered our revenue growth projections while no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of september 30 2010 if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecast or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and may possibly result in the recognition of an impairment loss 

no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2010 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2010 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote 

 

judgments and uncertainties  — we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability in our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 

 

income taxes 

 

we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 

 

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 

 

judgments and uncertainties  — we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2010 279 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 71 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 

 

 

 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 

 

pension and other postretirement plans 

 

we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates salary growth expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 

 

judgments and uncertainties  — we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets 

 

we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a publicly published yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 

 

the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in setting the longterm expected rate of return management considers capital markets future expectations and the asset mix of the plan investments prior to 2008 the us pension plans investment returns were 109 130 and 75 over three five and ten years respectively the returns exceeded the sp 500 returns for similar periods of time primarily due to an asset allocation strategy where large allocations to alternative asset classes hedge fund of funds private equity real estate and real assets provided consistently higher returns with a low correlation to equity market returns these returns historically demonstrate a longterm record of producing returns at or above the expected rate of return however the dramatic adverse market conditions in 2008 skewed the traditional measures of longterm performance such as the tenyear average return the severity of the 2008 losses approximately negative 20 makes the historical tenyear average return a less accurate predictor of future return expectations our weightedaverage expected rate of return for 2011 is 775 which is the same as the 2010 expected rate in 2009 the investment returns were approximately 16 reflecting a partial recovery of the 2008 losses our weightedaverage expected rate of return declined from 802 in 2009 to approximately 775 for 2010 primarily related to the us retirement income plan which experienced lower growth due to our migration to a lower risk investment strategy with increased allocation to lower risklower return asset classes as well as the current forecast of expected future returns for our asset classes which is lower than the prior year 

 

annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 6323 million at december 31 2010 we do not expect our 2011 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2010 cost see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions  — we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material adjusting our expected longterm rate of return 773 at december 31 2010 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2011 by approximately 31 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 577 at december 31 2010 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2011 by approximately 11 million 

 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the canadian dollar the brazilian real the chilean peso and the euro for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

 

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains and losses which have historically been immaterial are recorded in our consolidated statements of income we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2010 would have increased our revenue by 496 million and our pretax operating profit by 137 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2009 would have increased our revenue by 452 million and our pretax operating profit by 133 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2010 and 2009 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate longterm senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our 2014 fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2010 our weighted average cost of debt was 54 and weightedaverage life of debt was 119 years at december 31 2010 72 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 28 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps a 100 basis point increase in the weightedaverage interest rate on our variablerate debt would have increased our 2010 interest expense by approximately 28 million 

 

based on the amount of outstanding variablerate debt we have material exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variablerate debt we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors

our direct marketing services products utilize information derived from proprietary databases consisting of consumer lifestyle and demographic information this information is acquired from thirdparty data compilers or is gathered from consumers voluntarily reporting information on product registration cards which they submit via paper electronically to a thirdparty or via the internet to websites maintained by us this permissionbased information is generally less regulated and restricted than the credit information that we maintain see “government regulation” below these databases provide us with the opportunity to develop new products to explore crossselling synergies with all of our databases our credit marketing services products utilize information derived from the creditbased consumer data that also underlies our information services segments

a number of states in the us have passed versions of security breach notification and credit file freeze legislation a file freeze enables identity theft victims or in certain states recipients of data breach notices or all consumers to place and lift a freeze on access to their credit files a freeze also imposes differing requirements on credit reporting for how and when to respond to such requests and significant differences in the fees the agencies may charge for freezerelated actions state legislatures are considering various other bills dealing with data security identity theft information brokers credit reports credit score access and use limitations use of social security numbers and public records access 

international data and privacy protection   we are subject to data protection privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we do business

·   in europe we are subject to the european union “eu” data protection laws including the comprehensive eu directive on data protection 1995 which imposes a number of obligations on equifax with respect to use of personal data and includes a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries that do not provide consumers with an “adequate” level of privacy or security the eu standard for adequacy is generally stricter and more comprehensive than that of the us and most other countries in the uk the data protection act of 1998 regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data recent regulatory limitations affect our use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the uk generally the data underlying the products offered by our uk information services and personal solutions product lines excluding our commercial services products are subject to these regulations

·   in latin america most countries generally are following the eu data protection model this includes consumer data protection and privacy laws and regulations in argentina and chile there are also constitutional provisions in argentina brazil chile peru and certain other countries which declare the right to a judicial hearing on the use of personal data and grant individuals the right to access and correct information in the possession of data controllers in many of those countries

these laws and regulations have not resulted in material changes to our business practices to date but have significantly increased our compliance costs in the us we have seen an increase in the number of notices resulting from breached thirdparty databases and in the number of consumers that contact us following a breach to obtain their credit files credit scores andor use our credit monitoring services

we generally seek protection under federal state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by contracts licenses registrations confidentiality or other agreements or protections we own several patents registered in the us and certain foreign countries we also have certain registered trademarks in the us and in many foreign countries the most important of these is “equifax” and many variations thereof these trademarks are used in connection with most of our product lines and services although these patents and trademarks are important and valuable assets in the aggregate no single patent group of patents or trademark is critical to the success of our business we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations

them which licenses have varying durations and generally provide for usagebased fees and 2 seisint inc relating to a software platform which facilitates sales by our direct marketing services and credit marketing services units which licenses have tenyear terms beginning in 2002 and may be renewed on an annual basis thereafter 

competition 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets which are highly competitive our information services products primarily compete with the products of two global consumer credit reporting companies experian and transunion which offer a range of consumer credit reporting products that are similar to products we offer we believe that our products and services offer customers an advantage over those of our competitors because of the quality of our data files which we believe to be superior in terms of depth and accuracy our competitive strategy is to rely on product features and quality while remaining competitive on price experian and the dun  bradstreet corporation are the major competitors for our commercial services products although we believe we have a unique database and product for the small business segment of that market our marketing services products also compete with these companies and others who offer demographic information products and services including acxiom corporation hartehanks inc and infousa inc we believe the marketing services products and services are superior and in some cases unique compared to those offered by our competitors at comparable prices our personal solutions products and services compete with similar offerings sold directly by experian and transunion and also with offerings from a number of resellers of consumer credit information sold by experian transunion and us we tailor our pricing of personal solutions products to the needs of the market which can change frequently due to the dynamic nature of the consumer market we change our pricing periodically to accommodate new product introductions or other market conditions we also compete with fair isaac corporation experian and transunion with respect to our analytical tools

 item 1a   risk factors 

the following risk factors and other information included in this form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described in the subsequent discussion are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be less significant may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks actually were to occur our business reputation financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to our business and growth strategy 

we have announced and are currently in the process of implementing a new longterm growth strategy and we may not be successful 

we have developed a longterm growth strategy which includes 1 increasing our share of our customers’ spending on informationrelated services through the development and introduction of new products pricing our services in accordance with the value they create for customers increasing the range of current services utilized by customers and improving the quality of sales and customer support interactions with consumers 2 increasing our customers’ use of our proprietary analytical predictive and enabling technology 3 investing in and developing new differentiated data sources that provide unique value to customers in their highest value decisioning needs and 4 expanding into key emerging 

opportunities via acquisitions partnerships andor internal development including related markets in the united states such as initiatives in the commercial collections and healthcare markets as well as new geographic markets outside the united states if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy we may not be able to grow our business growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate or our revenues net income and earnings per share may decline 

we may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses 

our longterm strategy includes growth through acquisitions and investments in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies any acquisitions or investments including our pending acquisition of talx corporation as described in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include 

·   the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined business may not be achieved

·   the possibility that we will pay more than the acquired companies or assets are worth

·   unexpected liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses

·   the difficulty of assimilating the systems operations and personnel of the acquired businesses

·   the potential disruption of our ongoing business

·   the potential dilution of our existing shareholders and earnings per share

·   unanticipated liabilities legal risks and costs

·   the distraction of management from our ongoing business and

·   the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel

these factors could harm our business results of operations or financial position particularly in the event of a significant acquisition the acquisition of businesses having a significant presence outside the us will increase our relative exposure to the risks of conducting operations in international markets 

since our revenues depend to a large extent on our customers’ demand for consumer credit information deterioration of current economic conditions may harm our results of operations 

although we continue to take steps to diversify our lines of business consumer credit reports remain a core product in general our customers use our credit information and related services to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home mortgages home equity loans and other consumer loans they also use our credit information and services to monitor existing credit relationships consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth rising rates of interest may reduce consumer demand for mortgage loans and also impact our mortgage services joint venture a decline in consumer demand for credit may reduce our customers’ demand for our consumer credit information consequently our revenues from consumer credit information products and services could be negatively affected and our results of operations harmed if consumer demand for credit decreases 

the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers strategic partners and various government and public 

record sources our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use we also compete with several of our thirdparty data suppliers if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenues net income and earnings per share 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our gross margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive as described above under “competition” we currently have a business relationship with fair isaac corporation to resell their credit scoring product and are also involved in litigation with that firm arising from our development with transunion and experian of the vantagescore sm credit scoring product which is competitive with fair isaac’s products competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services 

the sizes of our competitors vary across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share revenue or margins if we are unable to respond as quickly or effectively to changes in customer requirements as our competition our ability to expand our business and sell our products and services will be negatively affected 

some of our competitors also may choose to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technical superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms 

our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services and if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services our revenues may remain flat or decline 

to increase our revenues we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer products and services products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development we cannot assure that the marketplace will accept these products if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services such as the new vantagescore credit scoring product our ability to increase revenues or improve operating margins will be impaired 

if we fail to keep up with rapidly changing technologies our products and services could become less competitive or obsolete 

in our markets technology changes rapidly and there are continuous improvements in computer hardware network operating systems programming tools programming languages operating systems 

database technology and the use of the internet advances in technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and services and delivery formats if we fail to enhance our current products and develop new products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer preferences our products and services could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete our future success will depend in part upon our ability to internally develop new and competitive technologies use leading thirdparty technologies effectively continue to develop our technical expertise anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 

we may suffer adverse financial consequences if computer sciences corporation requires us to purchase its credit reporting business when the public equity or debt markets or other financing conditions are unfavorable to us 

in 1988 we entered into an agreement with computer sciences corporation or csc and certain of its affiliates under which csc’s credit reporting agencies utilize our computerized credit database services under this agreement csc has an option exercisable at any time to sell its credit reporting business to us the option expires in august 2013 the option exercise price will be determined by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if csc were to exercise the option today the option price would be approximately 650 million to 725 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than the estimated amount if csc were to exercise its option we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt andor equity however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the state of the equity markets general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition because we do not control the timing of csc’s exercise of its option we could be required to seek such financing and increase our debt levels at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable 

our international operations subject us to additional business risks that may reduce our profitability or revenues 

we conduct business outside the us during 2006 we generated approximately 28 of our revenues from business outside the us as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the us as a result our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control risks that could give rise to incremental costs in our international operations include political and economic instability changes in regulatory requirements and policy and the adoption of laws detrimental to our operations such as legislation relating to the collection and use of personal data negative impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences increased restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and general economic conditions in international markets we may not be able to avoid significant expenditures should one or more of these risk factors occur 

security is critically important to our business and breaches of security or the perception that ecommerce is not secure could harm our business and reputation 

businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce including that which is internetbased requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks several of our products are accessed through the internet including our consumer and commercial information services that are delivered via eport our internet delivery channel and our personal solutions services accessible through the wwwequifaxcom website security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services via eport our personal solutions website or wellpublicized security breaches not 

involving the internet that may affect us or our industry such as database intrusion could be detrimental to our business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products consumer services and proprietary database information 

if we experience system failures the delivery of our products and services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data centers some of these systems have been outsourced to thirdparty providers any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss war terrorist act telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses the steps we have taken to prevent a system failure including backup disaster recovery systems may not be successful and our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could make it more difficult to run our business and reduce our likelihood of success 

we are dependent on our ability to attract and retain experienced sales consulting research and development marketing technical support and management personnel the loss of our key employees and management might slow the achievement of important business goals we may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced technical personnel on acceptable terms because of intense competition 

we could fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 

our ability to compete effectively depends in part on the protection of our technology products services and brands through intellectual property right protections including patents copyrights database rights trade secrets and trademarks the extent to which such rights can be protected and enforced varies in different jurisdictions 

we face and could continue to face claims for intellectual property infringement 

there is a risk of litigation relating to our use or future use of intellectual property rights of third parties thirdparty infringement claims and any related litigation against us could subject us to liability for damages restrict us from using and providing our technologies products or services or operating our business generally or require changes to be made to our technologies products and services we are currently a defendant in litigation brought by fair isaac corporation arising from our development with transunion and experian of the vantagescore credit scoring product that is competitive with fair isaac’s products in which the plaintiff has alleged trademark infringement among other claims 

our agreements with key longterm customers may not be renewed 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our large customers there can be no assurance that these relationships will continue due to market competition customer requirements and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions although our largest single customer represents only slightly more than 2 of our revenue the loss of a significant number of major customers could materially adversely affect our business reputation financial condition or operating results 

our tax provisions may not be adequate 

although we believe we have made appropriate provisions for taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate on the basis of current law due to possible changes of law or challenges from tax authorities under existing laws it is possible that the provision may turn out to be insufficient and this could materially affect our financial condition 

risks relating to our industry 

changes in the legislative regulatory and judicial environments may adversely affect our ability to collect manage aggregate and use data 

the credit reporting and direct marketing industries are subject to substantial government regulation relating to individual privacy and the collection distribution and use of information about individuals the information and personal data we collect is subject to a variety of government regulations including but not limited to those described above under “government regulation” in addition public interest in individual privacy rights and the collection protection distribution and use of information about individuals may result in the adoption of new federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could include increased compliance requirements and restrictions on the purchase sale and sharing of information about consumers for commercial purposes this could have a negative impact on our ability to collect such information provided by consumers voluntarily future laws and regulations with respect to the collection management and use of data about individuals and adverse publicity judicial interpretations or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense or a loss of revenue 

the outcome of litigation or regulatory proceedings in which we are involved could be adverse 

various legal proceedings arise during the normal course of our business these include individual consumer cases class action lawsuits and actions brought by regulators while we do not currently believe that the outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial position litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us our insurance arrangements may be insufficient to cover an adverse judgment in a large lawsuit see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for information on our material pending litigation 

there may be further consolidation in our endclient markets 

to the extent that our existing clients merge with or are acquired by other entities who are not our clients or who use fewer of our services such as in the financial services sector we could be adversely impacted if the surviving entities use fewer of our services or discontinue use of our services altogether or if the number of potential clients is thereby reduced 

risks related to our common stock 

we have the ability to issue additional equity securities which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock 

the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of the thenexisting shareholders’ equity interests in us our board of directors has the authority to issue without vote or action of shareholders up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and has the ability to fix the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of any such series any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights conversion rights voting rights terms of redemption redemption prices liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of 

holders of our common stock if we issue convertible preferred stock a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common shareholders’ interest our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock but reserves the right to do so in the future in addition we are authorized to issue without shareholder approval up to 300000000 shares of common stock of which 128615662 shares were outstanding as of december 31 2006 including shares held by employee benefits trusts 

provisions in our articles of incorporation bylaws shareholder rights plan other agreements and georgia law may make it difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us even in situations that may be viewed as desirable by our shareholders 

our articles of incorporation bylaws shareholder rights plan other agreements and the general business corporation code of the state of georgia or georgia code contain provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a thirdparty to acquire control of our company for example our articles of incorporation 

·   provide for classified terms for the members of our board of directors

·   authorize our board of directors to fill vacant directorships or to increase the size of the board

·   do not authorize our shareholders to remove a director without cause

·   do not authorize our shareholders to cumulate voting in the election of directors and

·   authorize the issuance of preferred stock with such rights powers and privileges as the board of directors deems appropriate

in addition our bylaws limit the ability of shareholders to bring business before a meeting of shareholders and do not allow our shareholders to act by written consent 

we are a georgia corporation and have elected to be governed by the “business combination” and “fair price” provisions of the georgia code that could be viewed as having the effect of discouraging an attempt to obtain control of us the business combination provision generally would prohibit us from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested shareholder for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless certain designated conditions are met 

the fair price provision generally requires that absent board or shareholder approval of an acquisition or merger an interested shareholder seeking to engage in a business combination transaction with us must pay the remaining shareholders the same price for their shares as was paid by the interested shareholder to acquire beneficial ownership of 10 or more of our outstanding voting shares 

we have also implemented a shareholder rights plan sometimes referred to as a poison pill which could make it uneconomical for a thirdparty to acquire our company on a hostile basis 

these provisions could also discourage or impede a tender offer proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us even if viewed favorably by shareholders

longterm revolving credit facilities   net repayments borrowings under longterm revolving credit facilities during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 were 400 million 650 million and 1380 million respectively this activity relates to our 5000 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement “existing credit agreement” on july 24 2006 we amended and restated the existing credit agreement under the amended and restated credit agreement the “amended credit agreement” among other provisions the term was extended from august 20 2009 to july 24 2011 the applicable margin for borrowings and the annual facility fee were lowered the maximum leverage ratio as defined in the amended credit agreement was increased from 30 to 1 to 35 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio was deleted the amended credit agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes

the amended credit agreement also includes an “accordion” feature that will allow us to request an increase of up to 5000 million in the maximum borrowing commitment which cannot exceed 10 billion each member of the lending group may elect to participate or not participate in any request we make to increase the maximum borrowing commitment in addition any increase in the borrowing commitment pursuant to this accordion feature is subject to certain terms and conditions including the absence of an event of default the increased borrowing commitment may be used for general corporate purposes we are permitted and intend to request an increase in the borrowing limit under the accordion feature of this credit facility effective upon the completion of our acquisition of talx

canadian credit facility   we are a party to a credit agreement with a canadian financial institution that provides for a c250 million denominated in canadian dollars 364day revolving credit agreement which was scheduled to expire on september 30 2006 during the third quarter of 2006 however we renewed this facility through september 30 2007 at december 31 2006 there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility

payments on longterm debt   there were no material payments on longterm debt during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 and 2004 respectively during the twelve months ended december 31 2005 we redeemed the 2500 million principal amount relating to our 63 senior unsecured notes by utilizing borrowings under certain revolving credit facilities

other   at december 31 2006 79 of our debt was fixedrate debt and 21 was variablerate debt our variablerate debt consists of the previously mentioned revolving credit facilities and generally bears interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or commercial paper rate the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2006 interest rates on substantially all of our variablerate debt ranged from 56 to 57 we were in compliance with all of our financial and nonfinancial debt covenants at december 31 2006 we do not anticipate any covenant compliance issues if our acquisition of talx is consummated as presently structured

on february 15 2007 standard  poor’s corporation downgraded our senior unsecured longterm fixed debt rating from a to bbb in reaction to our public announcement of the agreement to acquire talx corporation and an additional 400 million share repurchase program due to its belief that the 

acquisition reflects a somewhat more aggressive financial policy and more leveraged financial profile sp’s rating outlook remained stable on february 16 2007 moody’s investors service changed our rating outlook to stable from positive but maintained its baa1 rating on our senior unsecured longterm fixed debt

equity transactions 

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 were as follows 

share repurchase program   under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors we purchased 60 million 42 million and 54 million common shares on the open market during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively for 2127 million 1440 million and 1380 million respectively at an average price per common share of 3564 3445 and 2557 respectively at december 31 2006 the amount available for future share repurchases under this program was 1326 million in february 2007 our board of directors amended the plan to authorize an additional repurchase of 6500 million of our common stock 400 million of such repurchase authorization is contingent on the closing of our previously described pending acquisition of talx

as discussed above following the completion of the talx acquisition we intend to repurchase approximately 700 million in equifax stock in open market transactions or in privatelynegotiated purchases the timing and nature of any such repurchases will depend on market conditions other investment opportunities applicable securities laws and other factors 

dividend payments   during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we paid cash dividends of 203 million 202 million and 150 million respectively at 016 per share 015 per share and 011 per share respectively

exercise of stock options   during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we received cash of 261 million 628 million and 281 million respectively from the exercise of stock options

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2006 the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 

 

  

1   the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling 12 million at december 31 2006 total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts for additional information about our debt see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

2   our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment which includes the lease of our technology center that expires in 2012 the lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2010 and the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048 for additional information about our operating leases see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

3   these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions and certain administrative functions these agreements expire between 2007 and 2013 for additional information about these agreements see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

4   these longterm liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension postretirement and other compensationrelated plans some of which are discounted in accordance with gaap we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments this table does not include our severance accrual related to our organizational realignment for additional information about this accrual see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

5   for future interest payments on related variablerate debt which is generally based on libor or commercial paper plus a specified margin we used the variable rate in effect at december 31 2006 to calculate these payments the variable portion of the rate at december 31 2006 excluding the margin and facility fees was between 56 and 57 for substantially all of our variable debt future interest payments related to our 5000 million revolving credit facility and trade receivablesbacked revolving credit facility are based on the borrowings outstanding at december 31 2006 through their respective maturity dates assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time future interest payments may be different depending on the borrowing activity going forward under these revolving credit facilities 

a potential significant use of cash would be the payment to computer sciences corporation “csc” if they were to exercise their option to sell their credit reporting business to us at any time prior to 2013 the option exercise price will be determined by agreement or by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if the option had been exercised at december 31 2006 the price range would have approximated 650 million to 725 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than our estimate our agreement with csc which expires on july 31 2008 also provides us with an option to purchase its credit reporting business if it does not elect to renew the agreement or if there is a change in control of csc while the agreement is in effect if csc were to exercise its option or if we were able to and decided to exercise our option then we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the capital markets for debt andor equity financing however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the state of the equity markets general economic conditions credit ratings and our financial performance and condition 

in the preceding table we have not included amounts related to future pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions as such required funding amounts have not been determined for additional information about our pension and other benefit plans see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

offbalance sheet transactions 

other than facility leasing arrangements we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities in 1998 we entered into a synthetic lease on our atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to obtain favorable financing terms with regard to this facility this 290 million lease expires in 2010 lease payments for the remaining term totaled 60 million at december 31 2006 under this synthetic lease arrangement we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the lessor in the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term we would be responsible for any 

shortfall of the sales proceeds up to a maximum amount of 232 million which equals 80 of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term the liability for this shortfall which was 14 million and 40 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively is recorded in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

letters of credit and guarantees 

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2006 and all have a maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of the operating units in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to rma holdings llc in october 2000 we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with rma to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan the operating lease which expires december 31 2011 has a remaining balance of 66 million based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments including real estate taxes at december 31 2006 

in september 2005 rma sold substantially all of its assets to nco group inc “nco” after obtaining approval from the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of ohio eastern division in conjunction with this sale nco agreed to assume the operating lease obligations discussed above which we will continue to guarantee we believe that the likelihood of demand for payment by us is minimal and expect no material losses to occur related to this guarantee accordingly we do not have a liability on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2006 or 2005 related to this guarantee for additional information regarding this transaction see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

other contingencies 

there are other matters which we are involved in such as legal proceedings claims and litigation for which the final outcome and impact to our consolidated financial statements is uncertain at december 31 2006 for additional information about these matters see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

pension plans 

pension benefits are provided through us and canadian defined benefit pension plans and two supplemental executive defined benefit pension plans substantially all employees participate in one or more of these plans the measurement date for our defined benefit pension plans is december 31 st of each year

prior to january 1 2005 we had one noncontributory qualified retirement plan covering most us salaried employees the us retirement income plan or “usrip” and a defined benefit plan for most salaried employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or “crip” benefits of both plans are primarily a function of salary and years of service on january 1 2005 we separated the usrip into two defined benefit plans subject to the employee retirement income security act “erisa” the new plan the equifax inc pension plan “eipp” was funded in january 2005 with the transfer of 170 million of assets from the usrip and a company contribution of 200 million in november 2005 an additional 301 million of plan assets were transferred from the usrip to the eipp the eipp covers all active employee participants of equifax as of january 1 2005 and the usrip covers all inactive retired and vested participants as of that date inactive participants constituted approximately 85 of total participants prior to the separation the benefits of participants in both plans were unaffected by the separation the two groups of participants—active and inactive—had projected patterns of actuarial liabilities which were markedly different due to the demographic differences between the two populations the two plans have separate assumed rates of return and separate asset allocation strategies which will 

allow us to more efficiently fund our pension liabilities additionally the assets of one plan will not be available to fund the liabilities of the other plan the crip was not impacted by the separation of the usrip 

at december 31 2006 the usrip and the eipp met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements we do not expect to have to make any minimum funding contributions under erisa for 2007 with respect to the usrip or the eipp based on applicable law as currently in effect in january 2006 and 2007 however we made discretionary contributions of 200 million and 120 million respectively to the eipp we also made a 20 million discretionary contribution in 2006 to fund our other postretirement benefit plans in the future we will make minimum funding contribution as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs 

in august 2006 the federal pension protection act of 2006 was enacted included in this law are changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes as well as minimum contribution levels required in 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of this new pension law may have on our future funding requirements and our consolidated financial statements 

we increased the discount rate assumption used to measure the projected pension obligations from 568 at december 31 2005 to 586 at december 31 2006 the increase in discount rate is due to the general increase in longterm interest rates during 2006 and the consequent effect on the yields of the hypothetical portfolio of longterm corporate bonds which are used to determine the discount rate our aggregated projected benefit obligation of all plans increased slightly from 5797 million at december 31 2005 to 5827 million at december 31 2006 at december 31 2006 the supplemental retirement plans were unfunded with respect to their accumulated benefit obligation by 437 million as determined by sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” “sfas 87” whereas the usrip eipp and crip were overfunded with respect to their accumulated benefit obligation by 657 million 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual longterm investment gain on those assets the expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate annual expense was 800 for the usrip and 825 for the eipp for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 and 2005 and 875 for the usrip for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 in 2007 the expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate the annual sfas 87 expense will be 800 for the usrip and 825 for the eipp 

for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

for additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans including the impact of adopting sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

related party transactions 

we engage in various transactions and arrangements with related parties we believe the terms of the transactions and arrangements do not differ from those that would have been negotiated with an independent party for additional information about our related parties including the associated transactions and arrangements see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

inflation 

we do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results however inflation could adversely affect our future operating results 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see notes 1 and 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our processing of transactions related to the provision of information services to our customers in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the service is provided 

if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the determination of certain of our marketing information services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual reported volumes reported by our customers in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained 

we have certain information solution offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our enabling technologies personnel training services andor statistical models to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer and there must exist objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered elements for certain customer contracts the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate elements for accounting arrangement consideration may only be recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer 

valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill   goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses we review goodwill for impairment based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” in accordance with sfas 142 goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30 th  during 2006 we were not required to test goodwill for impairment at an interim date

in accordance with sfas 142 we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level as defined by reference to our operating segments determined under sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” 

in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment we use projections of future discounted cash flows from our reporting units to determine whether the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value our estimates of fair value for each reporting unit are corroborated by market multiple comparables the use of different estimates or assumptions within our projected discounted cash flows eg growth rates future economic conditions discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and could result in a goodwill impairment charge additionally a change in our reporting unit structure would result in the requirement to test goodwill for impairment at different reporting units during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances for additional information about goodwill see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

as a result of the change in operating segments effective january 1 2007 our reporting units under which we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas 142 have also changed during the first quarter of 2007 we have reallocated the goodwill associated with our previous reporting units in accordance with sfas 142 to our new reporting units we are currently in the process of testing the goodwill related to our new reporting units for impairment 

indefinitelived intangible assets   indefinitelived intangible assets consist of contractualterritorial rights representing the estimated fair value of rights to operate in certain territories acquired through the purchase of independent credit reporting agencies in the us and canada our contractualterritorial rights are perpetual in nature and therefore the useful lives are considered indefinite indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized

in accordance with sfas 142 we are required to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances change that would indicate the asset might be impaired we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value we perform our annual impairment test as of september 30 th  during 2006 we were not required to test contractualterritorial rights for impairment at an interim date

we estimate the fair value of our contractualterritorial rights based on projected discounted future cash flows the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our contractualterritorial rights or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our contractualterritorial rights and could result in an impairment charge the most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate growth rate and charge for contributory assets we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

if any legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors were to limit the useful lives of our indefinitelived intangible assets we would be required to test these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” and amortize the intangible asset over its remaining useful life 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we recognized no impairment charges related to our contractualterritorial rights for additional information about contractualterritorial rights see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

longlived assets   we monitor the status of our longlived assets annually or more frequently if necessary in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset or asset group may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner in which an asset is used underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate recoverability based on the asset’s or asset group’s ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset or asset group we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related longlived asset or asset group if the carrying value of the longlived asset or asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value we utilize the discounted present value of the associated future estimated cash flows to determine the asset’s or asset group’s fair value which requires us to make assumptions regarding the discount rate the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to among other things relevant market factors revenue growth if any and operating margins while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions in future periods may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements there were no impairment charges during the twelve months ended december 31 2006 and 2005 during the twelve months ended december 31 2004 we recorded a 24 million impairment charge

loss contingencies 

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable 

and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability in our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective changes in these assumptions in future periods or an outcome different than our assumption may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our contingencies see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income a valuation allowance is currently set against certain net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income or other tax planning strategies significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe they are probable of being sustained under such examinations regularly we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals we adjust our income tax provision during the period in which we determine that the actual results of the examinations may differ from our estimates changes in tax laws and rates are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which they occur 

changes in these assumptions in future periods or actual results different from our estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our income taxes see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

pension plans 

our pension plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas 87 and for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 sfas 158 our prepaid pension asset and total accrued pension benefit liability including shortterm and longterm liabilities in accordance with sfas 158 as of december 31 2006 were 477 million or 3 of total assets and 512 million or 5 of the total liabilities respectively on our consolidated balance sheet we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension plans critical because our management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates salary growth expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality rates 

we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the expected return on plan assets and 2 the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets is 

primarily based on two methods prepared by an external advisor which consider among other things 1 the expected equity returns based on assumptions such as dividend yield and growth rate and 2 estimated risk premium for various asset categories these assumptions are projected using an assetliability forecasting model which produces a range and distribution of values for the assumed rate of return adjusting our expected longterm rate of return 799 at december 31 2006 by 05 would change our estimated pension expense in 2007 by approximately 27 million we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 586 at december 31 2006 by 05 would change our estimated pension expense in 2007 by approximately 26 million 

depending on the assumptions and estimates used the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our pension plans see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the euro the canadian dollar and the brazilian real for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature within other comprehensive income as a component of our shareholders’ equity other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of income we do not as a matter of policy hedge translational foreign currency exposure we may however hedge transactional foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

at december 31 2006 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2006 would have increased our revenue by 422 million and our pretax operating profit by 128 million at december 31 2005 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2005 would have increased our revenue by 378 million and our pretax operating profit by 111 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit for 2006 and 2005 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variablerate longterm revolving credit facility and trade receivablesbacked revolving credit facility we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weightedaverage cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floatingrate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2006 our weighted average cost of debt was 57 and weightedaverage life of debt was 72 years at december 31 2006 79 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 21 was variable rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 

based on current mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt which is comparable to the prior year we do not have material exposure to interest rate risk in the future if our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing variablerate credit facilities or new variablerate debt instruments we could have exposure to interest rate risk the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and variablerate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors 

for additional information about our debt including interest rates at december 31 2006 see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k

product development 

our products and services are based on proprietary technology and databases enabling customers to operate their businesses efficiently and effectively we constantly expand our product and service offerings through internal development partnering with third parties and through acquisitions 

data sources 

we rely extensively on data from external sources for our proprietary and nonproprietary databases these sources include financial or credit granting institutions which provide loan and accounts receivable information governmental entities which provide public records of bankruptcies liens and judgments and consumers who participate in surveys and submit warranty cards from which we gather demographic and marketing information our information services product line relies predominately on data received from customers via contractual relationships and from various government and public record services additionally in the us we also rely on a contractual relationship with computer sciences corporation a division of which is a third party affiliate to provide us data in certain geographic areas outside of the us governmental data sources are generally more significant to our business 

our marketing services operating segment with the exception of the credit marketing services products is derived from proprietary databases consisting of consumer lifestyle and demographic information the majority of this information is gathered by consumers reporting information on warranty cards voluntarily providing information via websites maintained by us or otherwise requesting certain types of information this permissionbased information is generally less regulated and restricted than the credit information that we maintain see “government regulation” below these databases provide us with the opportunity to develop new products to explore crossselling synergies with all of our databases our credit marketing services products utilize information derived from the creditbased consumer data that also underlies our information services segments 

the databases underlying our information services and marketing services segments include numerous generalized databases and specialized databases of varying sizes some of these databases are subject to regulatory or contractual restrictions regarding usage all databases are regularly updated by information provided by banks financial institutions telecommunications companies other trade credit 

providers and governments and we are committed to enhancing expanding and maintaining the integrity of our proprietary databases our personal solutions product line relies on the consumer credit information databases which support our consumer services products 

government regulation 

since our business involves the collection of consumer data and the distribution of such information to businesses who make credit service and marketing decisions certain of our activities and products and services are subject to regulation under various local state and federal laws in the us governing consumer report data and consumer reporting agencies including the fair credit reporting act “fcra” which regulates the use of consumer credit information and to a lesser extent the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal financial information held by financial institutions the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 “fact act” amended the fcra and became law in december 2003 during 2004 as required by the fact act we established along with the other nationwide credit reporting agencies a centralized request facility central source llc which is owned jointly by equifax experian information solutions inc “experian” and transunion llc “transunion” to provide to consumers upon their request a free annual credit file disclosure on a phasedin between december 1 2004 and september 1 2005 additional provisions of the fact act impose requirements designed to reduce consumer identity theft limit provision of medical information and require reports to the federal trade commission “ftc” regarding consumer complaints for additional information on the fact act see part i item ia “risk factors—risks relating to regulation and litigation” and part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we continue to monitor federal and state legislative and regulatory issues involving consumer data privacy and protection much of this activity resulted from highly publicized third party security breaches in early 2005 involving personal financial data while numerous bills have been introduced and a few have become law at the state level governing matters such as the right of consumers to “freeze” the credit files maintained by credit reporting agencies under certain circumstances and security breach notification provisions these have not resulted in significant changes to our business practices we expect to see an increase in the number of notices resulting from breached third party databases and the number of consumers that contact credit reporting companies following a breach at the federal level congress has held hearings and drafted various bills dealing with data security and identity theft issues we cannot predict the outcome of any of these bills in 2006 and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements the fcra as amended in 2003 contains a number of significant identity theft protections for consumers and we continue to work with regulators to fully implement all of its provisions 

we are also subject to privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in foreign countries where we do business including the european union’s privacy directive the uk’s data protection act of 1998 regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data recent regulatory limitations affect our use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the uk generally the data underlying the products offered by our uk information services and personal solutions product lines excluding our commercial services products are subject to these regulations 

the information underlying our us commercial services and direct marketing services business is less regulated than the other portions of our business a significant portion of the information maintained by our marketing services business is voluntarily provided by individuals rendering it subject to fewer restrictions on use it is our policy however to treat all information with a high degree of security reflecting our recognition of individuals’ privacy concerns 

intellectual property 

we generally seek protection under federal state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business certain intellectual property where appropriate is protected by contracts licenses registrations confidentiality or other agreements or protections we own several patents registered in the us and certain foreign countries the more important of which cover various aspects of and relate to the use of data within a consumer credit file we also have certain registered trademarks in the us and in many foreign countries the most important of these is “equifax” and many variations thereof these marks are used in connection with most of our product lines and services although these patents and trademarks are important and valuable assets in the aggregate no single patent group of patents or trademark is critical to the success of our business we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations 

we license other companies to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights we own or control primarily as core components of our products and services on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards 

we are licensed by others to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control none of which is material to our business except for licenses from 1 fair isaac corporation relating to certain credit scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived therefrom which licenses have varying durations and generally provide for usagebased fees and 2 seisint inc relating to a software platform which facilitates sales by our direct marketing services and credit marketing services units which licenses have tenyear terms beginning in 2002 and may be renewed on an annual basis thereafter 

competition 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets which are highly competitive our information services products primarily compete with the products of two global consumer credit reporting companies experian and transunion which offer a range of consumer credit reporting products that are similar to products we offer we believe that our products and services offer customers an advantage over those of our competitors because of the quality of our data files which we believe to be superior in terms of depth and accuracy our competitive strategy is to rely on product features and quality while remaining competitive on price experian and dun  bradstreet inc are the major competitors for our commercial services products although we believe we have a unique database and product for the small business segment of that market our marketing services products also compete with these companies and others who offer demographic information products and services including acxiom corporation hartehanks inc and infousa inc we believe the marketing services products and services are superior and in some cases unique compared to those offered by our competitors at comparable prices our personal solutions products and services compete with similar offerings sold directly by experian and transunion and also with offerings from a number of resellers of consumer credit information sold by experian transunion and us we tailor our pricing of personal solutions products to the needs of the market which can change frequently due to the dynamic nature of the consumer market we change our pricing periodically to accommodate new product introductions or other market conditions

 item 1a   risk factors

the following risk factors and other information included in this form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be less significant may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks actually were to occur our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to our business 

since our revenues depend to a large extent on our customers’ demand for consumer credit information deterioration of current economic conditions may harm our results of operations 

consumer credit reports constitute our core product in general our customers use our credit information and related services to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home mortgages and refinancing and other consumer loans they also use our credit information and services to monitor existing credit relationships consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth rising rates of interest may reduce consumer demand for mortgage loans a decline in consumer demand for credit may reduce our customers’ demand for our consumer credit information consequently our revenues from consumer credit information products and services could be negatively affected and our results of operations harmed if consumer demand for credit decreases 

the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers and various government and public record services our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use if a substantial number of data sources were to withdraw their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenues net income and earnings per share 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our gross margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive in consumer credit reporting services we compete primarily with two global consumer credit reporting companies experian and transunion we also compete with these and other companies including acxiom corporation hartehanks inc and infousa inc with respect to our direct marketing services fair issac corporation experian and transunion with respect to our analytical tools and a variety of software companies with respect to our enabling technologies competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services 

the sizes of our competitors vary across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in each of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share if we are unable to respond as quickly or effectively to changes in customer requirements as our competition our ability to expand our business and sell our products and services will be negatively affected 

some of our competitors may also be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technical superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new commercial relationships on favorable terms 

our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services and if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services our revenues may decline 

to increase our revenues we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer products and services products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development we cannot assure that the marketplace will accept these products if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services our ability to increase revenues will be impaired 

if we fail to keep up with rapidly changing technologies our products and services could become less competitive or obsolete 

in our markets technology changes rapidly and there are continuous improvements in computer hardware network operating systems programming tools programming languages operating systems database technology and the use of the internet advances in technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and services and delivery formats if we fail to enhance our current products and develop new products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer preferences our products and services could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete our future success will depend in part upon our ability to internally develop new and competitive technologies use leading thirdparty technologies effectively continue to develop our technical expertise anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 

we may suffer adverse financial consequences if computer sciences corporation requires us to purchase its credit reporting business when the public equity or debt markets or other financing conditions are unfavorable to us 

in 1988 we entered into an agreement with computer sciences corporation or csc and certain of its affiliates under which csc’s credit reporting agencies utilize our computerized credit database services under the agreement csc has an option exercisable at any time to sell its credit reporting business to us the option expires in august 2013 the option exercise price will be determined by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if csc were to exercise the option today the option price would be approximately 650 million to 700 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the businesses current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than the estimated amount if csc were to exercise its option we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt andor equity however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the state of the equity markets general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition because we do not control the timing of csc’s exercise of its option we could be required to seek such financing and increase our debt levels at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable 

our international operations subject us to additional business risks that may reduce our profitability or revenues 

we conduct business outside the us during the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 we received approximately 26 of our revenues from business outside the us as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the us as a result our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control the risks and potential costs of our international operations include political and economic instability changes in regulatory requirements and policy and the adoption of laws detrimental to our operations such as legislation relating to the collection and use of personal data negative impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences increased restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and general economic conditions in international markets we may not be able to avoid significant expenditures in addressing these potential risks 

security is important to our business and breaches of security or the perception that ecommerce is not secure could harm our business 

businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce including that which is internetbased requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks several of our products are accessed through the internet including our consumer and commercial information services that are delivered via eport™ our internet delivery channel and our personal solutions services accessible through the wwwequifaxcom website security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services via eport™ our personal solutions website or wellpublicized security breaches not involving the internet that may affect us or our industry such as database intrusion could be detrimental to our business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products consumer services and proprietary database information 

if we experience system failures the delivery of our products and services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data centers some of these systems have been outsourced to third party providers any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses the steps we have taken to prevent a system failure including backup disaster recovery systems may not be successful and our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

we may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses 

we have made in the past and may make in the future acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include 

·   the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined business may not be achieved

·   the possibility that we will pay more than the acquired companies or assets are worth

·   unexpected liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses

·   the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses

·   the potential disruption of our ongoing business

·   the potential dilution of our existing shareholders and earnings per share

·   unanticipated liabilities legal risks and costs

·   the distraction of management from our ongoing business and

·   the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel

these factors could harm our business results of operations or financial position particularly in the event of a significant acquisition the acquisition of businesses having a significant presence outside the us will increase our relative exposure to the risks of conducting operations in international markets 

the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could make it more difficult to run our business and reduce our likelihood of success 

we are dependent on the principal members of our management and technical computer information systems staff we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers other than richard f smith chairman and chief executive officer and donald t heroman chief financial officer the loss of our management and key technical employees might slow the achievement of important business goals it is also critical to our success that we recruit and retain qualified technical personnel to perform development work we may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced technical personnel on acceptable terms because of intense competition 

risks related to our common stock 

we have the ability to issue additional equity securities which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock 

the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of the thenexisting shareholders’ equity interests in us our board of directors has the authority to issue without vote or action of shareholders up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and has the ability to fix the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of any such series any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights conversion rights voting rights terms of redemption redemption prices liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock if we issue convertible preferred stock a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common shareholders’ interest our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock but reserves the right to do so in the future in addition we are authorized to issue without shareholder approval up to 300000000 shares of common stock of which 133534624 shares were outstanding as of december 31 2005 including shares held by employee benefits trusts 

provisions in our articles of incorporation bylaws shareholder rights plan other agreements and georgia law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us even in situations that may be viewed as desirable by our shareholders 

our articles of incorporation bylaws shareholder rights plan other agreements and the general business corporation code of the state of georgia or georgia code contain provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of our company for example our articles of incorporation 

·   provide for classified terms for the members of our board of directors

·   authorize our board of directors to fill vacant directorships or to increase the size of the board

·   do not authorize our shareholders to remove a director without cause

·   do not authorize our shareholders to cumulate voting in the election of directors and

·   authorize the issuance of preferred stock with such rights powers and privileges as the board of directors deems appropriate

in addition our bylaws limit the ability of shareholders to bring business before a meeting of shareholders and do not allow our shareholders to act by written consent 

we are a georgia corporation and have elected to be governed by the “business combination” and “fair price” provisions of the georgia code that could be viewed as having the effect of discouraging an attempt to obtain control of us the business combination provision generally would prohibit us from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested shareholder for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless certain designated conditions are met 

the fair price provision generally requires that absent board or shareholder approval of an acquisition or merger an interested shareholder seeking to engage in a business combination transaction with us must pay the remaining shareholders the same price for their shares as was paid by the interested shareholder to acquire beneficial ownership of 10 or more of our outstanding voting shares 

we have also implemented a shareholder rights plan also called a poison pill which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire our company on a hostile basis 

these provisions could also discourage or impede a tender offer proxy contest or other similar transactions involving control of us even if viewed favorably by shareholders 

risks relating to regulation and litigation 

compliance with recent amendments to the fcra have increased our compliance costs 

the fact act which amended the fcra became law in december 2003 beginning on december 1 2004 the fact act among other things required us on an annual basis to provide free credit reports to consumers upon request these reports may be requested by internet telephone or mail through centralized request facilities which we and other nationwide credit reporting agencies must establish and support in addition subject to final regulations to be adopted by the ftc consumers will be entitled to a free credit report upon request if a report results in the consumer obtaining credit terms less favorable than those provided to a majority of the credit provider’s customers also known as riskbased pricing the fact act also requires us to provide credit scores to requesting consumers for a reasonable fee as determined by the ftc 

the ftc has issued regulations to implement many of these requirements including establishment of the centralized request facilities and development of procedures to phasein such requests the phasein was completed on september 1 2005 additional provisions of the fact act impose requirements designed to reduce consumer identity theft limit provision of medical information and require reports to the ftc regarding consumer complaints we have modified our procedures and systems to deal with these and other fact act provisions where applicable 

we have incurred significant compliance costs to implement the fact act requirements and we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the ftc’s regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the net impact of the free report disclosure and other requirements of the fact act on our business will depend on numerous factors including among others the actual demand of consumers for free credit reports our ability to increase fees to customers to recover these regulatory costs our experience marketing feegenerating products to consumers requesting free credit file disclosures the ftc’s final determination of the fee we can charge for providing credit score disclosures to requesting consumers the actual cost of resolving additional credit file and credit score reinvestigation requests from consumers and approval of final ftc and federal reserve board rules on riskbased pricing transactions and other matters 

changes in the legislative regulatory and judicial environments may adversely affect our ability to collect manage aggregate and use data 

our business involves collection of consumer and business data and distribution of such information to businesses making credit and marketing decisions consequently certain of our activities and services are subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and canada and in those countries within europe and latin america where we do business for instance much of the data and services that we provide are subject to regulation under the fcra which regulates the use of consumer credit information and to a lesser extent the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal information held by financial institutions 

we are also subject to the uk’s data protection act of 1998 which regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data and recent regulatory limitations relating to use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the uk in addition public interest in individual privacy rights and the collection distribution and use of information about individuals may result in the adoption of new federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could include increased compliance requirements and restrictions on the purchase sale and sharing of information about consumers for commercial purposes and have a negative impact on our ability to collect such information provided by consumers voluntarily future 

international federal state and local laws and regulations with respect to the collection management and use of data about individuals and adverse publicity judicial interpretations or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense or a loss of revenue the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages penalities or injunctive relief against us

for additional key performance indicators related to nongaap financial measures and our operating segments see exhibit 991 to this form 10k and further discussion below respectively 

business environment 

our financial condition and operating performance are driven primarily by the rate at which the us economy grows as measured by the gross domestic product as well as levels of consumer spending and confidence regarding jobs and the health of the economy changes in overall economic conditions in the us and other countries in which we operate generally impact the demand for our credit information as well as other products and services these effects are dynamic and complex for example in 2005 interest rate increases in the us began to negatively impact our mortgage business however despite this trend we achieved 13 growth in our mortgage revenue in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to the diversity of our customers and product offerings additionally we generally experience growth in our marketing services business during periods of rising interest rates lenders typically spend more on their marketing efforts in order to retain or expand market share in consumer credit markets which may mitigate the impact on us of rising interest rates and an economic downturn 

the credit information business is characterized by intense price and service competition among a limited number of providers investment in proprietary credit information databases changes in customer requirements continued consolidation in the lending credit card and telecommunications industries emerging new market segments and technological innovation being competitive requires an emphasis on efficient processing to offset price compression technological competence protection of sensitive data devotion of significant resources to marketing and applications development to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors other significant factors include product cost brand recognition customer responsiveness ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and regulatory compliance 

consolidated outlook for 2006 

looking forward we believe that the performance of our business units in 2005 discussed in detail below positions our company well for 2006 in 2006 we expect continued us economic expansion although at a slightly lower growth rate than in 2005 and 2004 

during 2006 we expect 

·   us consumer and commercial services to continue its solid performance we serve a diverse group of industries and applications within those industries which should allow this business to continue to grow and deliver a solid financial performance the value added services including predictive sciences and enabling technologies will continue to drive revenue growth

·   marketing services’ performance will primarily be driven by financial institutions’ activities in acquiring managing and collecting their account portfolios as the economy continues to expand this business should continue to grow in 2006

·   personal solutions to continue to grow in 2006 aided by consumers’ increased focus on identity theft and fiscal responsibility which drives demand for our products and services

·   latin america to continue its solid performance although at a more moderate rate than 2005 latin america’s financial performance improved dramatically in 2005 due to increased volume and higher pricing in addition new valueadd products and services contributed to revenue growth and improved competitive position in 2005

·   europe to continue to experience challenges due to the economic environment in the uk

we also expect to see opportunities for growth through our ability to identify and enhance our customers’ decisioning intelligence to more effectively interact with and serve their customers broadening our personal solutions offerings to consumers and ultimately moving our own businesses further up the value chain from data to analytics and decisioning technology—the main driver of growth and differentiation in our north america and latin america business units

consolidated operating revenue for the twelve months ended december 31 2005 increased 1706 million or 13 from 12728 million in 2004 to 14434 million in 2005 this increase is due to growth in all of our reporting segments except europe which was flat our regulatory recovery fee revenue related to the fact act contributed 380 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2005 regulatory recovery fee revenue was not material during the twelve months ended december 31 2004 see further discussion of segment financial results below

selling general and administrative costs rose 606 million or 21 in 2005 as compared to the same prior year period mainly due to higher salary incentive and benefit costs related to our chief executive

other than facility leasing arrangements we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities in 1998 we entered into a synthetic lease on our atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to obtain favorable financing terms with regard to this facility this 290 million lease expires in 2010 lease payments for the remaining term total 79 million under this synthetic lease arrangement we have guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the lessor in the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds up to a maximum amount of 232 million which equals 80 of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term based on an appraisal of the property at december 31 2004 we determined that its fair value is 250 million the 40 million shortfall against the residual value guarantee is being recognized as an expense ratably over the remaining lease term there was not a material change in the fair value of the property during 2005 

letters of credit and guarantees 

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is less than 34 million at december 31 2005 and all have a maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of operating units in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to rma holdings llc “rma” in october 2000 we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with rma to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan the operating lease which expires december 31 2011 has a remaining balance of 79 million based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments including real estate taxes at december 31 2005 

on september 12 2005 rma sold substantially all of its assets to nco group inc “nco” after obtaining approval from the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of ohio eastern division in conjunction with this sale nco agreed to assume the operating lease obligations discussed above which we will continue to guarantee we believe that the likelihood of demand for payment by us is minimal and expect no material losses to occur related to this guarantee accordingly we do not have a liability on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2005 or 2004 related to this guarantee for additional information regarding this transaction including the remaining amount of deferred revenue see notes 1 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

other contingencies 

there are other matters which we are involved in such as legal proceedings claims and litigation for which the final outcome and impact to our consolidated financial statements is uncertain at december 31 2005 for additional information about these matters see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

subsidiary dividend and fund transfer limitations 

the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited in some cases by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments which do not individually or in the aggregate materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness meet our current obligations or pay dividends 

pension plans 

pension benefits are provided through us and canadian defined benefit pension plans and two supplemental executive defined benefit pension plans substantially all employees participate in one or more of these plans the measurement date for our defined benefit pension plans is december 31 st of each year

prior to january 1 2005 we had one noncontributory qualified retirement plan covering most us salaried employees the us retirement income plan or “usrip” and a defined benefit plan for most salaried employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or “crip” benefits of both plans are primarily a function of salary and years of service 

on january 1 2005 we separated the usrip into two defined benefit plans subject to the employee retirement income security act “erisa” the new plan the equifax inc pension plan “eipp” was funded in january 2005 with the transfer of 170 million of assets from the usrip and a company contribution of 200 million in november 2005 an additional 301 million of plan assets were transferred from the usrip to the eipp the eipp covers all active employee participants of equifax as of january 1 2005 and the usrip covers all inactive retired and vested participants as of that date inactive participants constituted approximately 85 of total participants prior to the separation the benefits of participants in both plans were unaffected by the separation the two groups of participants—active and inactive—had projected patterns of actuarial liabilities which were markedly different due to the demographic differences between the two populations the two plans will have separate assumed rates of return and separate asset allocation strategies which will allow us to more efficiently fund our pension liabilities additionally the assets of one plan will not be available to fund the liabilities of the other plan the crip was not impacted by the separation of the usrip 

at december 31 2005 the usrip and the eipp met or exceeded erisa’s minimum funding requirements we do not expect to have to make any minimum funding contributions under erisa for 2006 with respect to the usrip or the eipp based on applicable law as currently in effect in january 2006 however we made a discretionary contribution of 200 million to the eipp 

we reduced the discount rate assumption used to measure the projected pension obligations from 592 for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 to 568 for the twelve months ended december 31 2005 the decrease in discount rate is due to the general decline in longterm interest rates during 2005 and the consequent effect on the yields of the portfolio of longterm corporate bonds which are used to determine the discount rate this reduction caused the aggregated projected benefit obligation of all plans to increase 282 million from 5515 million at december 31 2004 to 5797 million at december 31 2005 at december 31 2005 the eipp and supplemental retirement plans were underfunded with respect to their accumulated benefit obligation by 509 million as determined by statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” “sfas no 87” whereas the usrip and crip were overfunded with respect to their accumulated benefit obligation by 242 million 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual longterm investment gain on those assets the expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate annual expense was 875 for the usrip for the year ended december 31 2004 and was 800 for the usrip and 825 for the eipp for the year ended december 31 2005 in 2006 the expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate the annual sfas no 87 expense will be 800 for the usrip and 825 for the eipp the same as 2005 

for our nonus retirement taxqualified retirement plans we fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 

related party transactions 

we engage in various transactions and arrangements with related parties we believe the terms of the transactions and arrangements do not differ from those that would have been negotiated with an independent party for additional information about these transactions and arrangements see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

inflation 

we do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results however inflation could adversely affect our future operating results 

recent accounting pronouncements 

the following are recently issued accounting pronouncements 

stockbased compensation 

in december 2004 sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” was issued which replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas no 123” and supersedes accounting principles board no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas no 123r requires that the cost relating to sharebased payment transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services from either employees or nonemployees be recognized in the financial statements as the goods are received or services are rendered related to this guidance in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 107 “sharebased payment” “sab 107” which expressed the sec’s views regarding the interaction between sfas no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations 

we adopted sfas no 123r in january 2006 which applies to all of our outstanding unvested sharebased payment awards as of january 1 2006 and all prospective awards we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as opposed to the modified retrospective transition method under the modified prospective transition method financial statements prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r remain unchanged the following discusses several other elections we made as a result of adopting sfas no 123r 

·   for our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 we used the blackscholes option pricing model upon the adoption of sfas no 123r we will compute the fair value of options granted on or after january 1 2006 using the binomial model additionally based on the guidance in sab 107 we will change our expected volatility assumption used in the binomial model we expect the compensation expense to be slightly lower using the binomial model as opposed to the blackscholes model however the assumptions used in the model have a significant impact on the valuation we will revisit all assumptions at each grant date the fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r calculated using the blackscholes model will remain unchanged 

·   forfeitures under sfas no 123 were recognized when they occurred sfas no 123r however requires forfeitures to be estimated at the grant date accordingly compensation cost will be recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest there may be adjustments in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates for nonvested shares granted prior to our adoption of sfas no 123r we recorded a cumulative catchup adjustment in january 2006 related to estimated forfeitures the adjustment was not material to our consolidated financial statements

·   generally our stock options have graded vesting while our nonvested shares have cliff vesting sfas no 123r permits entities to elect between the accelerated recognition method or straightline recognition method for recognizing compensation cost related to awards with graded vesting based on a service condition consistent with our prior practice we intend to continue to apply the accelerated recognition method related to awards with graded vesting which results in more compensation cost early in the vesting period

upon the adoption of sfas no 123r we began recognizing compensation cost related to new stockbased awards from the grant date through the date the employee is eligible to receive the award without further service such as when the employee becomes retirement eligible which may be shorter than the stated vesting period “new policy” for stockbased awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r with accelerated vesting terms we recognized compensation cost over the stated vesting period this recognition policy will continue for any such awards that are unvested at the time of adoption if we had recognized compensation cost related to all stockbased awards granted in prior periods under the new policy in our pro forma disclosures the compensation cost and earnings per share amounts would not have been materially different than our historical pro forma disclosures 

we do not expect to change our policies related to stockbased awards such as the quantity or type of instruments issued as a result of adopting sfas no 123r nor do we plan on changing the terms of our stockbased awards we generally issue stock options and nonvested shares each year to certain employees which typically vest based on service over a three year period our stockbased awards have accelerated vesting features upon retirement at december 31 2005 our total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock and stock options was 132 million with a weighted average recognition period of 26 years and 40 million with a weighted average recognition period of 09 years respectively 

we estimate that the adoption of sfas no 123r will reduce our 2006 fully diluted earnings per share on a consolidated basis by approximately 005 this estimate however is subject to change based on a number of factors including without limitation the number terms and conditions of new stock awards and the fair value at date of grant of such awards 

income taxes 

on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act was signed into law in december 2004 financial accounting standards board staff position no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” “fsp 1092” was issued fsp 1092 specifically addresses the onetime deduction of 85 of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated we did not elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations

application of critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably 

likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with sec sab no 104 “revenue recognition” a significant portion of our revenues is based upon transactional activity generated by customers’ access to or queries of our propriety data bases product or service delivery and customer acceptance is inherent in this process by nature of the value thereby transferred to and utilized by the customer revenues are typically usage based and incorporate predetermined volumetiered unit pricing 

revenue from and customer billing for the sale of complementary information service products such as the development of unique decision or predictive statistical models and the sale of marketing service products such as demographic data lists data queries and market research is recognized upon delivery and customer acceptance 

revenue for contracts containing multiple elements that can be divided into separate units of accounting is allocated to those separate units based on their relative fair values if the relative fair value cannot be determined for a particular deliverable then the associated component of the arrangement fees is deferred and combined with the amount allocable to the applicable undelivered elements of the total arrangement fee and recognized when those elements have been delivered and accepted by the customer multiple deliverable arrangements generally involve the delivery of services generated by various product lines the distinction between product lines facilitates the separation of the contract’s deliverables into separate units of accounting no specific product line impacts the value or usage of other deliverables in the arrangement and each deliverable can be sold alone or purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the remaining deliverables 

we consider revenue recognition to be critical to all of our operating segments due to the impact on our results of operations 

valuation of longlived assets goodwill and intangible assets 

longlived assets   we monitor the status of our longlived assets annually or more frequently if necessary in order to determine if conditions exist or events and circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired in that its carrying amount may not be recoverable significant factors that are considered that could be indicative of an impairment include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner in which an asset is used underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends if potential indicators of impairment exist we estimate recoverability based on the asset’s ability to generate cash flows greater than the carrying value of the asset we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows arising from the use and eventual disposition of the related longlived asset group if the carrying value of the longlived asset group exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss is recorded based on the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value we utilize the discounted present value of the associated future estimated cash flows to determine the asset’s fair value the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to among other things relevant market factors revenue growth if any and operating margins while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions in future periods may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements there was no impairment charge 

during the year ended december 31 2005 for additional information about the charges in 2004 and 2003 see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

goodwill   goodwill is the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses we review goodwill for impairment based on the requirements of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas no 142” in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of september 30 th  during 2005 we were not required to test goodwill for impairment at an interim date

in accordance with sfas no 142 we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level as defined by reference to our operating segments determined under sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” we have five reporting units for which we test goodwill for impairment information services marketing services personal solutions europe and latin america 

in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment we use projections of future discounted cash flows from our reporting units to determine whether the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value our estimates of fair value for each reporting unit are corroborated by market multiple comparables the use of different estimates or assumptions within our projected discounted cash flows  eg growth rates future economic conditions discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge additionally a change in our reporting unit structure would result in the requirement to test goodwill for impairment at different reporting units during the twelve months ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances for additional information about goodwill see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

indefinitelived intangible assets   our contractualterritorial rights recorded in goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets are perpetual in nature and therefore the useful lives are considered indefinite the balance of our contractualterritorial rights represents the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition

in accordance with sfas no 142 we are required to test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances change that would indicate the asset might be impaired we perform the impairment test for our indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value an impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value we perform our annual impairment test as of september 30 th  during 2005 we were not required to test contractualterritorial rights for impairment at an interim date

we estimate the fair value based on projected discounted future cash flows the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our contractualterritorial rights or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our contractualterritorial rights and could result in an impairment charge the most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate and the growth rate we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 

if any legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors were to limit the useful lives of our indefinitelived intangible assets we would be required to test these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” and amortize the intangible asset over its remaining useful life 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we recognized no impairment charges related to our contractualterritorial rights for additional information about contractualterritorial rights see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

contingencies 

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated settlement if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective changes in these assumptions in future periods or an outcome different than our assumption may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our contingencies see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning opportunities and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of income a valuation allowance is currently set against certain net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income or other tax planning opportunities significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 

our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe they are probable of being sustained under such examinations regularly we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals we adjust our income tax provision during the period in which we determine that the actual results of the examinations may differ from our estimates changes in tax laws and rates are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which they occur 

changes in these assumptions in future periods or actual results different from our estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our income taxes see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

pension plans 

our pension plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 87 our prepaid pension asset and accrued benefit liability as of december 31 2005 were 1837 million or 10 of total assets and 509 million or 5 of the total liabilities respectively on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension plans critical because our management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates salary growth expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality rates 

we believe that the most critical assumptions are 1 the expected return on plan assets and 2 the discount rate the expected rate of return on plan assets is primarily based on two methods prepared by an external advisor which consider among other things 1 the expected equity returns based on assumptions such as dividend yield and growth rate and 2 estimated risk premium for various asset categories these assumptions are projected using an assetliability forecasting model which produces a range and distribution of values for the assumed rate of return adjusting our expected longterm rate of return 798 at december 31 2005 by 05 would change our estimated pension expense in 2006 by approximately 3 million we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments adjusting our weighted average discount rate 590 at december 31 2005 by 05 would change our estimated pension expense in 2006 by approximately 3 million 

depending on the assumptions and estimates used the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our pension plans see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the euro the canadian dollar and the brazilian real for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature as 

components of our shareholders’ equity other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of income we do not as a matter of policy hedge translational foreign currency exposure we may however hedge transactional foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 

at december 31 2005 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2005 would have resulted in an increase of our revenue by 378 million and an increase of our pretax operating profit by 111 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pretax operating profit 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our variable rate revolving credit debt and until july 2005 the interest rate swap agreements associated with portions of our fixed rate public debt the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and floatingrate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors 

we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2005 our weighted average cost of debt was 54 and weighted average life of debt was 75 years at december 31 2005 72 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 28 floating rate occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 

our variable rate indebtedness consists primarily of 1 our 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility 2 trade receivablesbacked revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to 1250 million subject to borrowing base availability and other terms and conditions and 3 a separate c250 million revolving credit facility in canada which is denominated in canadian dollars interest related to borrowings under these facilities is generally based on libor base rate plus a specified margin or commercial paper rates we also have a 290 million floatingtofixed interest rate swap maturing 2010 which fixes the effective rate of interest on the 290 million synthetic lease for our atlanta corporate headquarters this derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge was documented as fully effective under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas no 133” and was valued on a marktomarket basis as a liability totaling 16 million at december 31 2005 this interest rate swap gives us the right to receive a floating rate payment tied to threemonth libor plus a spread from the counterparty in exchange for a fixed rate payment from us the net settlements occur quarterly 

a 1 increase in the average rate of interest on the variable rate debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities during 2005 would have increased our pretax interest expense by 24 million since our interest rate swap related to the synthetic lease is fully effective in accordance with sfas no 133 our income statement is unaffected by the noncash quarterly marktomarket adjustments associated with these derivatives

general corporate 

our general corporate expenses are expenses that are incurred at the corporate level and have no clear relationship in their support of our business units and ultimately the reportable segments included are shared services and administrative and legal expenses general corporate expense increased 53 million in 2003 primarily due to higher compensation expense from salaries absorbed due to the repatriation of our previously outsourced accounting operations and human resources center 

consolidated outlook for 2005 

looking forward we believe that the performance of our business units in 2004 positions our company well for 2005 

during 2005 we expect 

·   modest improvement in the us economy the rate at which the economy grows is one of the key indicators of financial condition and operating performance for our company as the economy improves the need for our services also increases however if the economy does not improve as forecasted we expect low interest rates to sustain demand in mortgagerelated activity and to offset slower growth in our other markets

·   us consumer and commercial services will continue its solid performance revenue growth was 3 in 2004 and 14 in 2003 unit growth was 20 in 2004 and 18 in 2003 based on our ability to develop new business we expect current trends to continue and that revenue and unit growth will be sustainable for 2005 and favorable when compared to 2004

·   marketing services’ performance will depend greatly on the overall us economy year over year declines in revenue over the last two years reflects declining overall customer demand for these types of services assuming an improvement in the overall us economy however we expect revenue to grow in 2005 compared to 2004 new leadership and implementation of our new accel technology platform will support revenue growth and additional expense reductions in 2005

·   personal solutions will continue to grow aided by consumers’ increased focus on fiscal responsibility and identity theft as the fact act is fully implemented in 2005 consumer awareness regarding fiscal responsibility and identity theft should increase we have significant opportunities to market additional personal solutions products and services to consumers additionally we continue to observe positive trends in customers renewing subscriptions and ordering additional products and services

revolving credit facilities 

in august 2004 we entered into a new fiveyear 5000 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement the new facility provides for a variable interest rate tied to a base rate the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a specified margin or competitive bid options similar to those contained in the previous facility the new facility replaces a 4650 million revolving credit facility under our senior credit agreement we must comply with various financial and nonfinancial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 30 to 10 raised to 325 to 10 for four fiscal quarters in the event the csc put option described below under “contractual obligations and commercial commitments” is exercised and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 40 to 10 compliance with these financial covenants is tested quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis the nonfinancial covenants include limitations on liens subsidiary debt mergers liquidations asset dispositions and acquisitions our borrowings under this facility which have not been guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries are unsecured and will rank on parity in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding as of december 31 2004 5000 million was available and there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2004 we were in compliance with our covenants under this senior revolving credit agreement 

in september 2004 we entered into a new trade receivablesbacked revolving credit facility under the terms of the transaction a whollyowned subsidiary of equifax may borrow up to 1250 million subject to borrowing base availability and other terms and conditions equifax will use the net proceeds received from the sale of its trade receivables to the subsidiary for general corporate purposes the credit facility has an expiration date of september 6 2005 but may be extended for an additional period of up to three years if specified conditions are satisfied loans will bear interest based at commercial paper rates libor or base rate plus a specified margin outstanding debt under the facility will be consolidated on our balance sheet for financial reporting purposes as of december 31 2004 840 million was available and no amounts were outstanding under this facility 

one of our canadian subsidiaries had an unsecured 364day c1000 million revolving credit facility that expired on september 30 2004 the agreement provided for borrowings tied to the prime rate base rate libor or canadian banker’s acceptances and contains financial covenants related to interest coverage funded debt to cash flow and limitations on subsidiary indebtedness we guaranteed the indebtedness of our canadian subsidiary under this credit facility the bank agreed to carry the amounts outstanding under the facility on a demand basis following the expiration of the revolver on september 30 2004 and the remaining balance was paid in october 2004 borrowings under this loan which are included in 2003 shortterm borrowings on the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2003 were 154 million

at february 17 2005 our senior unsecured longterm debt ratings were a by standard  poor’s and baa1 by moody’s 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2004 

   

we believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities together with current cash and cash equivalent balances and access to committed and uncommitted credit facilities and the capital market if required will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter although any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty a potential extraordinary use of cash would be the option that computer science corporation “csc” can exercise to sell its credit reporting business to us at any time prior to 2013 the option exercise price will be determined by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if csc were to exercise the option today the option price would be approximately 6500 to 7000 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change if csc were to exercise its option we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank credit and the issuance of public debt or equity financings however the availability and terms of any such financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the condition of the equity markets general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition because we do not control the timing of csc’s exercise of its option we could be required to seek such financing and increase our indebtedness at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable 

we continue to evaluate our ability to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities from lenders and restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies and the repurchase and retirement of debt which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

off balance sheet transactions 

other than facility leasing arrangements we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities we have entered into a synthetic lease on our atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to provide us with favorable financing terms with regard to this facility this 290 million lease was entered into in 1998 and expires in 2010 total lease payments for the remaining term total 97 million under this synthetic lease arrangement we have also guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to the 

lessor in the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds up to a maximum amount of 232 million which equals 80 of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term based on a current appraisal of the property we determined that its fair value is 250 million the 40 million shortfall against the residual value guarantee will be subsequently recognized as an expense ratably over the remaining lease term 

letters of credit and guarantees 

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of our business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is less than 80 million we provide these guarantees from time to time to support the needs of our operating units except for our guarantee of the synthetic lease referred to above our only outstanding guarantee that is not reflected as a liability on our balance sheets was extended in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to rma holdings llc “rma” in october 2000 at which time we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with rma the operating lease which expires december 11 2011 has a remaining balance of 84 million based on the undiscounted value of remaining lease payments at december 31 2004 our obligations under such guarantee are not secured we believe the likelihood of demand for payment under this instrument is minimal and expect no material losses to occur in connection with this guarantee 

subsidiary funds transfer limitations 

the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds is limited in some cases by foreign government regulations at december 31 2004 the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries was not material 

pension plans 

our defined benefit plan at december 31 2004 the us retirement income plan “usrip” is subject to the minimum funding requirements and maximum taxdeductible contribution limitations of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” we made discretionary cash contributions to the usrip of 200 million in each of 2003 and 2004 

we reduced the discount rate assumption used to measure the projected pension and postretirement benefit obligations from 625 for the year ended december 31 2003 to 592 for the year ended december 31 2004 due to a change in the methodology used to determine the rate and a decline in the level of long term interest rates this reduction caused the projected benefit obligation to increase 238 million from 4535 million at december 31 2003 to 4773 million at december 31 2004 at december 31 2004 the usrip was unfunded with respect to its accumulated benefit obligation by 230 million as determined by sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual longterm investment gain on those assets the expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate annual expense was 875 for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2004 and will be 800 for the usrip and 825 for the eipp defined below for purposes of calculating sfas no 87 expense for 2005 

effective january 1 2005 we separated the usrip into two separate erisa defined benefits plans the new plan the equifax inc pension plan “eipp” was funded in january 2005 with a 200 million cash contribution from equifax and the transfer of 170 million of assets from the usrip to the eipp the eipp contained all active employee participants of equifax as of january 1 2005 and the usrip contained all inactive vested participants as of that date inactive participants constituted approximately 85 of total participants prior to the separation the benefits of participants in both plans were unaffected by the separation the two groups of equifax participants  active and inactive  had projected patterns of 

actuarial liabilities which were markedly different due to the demographic differences between the two populations the two plans will have separate assumed rates of return and separate asset allocation strategies which will allow the corporation to more efficiently fund its respective pension liabilities additionally the assets of one plan will not be available to fund the liabilities of the other plan we expect to maintain essentially the same funding policy as was the case prior to the separation of the pension plans 

for our nonus retirement taxqualified retirement plans we fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations 

for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits to retired participants when payable to them but accrue the associated expense and assume the liabilities as required by gaap accounting 

acquisition of appro systems inc 

equifax financed the 920 million purchase price relating to the acquisition of appro systems inc through available cash and approximately 720 million in borrowings under its existing tradereceivables backed revolving credit facility see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note 16

other 

we have an outstanding tax related matter with a canadian tax authority during 2003 we deposited 57 million representing a portion of one of the reassessment positions it is the opinion of our outside legal and tax experts that we will prevail see item 3 legal proceedings for additional information 

inflation 

we do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results however inflation could adversely affect our future operating results if it were to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in november 2002 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached a consensus on issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” eitf issue no 0021 provides guidance pertaining to the revenue recognition methodology to apply to revenue arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets the provisions of eitf issue no 0021 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 we adopted eitf issue no 0021 on july 1 2003 and it did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a revision to sfas no 132 “employer’s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” the purpose of the revision is to require additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans these additional disclosures include information describing the types of plan assets investment strategy measurements dates plan obligations cash flows and components of net periodic benefit cost recognized as revised sfas 132 enhances disclosures by providing more relevant information about the plan assets available to finance benefit payments the obligation to pay benefits and an entity’s obligation to fund the plan this revised version of sfas 132 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2003 we adopted the revisions to sfas 132 and have included the additional disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements

in december 2003 the staff of the securities and exchange commission or sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 104 or sab 104 “revenue recognition” which supersedes sab 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” sab 104’s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in sab 101 related to multipleelement revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” additionally sab 104 rescinds the sec’s related “revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers” issued with sab 101 that had been codified in sec topic 13 “revenue recognition” while the wording of sab 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf 0021 the revenue recognition principles of sab 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab 104 which was effective upon issuance we implemented sab 104 in december 2003 and it did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in may 2004 the fasb issued fsp no 1062 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare modernization act of 2003” this staff position supersedes fsp no 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” by clarifying the guidance on the recognition of the effects of the act on employers accumulated postretirement benefit obligation employers that sponsor a postretirement health care plan that provides prescription benefits that are deemed actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d benefit are eligible for a federal subsidy this subsidy is to be treated as an actuarial experience gain in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation fsp 1062 is effective for the first interim period or annual period beginning after june 15 2004 we adopted the accounting and disclosure provisions of fsp 1062 in july 2004 and it did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in july 2004 the eitf of the fasb reached consensus on issue no 0214 “whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting stock of an 

investee but exercises significant influence through other means” eitf issue no 0214 provides guidance pertaining to an investors accounting when the investor has significant influence over an investee through means other than voting stock the provisions of eitf no 0214 apply to reporting periods beginning after september 15 2004 the company’s accounting for such investments has been consistent with eitf 0214 and its adoption during the fourth quarter of 2004 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payments” sfas 123r is a revision to sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas 123r establishes standards for the accounting for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services from either employees or nonemployees this financial accounting standard requires the cost resulting from sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the entity’s financial statements as the goods are received or the services are rendered and establishes fair value as the measurement objective for the accounting for such transactions sfas 123r is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june 15 2005 and applies to a all new awards granted after june 15 2005 b modifications repurchases or cancellations occurring after june 15 2005 but pertaining to awards granted before june 15 2005 and c the unvested service component of outstanding awards granted prior to june 15 2005 we will adopt the provisions of sfas 123r in our third quarter beginning july 1 2005 and expect that its impact on our financial position or results of operations will be in the range of our sfas 123 pro forma amounts disclosed in note 1 of our notes to our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas 153 “exchanges of non monetary assets—an amendment of apb opinion no 29” sfas 153 amends apb 29 to eliminate the fair value measurement principal exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to significantly change as result of the exchange sfas 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 we will adopt the provisions of sfas 153 in july 2005 and do not expect that it will a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fsp no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” the act fsp 1092 specifically addresses the onetime tax deduction of 85 of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to the us in accordance with this fsp an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period covering the enactment of the act to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas 109 fsp 1092 requires the following disclosures for an enterprise that has not completed its evaluation of the repatriation provisions a a summary of the repatriation as it applies to the enterprise b the expected completion date of the evaluation c the expected effect on income tax expense or benefit and d the amount of unremitted earnings being considered for repatriation fsp 1092 is effective upon issuance we are utilizing the time allowed by fsp 1092 to evaluate the effect of the act as it pertains to our foreign earnings and our application of sfas 109 and have included the requisite disclosures in notes 2 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because 

they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii notes to consolidated financial statements note 1—significant accounting and reporting policies although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists for which the corresponding products have been delivered or services have rendered the pricing of which is either fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee arrangement is reasonably assured our sales are predicated upon the existence of a signed contract or purchase order which provides persuasive evidence of the arrangement pertinent terms and conditions regarding products to be delivered or services to be rendered and the related pricing methodology we consider the earnings process to be completed when we have fulfilled our specific obligations under the contract or purchase order as substantively demonstrated by evidence of product delivery or rendering of services we consider the fee arrangement to be realizable or collectible when there exists a probable expectation of customer payment 

a significant portion of our revenues is based upon transactional activity generated by customers’ access to or queries of our propriety data bases product or service delivery and customer acceptance is inherent in this process by nature of the value thereby transferred to and utilized by the customer revenues are typically usage based and incorporate predetermined volumetiered unit pricing 

a small portion of our revenue is related to subscriptionbased contracts under which the customer pays a flat fee for a preset or unlimited volume of transactions or services revenue recognition in these cases is based upon prorating the related fee over the term of the contract for preset volume contracts if the actual periodic usage is more than the relative periodic prorated volume the revenue related to the overrun is billed and recognized monthly and if actual periodic usage is less than the relative periodic prorated volume the revenue related to the underrun is deferred and recognized when cumulative volumes exceed the contracted volumes or at the end of the contract period 

in conjunction with certain products and services we charge a nonrefundable setup membership or righttouse license fee which is recognized into revenue on a straightline basis over the term of the contract 

revenue from and customer billing for the sale of complementary information service products such as the development of unique decision or predictive statistical models and the sale of marketing service products such as demographic data lists data queries and market research is recognized upon completion customer installation and acceptance 

for sales contracts having multiple elements that can be divided into separate units of accounting we allocate revenue to these separate units based on their relative fair values if relative fair values cannot be established revenue recognition is deferred until all elements under the contract have been delivered multiple deliverable arrangements generally involve delivery of multiple product lines these product lines are distinct enough to be separated into separate units of accounting each product line does not impact the value or usage of other deliverables in the arrangement and each can be sold alone or purchased from 

another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the remaining deliverables delivery of product lines generally occurs consistently over the contract period 

we consider revenue recognition to be critical to all of our operating segments due to the impact on our results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us we record a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other accounts receivable we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on our past writeoff experience ie average percentage of receivables written off historically and the length of time the receivables are past due allowances for doubtful accounts were approximately 93 million or 5 of the accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2004 accounts receivable net of allowances was approximately 1951 million or 65 of total current assets in our consolidated balance sheets of december 31 2004 we consider accounting for accounts receivable allowances critical to all of our operating segments because of the significance of accounts receivable to our current assets and operating cash flow if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if economic conditions worsened additional allowances may be required in the future which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements we reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts each period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or expense recognized could result 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets 

goodwill and certain other intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas 142 and all other longlived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we regularly evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of longlived assets principally goodwill purchased data files systems development and other deferred costs and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries may be impaired or not recoverable the significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner of use of an asset underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends in evaluating our longlived assets other than goodwill for possible impairment management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations in 2001 the fasb issued sfas 142 which among other things eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that goodwill be evaluated annually for impairment by applying a fair valuebased test we adopted the standard effective january 1 2002 for acquisitions prior to june 30 2001 and in accordance with the standard completed our first fair valuebased impairment tests by june 30 2002 during 2004 we updated our impairment evaluation and determined that reporting unit goodwill remained unimpaired 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business our consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on our management’s view of the expected outcome we periodically review claims and legal proceedings 

and assess whether we have potential financial exposure if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be estimated we accrue a liability for estimated legal fees and settlements in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning opportunities and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations a valuation allowance is currently set against certain net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income or other tax planning opportunities significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 

on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act “ajca” was signed into law the ajca includes a tax deduction of 85 of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated as defined in the ajca equifax may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations during its 2005 tax year equifax has started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision however we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after congress or the treasury department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision equifax expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the additional clarifying language the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and 1000 million due to complexity of the provisions of the ajca and pending additional clarifying language the range of possible income tax effects of potential repatriation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

retirement plans 

our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 87 and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” our minimum pension liability net of tax as of december 31 2004 was approximately 1170 million or 11 of the total liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2004 we consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because our management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates health care cost trends rates salary growth longterm return on plan assets and mortality rates depending on the assumptions and estimates used the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

risk factors 

since our revenues depend to a large extent on our customers’ demand for consumer credit information deterioration of current economic conditions or rising interest rates may harm our results of operations 

consumer credit reports constitute our core product in general our customers use our credit reports and related services to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home mortgages and refinancing and other consumer loans they also use our credit reports and services to monitor existing credit relationships consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth rising rates of interest may also negatively impact consumer demand for credit especially mortgage loan refinancing a decline in consumer demand for credit reduces our customers’ demand for our consumer credit reports consequently our revenues from consumer credit report products and services could be negatively affected and our results of operations harmed if consumer demand for credit decreases or if interest rates increase 

the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers and various government and public record services our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use if a substantial number of data sources were to withdraw their data or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenues net income and earnings per share 

compliance with recent amendments to the fair credit reporting act will increase our compliance costs which may not be offset by regulatory recovery fees and consumer marketing initiatives 

the fact act which amended the fair credit reporting act became law in december 2003 beginning on december 1 2004 the fact act among other things requires us on an annual basis to provide free credit reports to consumers upon request these reports may be requested by internet telephone or mail through centralized request facilities which we and other nationwide credit reporting agencies must establish and support in addition subject to final regulations to be adopted by the federal trade commission “ftc” consumers will be entitled to a free credit report upon request if a report results in the consumer obtaining credit terms less favorable than those provided to a majority of the credit provider’s customers “riskbased pricing” the fact act also requires us to provide credit scores to requesting consumers for a reasonable fee as determined by the ftc the ftc has issued regulations to implement many of these requirements including establishment of the centralized request facilities and development of procedures to phasein such requests beginning in the western region of the us and expanding to include the midwestern region on march 1 2005 the southern region on june 1 2005 and the eastern region on september 1 2005 additional provisions of the fact act impose requirements designed to reduce consumer identity theft limit provision of medical information and require reports to the ftc regarding consumer complaints 

we have modified our procedures and systems to deal with these and other fact act provisions where applicable we have incurred significant compliance costs to implement the fact act requirements and we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the ftc’s regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the net impact of the free report disclosure and other requirements of the fact act on our business will depend on numerous factors including among others the actual demand of consumers for free credit reports our ability to increase fees to customers to recover these regulatory costs our experience marketing 

feegenerating products to consumers requesting free credit file disclosures the ftc’s final determination of the fee we can charge for providing credit score disclosures to requesting consumers the actual cost of resolving additional credit file and credit score reinvestigation requests from consumers and approval of final ftc and federal reserve board rules on riskbased pricing transactions and other matters 

changes in the legislative regulatory and judicial environments may adversely affect our ability to collect manage aggregate and use data 

our business involves collection of consumer and business data and distribution of such information to businesses making credit and marketing decisions consequently certain of our activities and services are subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and canada and in those countries within europe and latin america where we do business for instance much of the data and services that we provide are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act “fcra” which regulates the use of consumer credit information and to a lesser extent the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal information held by financial institutions we are also subject to the uk’s data protection act of 1998 which regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data and recent regulatory limitations relating to use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the uk in addition public interest in individual privacy rights and the collection distribution and use of information about individuals may result in the adoption of new federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could include increased compliance requirements and restrictions on the purchase sale and sharing of information about consumers for commercial purposes and have a negative impact on our ability to collect such information provided by consumers voluntarily future international federal state and local laws and regulations with respect to the collection management and use of data about individuals and adverse publicity judicial interpretations or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense or a loss of revenue 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our gross margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive in consumer credit reporting services we compete primarily with two global consumer credit reporting companies experian information solutions inc and transunion llc we also compete with these and other companies including acxiom corporation hartehanks inc and infousa inc with respect to our direct marketing services we cannot assure that competitors will not develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services 

the sizes of our competitors vary across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in each of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share for instance we may face competition from new entrants to the business and consumer marketing information industry as a result of the rapid expansion of the internet which is a substantial new channel for distributing consumer and business information to the market if we are unable to respond as quickly or effectively to changes in customer requirements as our competition our ability to expand our business and sell our products and services will be negatively affected 

some of our competitors may also be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technical superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our 

competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new commercial relationships on favorable terms 

our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services and if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services our revenues may decline 

to increase our revenues we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer products and services products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development we cannot assure that the marketplace will accept these products if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services our ability to increase revenues will be impaired 

if we fail to keep up with rapidly changing technologies our products and services could become less competitive or obsolete 

in our markets technology changes rapidly and there are continuous improvements in computer hardware network operating systems programming tools programming languages operating systems database technology and the use of the internet advances in technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and services and delivery formats if we fail to enhance our current products and develop new products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer preferences our products and services could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete our future success will depend in part upon our ability to internally develop new and competitive technologies use leading thirdparty technologies effectively continue to develop our technical expertise anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 

we may suffer adverse financial consequences if computer sciences corporation requires us to purchase its credit reporting business when the public equity or debt markets or other financing conditions are unfavorable to us 

in 1988 we entered into an agreement with csc and certain of its affiliates under which csc’s credit reporting agencies utilize our computerized credit database services under the agreement csc has an option exercisable at any time to sell its credit reporting business to us the option expires in 2013 the option exercise price will be determined by an appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if csc were to exercise the option today the option price would be approximately 6500 to 7000 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the businesses current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than the estimated amount if csc were to exercise its option we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt andor equity however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the state of the equity markets general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition because we do not control the timing of csc’s exercise of its option we could be required to seek such financing and increase our debt levels at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable 

our international operations subject us to additional business risks that may reduce our profitability or revenues 

we conduct business outside of the us during the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 we received approximately 26 of our revenues from business outside the us as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the us as a result our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control the risks and potential costs of our international operations include political and economic instability changes in regulatory 

requirements and policy and the adoption of laws detrimental to our operations such as legislation relating to the collection and use of personal data negative impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences increased restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and general economic conditions in international markets we may not be able to avoid significant expenditures in addressing these potential risks 

security is important to our business and breaches of security or the perception that ecommerce is not secure could harm our business 

businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce including that which is internetbased requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks several of our products are accessed through the internet including our consumer and commercial information services that are delivered via eport™ our internet delivery channel and our personal solutions services accessible through the wwwequifaxcom website security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services via eport™ our personal solutions website or wellpublicized security breaches not involving the internet that may affect us or our industry such as database intrusion could be detrimental to our business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products consumer services and proprietary database information 

if we experience system failures the delivery of our products and services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems and data centers some of these systems have been outsourced to third party providers any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses the steps we have taken to prevent a system failure may not be successful and our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

we may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses 

we have made in the past and may make in the future acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include 

·   the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined business may not be achieved

·   the possibility that we will pay more than the acquired companies or assets are worth

·   unexpected liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses

·   the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses

·   the potential disruption of our ongoing business

·   the potential dilution of our existing stockholders and earnings per share

·   unanticipated liabilities legal risks and costs

·   the distraction of management from our ongoing business and

·   the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel

these factors could harm our business results of operations or financial position particularly in the event of a significant acquisition the acquisition of businesses having a significant presence outside the us will increase our relative exposure to the risks of conducting operations in international markets 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the euro the canadian dollar and the brazilian real for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature as components of our shareholders’ equity other immaterial foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of income we do not as a matter of policy hedge translational foreign currency exposure we will however hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with material transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency 

at december 31 2004 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2004 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues by 343 million and an increase of our pretax operating profit by 78 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenues and pretax operating profit 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our variable rate revolving credit debt and the interest rate swap agreements associated with portions of our fixed rate public debt the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixedrate and floatingrate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors 

we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2004 our weighted average cost of debt was 49 and weighted average life of debt was 67 years 

we generally target a mix of fixed and floating rate debt which lies within a range of 3070 fixed with the balance being floating rate at december 31 2004 62 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 38 floating rate we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by 

entering into interest rate swaps as of december 31 2004 we had 2790 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements outstanding with bank counterparties 

our variable rate indebtedness consists primarily of our 5000 million unsecured revolving credit facility and a separate c250 million revolving credit facility in canada the rate of interest we pay on our 5000 million facility is based on a floating rate pricing grid tied to our longterm senior unsecured debt rating we are currently rated a by standard  poor’s and baa1 by moody’s in the case of a split rating pricing is based on the higher rating ie currently a from standard  poor’s we can borrow under the facility at floating rates of interest tied to base rate and libor a competitive bid option is also available dependent on liquidity in the bank market at december 31 2004 no borrowings were outstanding and 5000 million of additional borrowing capacity was available under this facility borrowings under our canadian facility bear interest at a floating rate tied to prime libor or canadian banker’s acceptances at december 31 2004 no borrowings were outstanding and c250 million us208 million of additional borrowing capacity was available under our canadian facility 

we have interest rate swap agreements in place to float the interest rate on 2500 million of our fixed rate 63 senior unsecured notes through their maturity date in 2005 these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges were documented as fully effective under sfas 133 and were valued on a marktomarket basis as an asset totaling 56 million at december 31 2004 the offsetting liability of 56 million is included in shortterm debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets these swaps give us the right to receive fixed rate payments from the counterparties in exchange for floating rate payments from us the floating rate payments on these interest rate swaps are tied to sixmonth libor plus a spread with net settlements paid semiannually the final maturity of these interest rate swaps is july 2005 coinciding with the final maturity of the associated notes 

we also have a 290 million floatingtofixed interest rate swap maturing 2010 which fixes the effective rate of interest on the 290 million synthetic lease for our atlanta corporate headquarters this derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge was documented as fully effective under sfas 133 and was valued on a marktomarket basis as a liability totaling 31 million at december 31 2004 this interest rate swap gives us the right to receive a floating rate payment tied to threemonth libor plus a spread from the counterparty in exchange for a fixed rate payment from us the net settlements occur quarterly 

a 1 increase in the average rate of interest on the variable rate debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities during 2004 would have increased our pretax interest expense by 08 million 

a 1 increase in the average rate of interest associated with the floating rate payments due under our interest rate swap agreements during 2004 would have increased our pretax interest expense by 25 million since all of our interest rate swaps are fully effective per sfas 133 our income statement is unaffected by the noncash quarterly marktomarket adjustments associated with these derivatives

expertise into a new market another new service offering is our safety and security initiative which assists customers in meeting regulatory compliance issues and established uncovering moneylaundering risks in addition our recent acquisition of naviant provides us with the ability to offer a range of established email marketing products 

data sources 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases these sources include financial or credit granting institutions which provide accounts receivable information public records of bankruptcies liens and judgments and surveys and warranty cards from which we gather demographic and marketing information our information services product line relies predominately on data received from customers via contractual relationships and from various government and public record services additionally in the united states we also rely on contractual relationships with a limited number of affiliate third party credit reporting agencies to provide us data in certain geographic areas outside of the united states governmental data sources are generally more significant to our business 

our marketing services product line with the exception of our credit marketing services products is derived from our proprietary databases consisting of consumer lifestyle and demographic information the majority of this information is gathered by consumers reporting information on warranty cards voluntarily providing information via websites maintained by us or otherwise requesting certain types of information this permissionbased information is generally less regulated and restricted than the credit information that we maintain see “government regulation” below with the acquisition of naviant we acquired extensive databases comprised of permissionbased email information these databases provide us the opportunity to develop new products and to explore crossselling synergies with our existing databases our credit marketing services products utilize the credit based consumer data that also underlies our information services products 

the databases underlying our information services and marketing services product lines include numerous generalized databases and specialized databases of varying sizes some of these databases are subject to regulatory restrictions regarding usage all our databases are regularly updated by information provided by banks financial institutions other trade credit providers and governments and we are committed to enhancing expanding and maintaining the integrity of our proprietary databases our consumer direct product line relies on the consumer credit information databases which underlay our consumer services products 

government regulation 

because our business involves the collection of consumer data and the distribution of such information to businesses who make credit service and marketing decisions certain of our activities and products and services are subject to regulation under various local state and federal laws in the united states including the fair credit reporting act or fcra which regulates the use of consumer credit information and to a lesser extent the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal information portions of the fcra relating to prescreen services are expiring in 2003 and if not renewed could adversely impact sales of our credit marketing products and services we are also subject to privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in foreign countries where we do business notably the united kingdom’s data protection act of 1998 which became fully effective on october 24 2001 and which regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data and recent regulatory limitations relating to use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the united kingdom generally the data underlying the products offered by our information services and consumer direct product lines excluding our commercial services products are subject to these regulations 

the information underlying our commercial services and direct marketing services is less regulated than the other portions of our business where data relates to consumers or is credit based information underlying our commercial services business which relates to commercial enterprises is generally less regulated than information relating to individual consumers a significant portion of the information maintained by our marketing services business is voluntarily provided by individuals rendering it subject to fewer restrictions on use it is our policy however to treat all information with a high degree of security reflecting our recognition of individuals’ privacy concerns 

intellectual property 

we own and control a number of trade secrets and other confidential information trademarks service marks trade names copyrights patents and other proprietary and intellectual property rights that in the aggregate are of material importance to our business these rights include the “equifax “ name and related marks and logos and our proprietary data which we believe are individually of material importance to our business we consider these to be proprietary and we rely on a combination of copyright trademark and service mark patent trade secret nondisclosure and other contractual and intellectual property safeguards for protection we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations 

we are licensed to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others other than the licenses from fair isaac and company inc and seisint inc we do not consider these licenses to be material to our business we have a series of license agreements with fair isaac pursuant to which we obtain among other rights the right to use in our information services products several credit scoring algorithms and the right to sell scores derived from these algorithms these agreements have varying durations and generally provide for usagebased fees seisint inc has granted us a license to use certain software for our direct marketing services products this license facilitates our sale of marketing lists and other direct marketing services products a second license permits us to utilize this platform to support our credit marketing products both seisint licenses have a 10year term beginning in 2002 and may be renewed for yearly periods thereafter 

we license other companies to use certain data technology and other intellectual property rights that we own and control primarily as core components of our products and services on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards 

competition

year 2002 compared with 2001 

our reported revenues of 11 billion in 2002 decreased 3 from 2001 our adjusted revenues were even with 2002 in 2002 equifax north america accounted for 81 of our total revenue and 91 of our operating income before corporate expense our revenue growth in 2002 was negatively impacted by a global economy that has continued to weaken equifax north america revenues grew 6 in 2002 delivering an additional 498 million in revenue compared to 13 growth in 2001 our 2002 revenue growth is attributable to increases in revenues from our consumer direct products sales of mortgage services resulting from increased refinancing activity and our acquisition of naviant international revenues declined 451 million or 18 driven by currency fluctuations the decision to exit our commercial reporting business in spain and the decline of the argentinean economy the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies particularly in latin america negatively impacted consolidated revenue by 167 million or 2 

consolidated operating expenses in 2002 of 7580 million declined 1272 million or 14 over 2001 operating expense as adjusted decreased 1 or 93 million excluding incremental operating expense from our naviant acquisition operating expenses declined 5 driven by our continued focus on productivity improvements discretionary expense control and our restructuring actions taken in 2001 after the certegy spinoff in the fourth quarter of 2001 we reduced our worldwide workforce 11 to approximately 5200 employees and in 2002 continued to drive productivity resulting in an additional 5 decrease 

cost of services in 2002 of 4276 million declined 234 million or 5 the divestiture of our city directory business in october 2001 accounted for 93 million of the reduction as adjusted cost of services declined 3 driven by our 

decision to exit of our commercial credit reporting business in spain lower personnel expense and professional service fees partially offset with higher royalties and data purchases expense on higher unit volumes in equifax north america 

sga expenses of 2499 million declined nearly 7 over 2001 driven by the divestiture of city directory as adjusted sga expense increased 45 million or 2 due to our naviant acquisition our sga expense in 2002 was also negatively impacted by an increase of 43 million in bad debt expense with the worldcom bankruptcy representing the largest portion of such expense 

operating income in 2002 increased 38 to 3513 million with operating margins of 32 operating income as adjusted grew 3 driven by our focus on productivity and expense control equifax north america’s ability to maintain strong operating margins while investing in key growth initiatives and equifax europe’s improvement in margins from 4 to 10 in 2002 offset margin erosion in our marketing services operations in the us profit deterioration in equifax latin america due to economic conditions in argentina and the reduction in income from our former lottery business see “segment results – other” below 

year 2001 compared with 2000 

our reported revenues of 11 billion in 2001 decreased 4 or 502 million driven by our divestiture of several businesses see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2000 we sold the risk management collections business that we conducted in the united states canada and the united kingdom the vehicle information business that we conducted in the united kingdom and a direct marketing business that we conducted in canada on a combined basis these divested businesses including city directory which was sold in 2001 generated revenues of 1620 million and operating profit of 90 million with margins of 6 revenues as adjusted increased 8 over 2000 driven by equifax north america’s record 13 growth on strong credit reporting volumes and consumer direct revenue growth the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies particularly in latin america negatively impacted consolidated revenue by 269 million or 3 

consolidated operating expenses in 2001 of 8852 million including a 604 million restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter increased 46 million over 2000 operating expenses in 2001 as adjusted were 7673 compared to adjusted operating expenses of 7069 in 2000 the 604 million increase was driven by record volumes in our north american operations and 228 million of incremental operating expense added from our acquisition of the consumer information solutions group from rl polk  co in may 2000 and the november 2000 acquisition of two related italian businesses named sek srl and aif gruppo securitas srl the products and services of the consumer information solutions group that we acquired from rl polk  co which we had referred to as our consumer information services are now categorized within our marketing services product line and reported in our equifax north america segment 

cost of services in 2001 of 4510 million declined 622 million or 12 driven by the sale of our risk management collections business in the united states canada and the united kingdom our vehicle information business in the united kingdom and a direct marketing business in canada which are classified as divested operations partially offsetting this decline is a 433 million increase in production and data processing expenses due to record volumes in our equifax north america operations sga expenses of 2676 million increased 2 over 2000 driven by higher sales incentive payouts on record sales incremental expense from our acquisition of the consumer information solutions group from rl polk  co and growth in our consumer direct product line 

operating income in 2001 of 2538 million decreased 18 over 2000 driven by our 604 million restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 operating income as adjusted increased 7 over 2000 driven by strong revenue growth in equifax north america more than offsetting margin deterioration in our international operations 

other income expense net 

other income expense net principally consists of interest income gains and losses from divested businesses and gains and losses on foreign currency interest income in 2002 2001 and 2000 totaled 63 million 83 million and 79 million respectively included in other income expense net is the sale of our city directory business in october 2001 and our risk management collections business and vehicle information business in 2000 which generated pretax losses of 58 million and 42 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 66 million and 80 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively this reduction was driven by lower average debt outstanding and lower interest rates our total debt outstanding at december 31 2002 was 9245 million compared to 7556 million at december 31 2001 we expect interest expense to increase in 2003 due to higher outstanding debt levels 

effective tax rates 

our effective tax rates from continuing operations were 393 421 and 434 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively our lower effective rate in 2002 was driven by the elimination of goodwill amortization beginning january 1 2002 as required by sfas 142 the tax basis of goodwill related to the loss on sale of city directory in the third quarter of 2001 and the implementation of state tax planning strategies effective tax rate changes from 2000 to 2001 were mainly due to nondeductible goodwill associated with divestitures and changes in levels of foreign earnings 

segment results 

our segment results for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2002 are as follows 

 

 equifax north america 

in 2002 equifax north america generated 81 of our revenue and 91 of our operating profit before corporate expense this segment’s revenue increased 6 in 2002 the naviant acquisition included in marketing services positively impacted revenue growth 35 for the year we experienced positive momentum in the second half of the year as revenues grew 6 compared to a 1 decline in the first half excluding revenues from the naviant acquisition 

as shown in the following table our equifax north america segment includes revenues from our 

•   us consumer and commercial services which are comprised of the consumer and commercial services that we provide in the us which we previously referred to as us credit information services

  year 2002 compared with 2001 

us consumer and commercial services 2002 revenue growth was 1 over 2001 revenue growth in 2002 was challenging due to tough economic conditions in the us and a record 2001 base year revenues in the second half of 2002 grew 55 compared to a 3 decline in the first half of the year the momentum was driven by mortgage refinancing and market share gains principally in financial services average prices were flat year over year influenced by higher mortgage activity mortgage services delivered record revenues with 24 growth with continued economic weakness we expect to see low to mid single digit revenue growth percentages in 2003 mortgage loan originations a significant contributor to our credit reporting volume growth in 2002 and 2001 are expected to slow during 2003 

our marketing services product lines delivered 2748 million in revenues or 6 growth in 2002 driven by incremental revenues from our naviant acquisition revenues from our credit marketing services which include prescreening portfolio review database and other marketing products were down 1 for the year principally due to the economic conditions revenues from direct marketing services were 1105 million or 19 above the prior year driven by incremental revenues from our naviant acquisition our direct marketing services revenues continued to be negatively impacted by the slow down in spending for advertising mailings and promotions 

consumer direct services revenues grew 80 over the prior year all products continued strong growth including 66 million of incremental sales from the launch of our equifax 3in1 credit report we continue to expect strong revenue growth in 2003 

equifax north america delivered record profit of 3616 million with 6 growth over adjusted operating income on solid revenue growth and strong expense management we maintained operating margins of 40 as we continue to invest in growth initiatives such as our us small business credit report and our safety and security services 

year 2001 compared with 2000 

us consumer and commercial services delivered revenue growth of 14 in 2001 on a record credit reporting volume increase of 20 the key industry growth drivers were mortgage telecommunications financial services and automotive lower interest rates helped generate record volumes in mortgage refinancing cellular usage increased and automakers’ zero rate financing incentives which combined to drive consolidated volumes with consecutive quarterly growth in 2001 volume growth was partially offset by average unit price declines of 6 in 2001 mortgage services revenues grew 73 in 2001 caused by a favorable interest rate environment compared with a 21 decrease in 2000 canadian operations revenues increased 14 in 2001 on strong consumer credit volume growth 

our marketing services product lines generated combined revenues of 2594 million or almost even with 2598 million in 2000 revenues from our credit marketing services declined 6 in 2001 versus 2000 lower revenues in 2001 were principally due to product mix shifts to lower priced risk management products and price compression due to customer consolidation our 2001 revenues from direct marketing services were 929 million a 13 increase over 2000 excluding incremental revenues as a result of the may 2000 acquisition from rl polk  co revenues declined 11 principally driven by a significant slow down in advertising and marketing expenditures by our customers due to the slowing us economy 

consumer direct revenues in 2001 more than doubled to 219 million largely due to 97 million of incremental sales from the new scorepower® credit score product launched in march 2001 and increased sales of the equifax credit report tm credit report and equifax credit watch tm credit monitoring service consumer direct sales in 2000 totaled 78 million 

operating income for equifax north america increased 15 in 2001 on record revenue and volume growth excluding the impact of our may 2000 acquisition from rl polk operating income growth for 2001 was 16 

equifax europe year 2002 compared with 2001 

equifax europe which includes the results of our operations in the united kingdom spain portugal and italy and our support operations in ireland continued to improve its profit and operating margins through expense reductions and operating efficiencies and the decision to exit the commercial credit reporting business in spain revenues declined 14 on a local currency basis driven by our decision to exit the commercial credit reporting business in spain and lower revenues from our united kingdom operations our united kingdom operations generated 77 of equifax europe’s revenues in 2002 us dollar revenue benefited 54 million from the strengthening of local currencies british pound and the euro 

operating expenses in 2002 of 1134 million declined 16 united kingdom expenses decreased 11 driven by our fourth quarter 2001 restructuring plan focused on rightsizing our united kingdom operations and driving productivity during the third quarter of 2002 we made the decision to exit the commercial credit reporting business in spain due to local market conditions and this business is now held for sale see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for 2002 the results of the spanish commercial business have been classified as discontinued operations 2001 results were not material to our consolidated results and as such have not been reclassified to discontinued operations 

operating income of 127 million more than doubled over 2001 driven by united kingdom expense reductions we continue to focus on driving operational efficiencies in our european businesses and expect continued margin improvement in 2003 

year 2001 compared with 2000 

equifax europe achieved 2001 revenue growth of 3 in local currency our revenue growth was attributable to the november 2000 acquisition of two related italian businesses named sek srl and aif gruppo securitas srl the strengthening of the us dollar against the british pound and spanish peseta reduced our revenue in 2001 by approximately 60 million additionally we experienced revenue declines in our united kingdom and spain commercial credit reporting services 

operating income as adjusted in 2001 of 58 million declined 114 million from 2000 on lower revenues in the united kingdom and spain 

equifax latin america 

year 2002 compared with 2001 

revenues of our equifax latin america segment which includes results of our operations in brazil argentina chile peru uruguay and el salvador declined by 301 million or 28 from 2001 driven by currency devaluation and the economic crisis in argentina currency devaluation negatively impacted our latin america revenues by 218 million of which brazil and argentina accounted for 183 million argentina’s operating revenue and profit declined 218 million and 104 million respectively in local currency brazil’s revenues grew 8 in 2002 driven by performance in commercial reporting services 

operating income as adjusted declined 37 to 203 million compared to 2001 principally due to argentina’s economic decline despite the economic challenges equifax latin america delivered solid operating margins of 26 in 2002 versus 30 in 2001 

year 2001 compared with 2000 

equifax latin america generated revenue of 1067 million and operating margins of 30 in 2001 in local currency revenues increased three percent in 2001 the strengthening of the us dollar against the brazilian real and the chilean peso reduced this segment’s revenue by approximately 175 million in 2001 

operating income as adjusted in 2001 decreased 80 million mainly due to weak currencies and economic conditions in the region cost containment measures helped deliver strong margins of 30 in 2001 

other 

in our other segment we report information about our former lottery business which consists solely of an agreement between a subsidiary of ours and gtech corporation pursuant to this subcontract gtech assumed obligations of our subsidiary under a contract with the state of california to install a system to automate the processing of instant lottery tickets provide terminals and related security hardware and license various software applications developed to support the system we have exited the lottery business and all previously deferred revenue related to this subcontract has now been recognized and no further revenue or operating income is expected to occur in this segment 

general corporate 

general corporate expense increased 29 million in 2002 based on higher incentive compensation expense and onetime expenses associated with the hiring of senior executive management our 2001 expense increase of 31 million was driven by higher incentive compensation plan expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by our operating activities our revolving credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents 

we believe that our ability to generate cash from our operations is one of our fundamental financial strengths in 2002 we generated cash flow from operations of 2488 million our free cash flow the cash flow provided by our operating activities less capital expenditures was 1930 million in 2002 our capital expenditures are used for developing enhancing and deploying new and existing technology platforms replacing or adding equipment updating systems for regulatory compliance the licensing of software applications and investing in disaster recovery systems we use free cash flow along with borrowings to make acquisitions to retire outstanding indebtedness to pay dividends and to make share repurchases 

cash from operations 

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was 2488 million compared to 2551 million in 2001 increased cash flows generated from lower trade receivable balances were offset by payments associated with our fourth quarter restructuring plan in 2001 ongoing data purchases and a 200 million contribution to our us defined benefit pension plan our operating cash flow continues to be driven by operating margin performance and aggressive working capital management days sales outstanding declined from 63 days in 2001 to 55 days in 2002 

cash provided by operations in 2001 amounted to 2551 million an increase of 32 from 2000 the improvement over 2000 was largely influenced by three factors higher operating income aggressive working capital management of receivables and a 248 million reduction in capital expenditures 

investing activities 

in 2002 net cash used in investing activities totaled 3410 million an increase of 2345 million compared to 2001 the increase was primarily a result of our acquisition of naviant and acquisition of assets from cbc our acquisitions net of cash acquired accounted for 3212 million of total cash invested in 2002 capital expenditures exclusive of acquisitions totaled 558 million which principally represented development associated with key technology platforms in our businesses we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of 2000 million in 2003 with capital expenditures expected to range from 450 to 550 million 

in the third quarter of 2002 our 410 million note receivable associated with the sale of our risk management collections business in 2000 was completely paid 

in 2001 net cash used in investing activities totaled 1065 million a decrease of 1565 million compared to 2000 the decrease was primarily the result of the fact that we were less acquisitive in 2001 focusing on our spinoff of certegy capital expenditures exclusive of acquisitions and investments amounted to 471 million in 2001 compared to 719 million in 2000 acquisitions and investments net of cash acquired declined from 3468 million in 2000 to 687 million in 2001 largely due to our acquisition of the consumer information solutions group from rl polk  co in may 2000 these amounts were offset by cash proceeds generated from the sale of businesses and other assets which amounted to 124 million in 2001 and 1575 million in 2000 and are principally associated with the sale of our city directory business in 2001 and the sale of our risk management collections and vehicle information businesses in 2000 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during 2002 totaled 926 million compared with net cash used in financing activities during 2001 that totaled 3255 million and net cash provided by financing activities during 2000 that totaled 164 million 

in 2002 we received 2495 million in proceeds from the sale of 2500 million aggregate principal amount of our 495 senior unsecured notes which mature november 1 2007 during 2002 we invested 798 million to repurchase 29 million shares of our common stock and received 342 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options at december 31 2001 our remaining authorization for share repurchases was approximately 450 million and in february 2002 our 

board of directors approved an additional 2500 million for share repurchases we also continued our 90year history of paying dividends which totaled 114 million in 2002 

in 2001 we reduced our longterm debt 2989 million through the repayment of borrowings under our 4650 million revolving credit facility debt repayments were funded through operating cash flows and the cash dividend received from certegy in conjunction with the spinoff during 2001 we invested 423 million to repurchase 22 million shares of our common stock up from 65 million invested to repurchase shares in 2000 and we received 364 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options share repurchases were temporarily suspended in 2000 to enable us to apply available cash to the repayment of debt incurred in connection with our acquisition of the consumer information services group from rl polk  co in may 2000 in 2001 our payment of dividends totaled 323 million a decrease of 200 million compared to 2000 due to a reduction of our quarterly dividend after the certegy spinoff from 0093 to 002 per share 

we expect to increase the amount outstanding under our 4650 million credit facility in 2003 for purposes of retiring the 2000 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 65 senior unsecured notes that mature in june 2003 

cash and cash equivalents 

our cash and cash equivalents balance was 305 million and 332 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively 

revolving credit facilities 

our 4650 million revolving credit facility which we entered into with bank of america na and certain other lenders on october 4 2001 provides for a variable interest rate tied to base rate libor and competitive bid options the weighted average interest rate of borrowings outstanding under this facility was approximately 26 as of december 31 2002 the credit facility consists of a 1600 million 364day portion and a 3050 million multiyear portion which expire on october 2 2003 and october 4 2004 respectively the agreement governing this facility contains various covenants and restrictions including among other things limitations on liens subsidiary debt mergers liquidation asset dispositions acquisitions and maintenance of certain financial covenants our borrowings under this facility which have not been guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries are unsecured and will rank on parity in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding as of december 31 2002 we had 4432 million of borrowing capacity available under our 4650 million revolving credit facility 

one of our canadian subsidiaries has an unsecured 364day c1000 million revolving credit facility that will expire in october 2003 the agreement provides for borrowings tied to prime base rate libor and canadian bankers’ acceptances and contains financial covenants related to interest coverage funded debt to cash flow and limitations on subsidiary indebtedness we have guaranteed the indebtedness of our canadian subsidiary under this facility as of december 31 2002 us 343 million of borrowing capacity was available under this credit facility 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2002 

 

 we believe that future cash flows provided by our operating activities together with current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter although any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty for instance computer sciences corporation has an option exercisable at any time prior to 2013 to sell its credit reporting business to us the option exercise price will be determined by a thirdparty appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if csc were to exercise the option today the option 

price would be approximately 6500 to 7000 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the business current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change if csc were to exercise its option we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt andor equity however the availability and terms of any such financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the state of the equity markets general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition because we do not control the timing of csc’s exercise of its option we could be required to seek such financing and increase our indebtedness at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable see “risk factors” below 

we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities from lenders and restructure our longterm debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services and technologies and the repurchase and retirement of debt which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 

off balance sheet transactions 

other than facility leasing arrangements we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities we have entered into a synthetic lease on our atlanta corporate headquarters building in order to provide us with favorable financing terms with regard to this facility this 290 million lease was entered into in 1998 and expires in 2010 total lease payments for the remaining term total 135 million under this synthetic lease arrangement we have also guaranteed the residual value of the leased property to a lessor in the event that the property were to be sold by the lessor at the end of the lease term we would be responsible for any shortfall of the sales proceeds up to a maximum amount of 232 million which equals 80 percent of the value of the property at the beginning of the lease term we believe that the fair market value of this property exceeds the amount of the guarantee 

letters of credit and guarantees 

we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of our business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit is less than 150 million and they all have a maturity of one year or less we provide these guarantees from time to time to support the needs of our operating units except for our guarantee of the synthetic lease referred to above our only outstanding guarantee that is not reflected as a liability on our balance sheet was extended in connection with the sale of our risk management collections business to rma holdings llc or rma in october 2000 at which time we guaranteed the operating lease payments of a partnership affiliated with rma to a lender of the partnership pursuant to a term loan the term loan which had 79 million outstanding as of december 31 2002 expires december 1 2011 our obligations under the rma guarantee are not secured we believe that the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expect no material losses to occur in connection with these instruments 

subsidiary funds transfer limitations 

the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds is limited in some cases by foreign government regulations at december 31 2002 the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries was not material 

pension benefits 

during 2002 actual asset returns for our us defined benefit pension plan were adversely impacted by the performance of the us stock market resulting in a decrease in the market value of our retirement plan assets the fair value of our defined benefit pension plan assets decreased from 4131 million at december 31 2001 to 3448 million at december 31 2002 in addition we lowered our discount rate from 725 to 675 which increased our us projected benefit obligations from 4190 million to 4512 million the negative investment performance and declining discount rates during 2002 created an unfunded status in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “sfas 87” at december 31 2002 as required under sfas 87 a noncash minimum pension liability of 1794 million 1124 million after tax reducing shareholders’ equity was recorded at december 31 2002 the impact of our plan’s funded status would be reversed and shareholder’s equity consequently restored on december 31 of any year in which the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation as of that date further this adjustment had no impact on our income statement and did not affect cash flow or our compliance with any financial covenants contained in any of our debt agreements 

we continually monitor and evaluate the level of pension contributions based on various factors that include but are not limited to investment performance actuarial valuation and tax deductibility while the asset return and interest rate environment have negatively impacted the funded status of our us defined benefit pension plan under sfas 87 our minimum funding requirements as set forth in the employment retirement income security act erisa and federal tax laws have been zero for the past five years in addition we expect no mandatory funding requirements in 2003 or 2004 although no minimum funding was required at our discretion we contributed 200 million to our us defined benefit pension plan in 2002 

our us defined benefit pension plan delivered pension income of 110 million in 2002 and approximately 86 million in 2001 the annual pension income is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions including the expected longterm rate of return on assets and a discount rate in determining the expected longterm rate of return on assets we evaluate input from our investment consultants investment management firms and actuaries additionally we consider our historical 15year compounded returns which have been in excess of our forwardlooking return expectations the expected longterm rate of return on this basis for 2002 was 95 for determination of 2003 pension expense the long termrate of return will be reduced to 875 we believe that 875 is a reasonable longterm rate of return on assets despite the recent market downturn in which our plan assets had a return loss of approximately 128 for the year ended december 31 2002 

our determination of pension income and expense is based on a market related valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this market related valuation of assets recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains and losses for this purpose are the difference between expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on the market related value of assets since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized our us cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses at december 31 2002 were 2020 million these unrecognized losses will result in a decrease in our future pension income depending on several factors including their relative size to our projected benefit obligation and market related value of plan assets 

the discount rate we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on the yield associated with moody’s longterm aarated corporate bond index the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 725 at december 31 2001 to 675 at december 31 2002 

inflation 

we do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on our operating results however inflation could adversely affect our future operating results if it were to result in a substantial weakening in economic conditions 

recent accounting pronouncements in january 2002 we adopted sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the statement supersedes sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” but retains the fundamental provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of longlived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations the statement also supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 30 apb 30 for the disposal of a segment of business extending the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” further the statement requires operating losses from a “component of an entity” to be recognized in the periods in which they occur rather than at the measurement date as had been required under apb 30 

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” sfas no 145 amends sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to eliminate inconsistency between the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to saleleaseback transactions sfas no 145 also rescinds sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” accordingly gains or losses from extinguishment of debt shall not be reported as extraordinary items unless the extinguishment qualifies as an extraordinary item under the criteria apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations—reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” sfas no 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002 we adopted sfas no 145 on january 1 2003 

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 provides guidance related to accounting for costs associated with disposal activities covered by sfas no 144 or with exit or restructuring activities previously covered by emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” sfas no 146 supercedes eitf issue no 943 in its entirety sfas no 146 requires that costs related to exiting an activity or to a restructuring not be recognized until the liability 

is incurred sfas no 146 will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 we adopted sfas no 146 on january 1 2003 

in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 “fin 45” “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 currently requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor’s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee in addition as of december 31 2002 fin 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued including a rollforward of the entity’s product warranty liabilities we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin 45 effective december 31 2002 and the remaining provisions on january 1 2003 and have included the required disclosures in the notes to the 2002 consolidated financial statements 

in november 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 0021 “revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” eitf issue no 0021 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets the provisions of eitf issue no 0021 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation transition and disclosure” sfas no 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stock based compensation” to currently require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stockbased employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements sfas no 148 does not amend sfas no 123 to require companies to account for their employee stockbased awards using the fair value method however the disclosure provisions are required for all companies with stockbased employee compensation regardless of whether they utilize the fair value method of accounting described in sfas no 123 or the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” we adopted sfas no 148 on january 1 2003 and have included the initial required disclosures in the notes to the 2002 consolidated financial statements 

in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” fin 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2003 we are evaluating the impact of fin 46 on our financial position and results of operations

 application of critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the following accounting policies involve a “critical accounting estimate” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item 8 of part ii notes to consolidated financial statements note 1— significant accounting and reporting policies although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the following four conditions are met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the price is fixed or determinable and 4 collectibility of the selling price is reasonably assured for sales contracts having multiple elements that can be divided into separate units of accounting we allocate revenue to these separate units based on their relative fair values if relative fair values cannot be established revenue recognition is deferred until all elements under the contract have been delivered multiple deliverable arrangements generally involve delivery of multiple product lines these product lines are distinct enough to be separated into separate units of accounting each product line does not impact the value or usage of other deliverables in the arrangement and each can be sold alone or purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the remaining deliverables delivery of product lines generally occurs consistently over the contract period 

in conjunction with certain products and services we charge nonrefundable setup fees which we recognize on a prorata basis over the term of the contract revenue from the sale of decision or statistical models is recognized upon customer installation and acceptance for certain products and services sold on a subscription basis we recognize revenue pro rata over the term of the contract we consider revenue recognition to be critical to all of our operating segments due to the impact on our results of operations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us we record a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected for all other accounts receivable we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on our past writeoff experience ie average percentage of receivables written off historically and the length of time the receivables are past due allowances for doubtful accounts were approximately 173 million or 9 of the accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2002 accounts receivable net of allowances was approximately 1798 million or 63 of total current assets in our consolidated balance sheet of december 31 2002 we consider accounting for accounts receivable allowances critical to all of our operating segments because of the significance of accounts receivable to our current assets and operating cash flow if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if economic conditions worsened additional allowances may be required in the future which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements we reassess our allowance for 

doubtful accounts each period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or expense recognized could result 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets 

goodwill and certain other intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas 142 and all other longlived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets we regularly evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of longlived assets principally goodwill purchased data files systems development and other deferred costs and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries may be impaired or not recoverable the significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategy market conditions or the manner of use of an asset underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends in evaluating an asset for possible impairment management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations in 2001 the fasb issued statement no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which among other things eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that goodwill be evaluated annually for impairment by applying a fair valuebased test we adopted the standard effective january 1 2002 for acquisitions prior to june 30 2001 and in accordance with the standard completed our first fair valuebased impairment tests by june 30 2002 

legal contingencies 

we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business our consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on our management’s view of the expected outcome we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be estimated we accrue a liability for estimated legal fees and settlements in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations a valuation allowance is currently set against deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 

retirement plans 

our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” our pension and postretirement benefit liabilities were approximately 1170 million or 9 of the total liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2002 we consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because our management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates health care cost trends rates salary growth longterm return on plan assets and mortality rates depending on the assumptions and estimates used the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

risk factors 

since our revenues depend to a large extent on our customers’ demand for consumer credit information further deterioration of current economic conditions or rising interest rates may harm our results of operations 

consumer credit reports constitute our core product in general our customers use our credit reports and related services to process applications for new credit cards automobile loans home mortgages and refinancing and other consumer loans they also use our credit reports and services to monitor existing credit relationships consumer demand for credit ie rates of spending and levels of indebtedness tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth rising rates of interest may also negatively impact consumer demand for credit especially mortgage loan refinancing a decline in consumer demand for credit reduces our customers’ demand for our consumer credit reports consequently our revenues from consumer credit report products and services could be negatively affected and our results of operations harmed if the current economic downturn intensifies or persists if consumer demand for credit decreases or if interest rates increase 

general economic conditions could continue to result in decreased demand for our marketing products and services which could harm our results of operations 

as a result of the current economic climate we are experiencing a reduction in the demand for the marketing products and services that we provide to our financial catalog publishing hightech travel and manufacturing clients as they have looked for ways to reduce their expenses the current economic slowdown could persist for an unpredictable period or may worsen and if our clients react by reducing their marketing budgets our results of operations could be adversely affected additionally if consumers buy fewer of the types of products and services that in the past have been marketed and sold through direct marketing or if direct marketing loses effectiveness in comparison to other methods of advertising demand for our marketing products and services could lessen and consequently our revenues and profits from this line of business could decline 

the loss of access to credit and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services 

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers and various government and public record services our data sources could withdraw their data from us for a variety of reasons including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use if a substantial number of data sources were to withdraw their data or we lost access to data due to government regulation our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted which could result in decreased revenues net income and earnings per share 

changes in the legislative regulatory and judicial environments may adversely affect our ability to collect manage aggregate and use data 

our business involves collection of consumer and business data and distribution of such information to businesses making credit and marketing decisions consequently certain of our activities and services are subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities in the united states and canada and in those countries within europe and latin america where we do business for instance much of the data and services that we provide are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act fcra which regulates the use of consumer credit information and to a lesser extent the grammleachbliley act which regulates the use of nonpublic personal information portions of the fcra relating to prescreen service are expiring this year and their nonrenewal could adversely impact our credit marketing services products we are also subject to the united kingdom’s data protection act of 1998 which became fully effective on october 24 2001 and regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data and recent regulatory limitations relating to use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the united kingdom in addition there is increasing awareness and public concern about individual privacy rights and the collection distribution and use of information about individuals this concern may result in the adoption of new federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that could include increased compliance requirements and restrictions on the purchase sale and sharing of information about consumers for commercial purposes and have a negative impact on our ability to collect such information provided by consumers voluntarily future international federal state and local laws and regulations with respect to the collection management and use of data about individuals and adverse publicity judicial interpretations or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may result in substantial regulatory compliance costs litigation expense or a loss of revenue 

 

our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our gross margins 

we operate in a number of geographic product and service markets that are highly competitive in consumer credit reporting services we compete primarily with two global consumer credit reporting companies experian information solutions inc and trans union llc we also compete with these and other companies including acxiom corporation hartehanks inc and infousa inc with respect to our direct marketing services we cannot assure you that competitors will not develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services 

the sizes of our competitors vary across market segments as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target therefore some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing or other resources than we do in each of our market segments or overall as a result our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may devote greater resources than we can to the development promotion sale and support of products and services moreover new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share for instance we may face competition from new entrants to the business and consumer marketing information industry as a result of the rapid expansion of the internet which is a substantial new channel for distributing consumer and business information to the market if we are unable to respond as quickly or effectively to changes in customer requirements as our competition our ability to expand our business and sell our products and services will be negatively affected 

some of our competitors may also be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data technical superiority or economies of scale price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new commercial relationships on favorable terms 

our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services and if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services our revenues may decline 

to increase our revenues we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development we cannot assure you that the marketplace will accept these products if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services our ability to increase revenues will be impaired 

if we fail to keep up with rapidly changing technologies our products and services could become less competitive or obsolete 

in our markets technology changes rapidly and there are continuous improvements in computer hardware network operating systems programming tools programming languages operating systems database technology and the use of the internet advances in technology may result in changing customer preferences for products and services and delivery formats if we fail to enhance our current products and develop new products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer preferences our products and services could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete our future success will depend in part upon our ability to internally develop new and competitive technologies use leading thirdparty technologies effectively continue to develop our technical expertise anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 

we may suffer adverse financial consequences if computer sciences corporation requires us to purchase its credit reporting business when the public equity or debt markets or other financing conditions are unfavorable to us 

in 1988 we entered into an agreement with computer sciences corporation and certain of its affiliates which are collectively referred to in this document as csc under which csc’s credit reporting agencies utilize our 

computerized credit database services under the agreement csc has an option exercisable at any time to sell its credit reporting business to us the option expires in 2013 the option exercise price will be determined by a thirdparty appraisal process and would be due in cash within 180 days after the exercise of the option we estimate that if csc were to exercise the option today the option price would be approximately 6500 to 7000 million this estimate is based solely on our internal analysis of the value of the businesses current market conditions and other factors all of which are subject to constant change therefore the actual option exercise price could be materially higher or lower than the estimated amount if csc were to exercise its option we would have to obtain additional sources of funding we believe that this funding would be available from sources such as additional bank lines of credit and the issuance of public debt andor equity however the availability and terms of any such capital financing would be subject to a number of factors including credit market conditions the state of the equity markets general economic conditions and our financial performance and condition because we do not control the timing of csc’s exercise of its option we could be required to seek such financing and increase our debt levels at a time when market or other conditions are unfavorable 

our international operations subject us to additional business risks that may reduce our profitability or revenues 

we conduct business outside of the united states during the fiscal year ended december 31 2002 we received approximately 19 of our revenues from business outside the united states as part of our growth strategy we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the united states as a result our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control the risks and potential costs of our international operations include political and economic instability changes in regulatory requirements and policy and the adoption of laws detrimental to our operations such as legislation relating to the collection and use of personal data negative impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences increased restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and general economic conditions in international markets we may not be able to avoid significant expenditures in addressing these potential risks 

security is important to our business and breaches of security or the perception that ecommerce is not secure could harm our business 

businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer electronic commerce including that which is internetbased requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks several of our products are accessed through the internet including our consumer and commercial information services that are delivered via eport tm  our internet delivery channel and our consumer direct services accessible through the wwwequifaxcom website security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services via eport tm  our consumer direct website or wellpublicized security breaches not involving the internet that may affect us or our industry such as database intrusion could be detrimental to our business operating results and financial condition we cannot be certain that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our products consumer services and proprietary database information 

if we experience system failures the delivery of our products and services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems and data centers any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry and computer viruses the steps we have taken to prevent a system failure may not be successful and our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur 

since the agreement governing our variable and fixed rate indebtedness include crossdefault provisions a breach of a covenant related to some of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of some of all of other indebtedness 

our 4650 million revolving credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants related to interest coverage funded debt to cash flow and limitations on subsidiary indebtedness in addition to our revolving credit facility the indentures relating to our 2500 million 495 senior unsecured notes due 2007 2500 million 63 senior unsecured notes due 2005 2000 million 65 senior unsecured notes due 2003 and 1500 million 69 senior unsecured debentures due 2028 the c1000 million credit facility of our canadian subsidiary and our 290 million synthetic lease arrangement with respect to our headquarters in atlanta have affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of those types a default under any one of the instruments governing the foregoing indebtedness that results in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the underlying indebtedness is likely to constitute an event of default under each of the other instruments governing the foregoing indebtedness which could result in an acceleration of some of all of our other indebtedness if some of all of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay such indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if we are able to obtain new financing it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us if our expectations of future operating results are not achieved or if some or all of our indebtedness is in default for any reason our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses 

 

we have made in the past and may make in the future acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products services and technologies any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses such risks include 

•   the possibility that we will pay more than the acquired companies or assets are worth 

•   the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses 

•   the potential product liability associated with the sale of the acquired companies’ products 

•   the potential disruption of our ongoing business 

•   the potential dilution of our existing stockholders and earning per share 

•   unanticipated liabilities legal risks and costs the distraction of management from our ongoing business and 

•   the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of integration of new management personnel 

these factors could harm our business results of operations or financial position particularly in the event of a significant acquisition 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

in the normal course of our business we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain of these exposures we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in u s dollars however we do transact business in other currencies primarily the british pound the euro the canadian dollar and the brazilian real for most of these foreign currencies we are a net recipient and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 

we are required to translate or express in us dollars the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable yearend rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheet and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year we record the resulting translation adjustment and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature as components of our shareholders’ equity other immaterial foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of income we do not as a matter of policy hedge translational foreign currency exposure we will however hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with material transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency 

at december 31 2002 we have hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with the acquisition of our italian businesses in the fourth quarter of 2000 by borrowing under our 4650 million revolving credit facility in euros at december 31 2002 the foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with loans which funded the acquisition of our italian businesses during the fourth quarter of 2000 were hedged by denominating a portion of the borrowings under our 4650 million revolving credit facility in euros 

at december 31 2002 a 10 weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during 2002 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues by 278 million and an increase of our pretax operating profit by 64 million a 10 stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenues and pretax operating profit 

 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our variable rate revolving credit debt and the interest rate swap agreements associated with portions of our fixed rate public debt 

we attempt to achieve the lowest allin weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt at december 31 2002 our weighted average cost of debt was 51 and the weighted average life of our debt was 58 years 

we generally target a mix of fixed and floating rate debt which lies within a range of 3070 fixed with the balance being floating rate at december 31 2002 66 of our debt was fixed rate and the remaining 34 floating rate we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps as of 12  31 02 we had 2790 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements outstanding with bank counterparties 

our variable rate indebtedness consists primarily of our 4650 million revolving credit facility and a separate c1000 million revolving credit facility in canada the rate of interest we pay on our 4650 million facility is based on a floating rate pricing grid tied to our longterm senior unsecured debt rating we are currently rated a by standard  poor’s and baa1 by moody’s investor service in the case of a split rating pricing is based on the higher rating ie a from sp we can borrow under the facility at floating rates of interest tied to base rate and the london interbank offered rate or libor a competitive bid option is also available dependent on liquidity in the bank market at december 31 2002 218 million of debt was outstanding and 4432 million of additional borrowing capacity was available under this facility borrowings under our canadian facility bear interest at a floating rate tied to prime libor  or canadian banker’s acceptances as of december 31 2002 c460 million us293 million of debt was outstanding and c540 million us343 million of additional borrowing capacity was available under our canadian facility 

we have interest rate swap agreements in place to float the interest rate on 2500 million of our fixed rate 63 senior unsecured notes through their maturity date in 2005 these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges were documented as fully effective under sfas 133 and were valued on a mark to market basis as an asset totaling 183 million at december 31 2002 the offsetting liability of 183 million is included as an addition to longterm debt these swaps give us the right to receive fixed rate payments from the counterparties in exchange for floating rate payments from us the floating rate payments on these interest rate swaps are tied to 6month libor plus a spread with net settlements paid semiannually the final maturity of these interest rate swaps is july 2005 coinciding with the final maturity of the associated notes 

we also have a 290 million floatingtofixed interest rate swap maturing 2010 which fixes the effective rate of interest on the 290 million synthetic lease for our atlanta corporate headquarters this derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge was documented as fully effective under sfas 133 and was valued on a marktomarket basis as a liability totaling 47 million at december 31 2002 this interest rate swap gives us the right to receive a floating rate payment tied to 3month libor plus a spread from the counterparty in exchange for a fixed rate payment from us the net settlements occur quarterly 

a 1 increase in the average rate of interest on the variable rate debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities during 2002 would have increased our pretax interest expense by 20 million 

a 1 increase in the average rate of interest associated with the floating rate payments due under our interest rate swap agreements during 2002 would have increased our pretax interest expense by 25 million since all of our interest rate swaps are fully effective our income statement is unaffected by the noncash quarterly marktomarket adjustments associated with these derivatives 




 item 9   changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

on march 28 2002 our board of directors upon recommendation of its audit committee dismissed arthur andersen llp as our independent public accountants and engaged ernst  young llp to serve as our independent auditors for the year ended december 31 2002 for more information see our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on april 3 2002 and the information reported in our current report on form 8ka filed with the sec on april 9 2002

item 7           managements discussion and analysis
                  of financial condition and results of operations

overview

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the companys
results the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes

worldwide the company provides to a wide range of customers information
management consumer credit information marketing business information and
identity verification services to enable credit and business decisions the
company through its consumer direct business provides credit reporting and
identity theft monitoring services direct to consumers enabling them to
proactively manage their credit health and safeguard against identity theft the
company is the market leader for credit information services in north america

equifax incs 2001 financial reporting was significantly impacted by the
spinoff of its payment services business certegy divestitures of noncore
businesses divested operations and restructuring and other charges recorded
in the fourth quarter of 2001 excluding these transactions equifax reported
record revenues earnings and cash flow for its core business largely
attributable to performance in its north american information services
businesses significant 2001 financial highlights were

    consolidated revenues increased 8 to 11 billion
    diluted earnings per share increased 5 to 115 before restructuring
     and other charges of 60 million pretax
    consolidated operating margins were 29
    north american revenues increased 13 and operating income increased 14
    us consumer reporting volumes grew 20
    the consumer direct business more than tripled revenues
    free cash flow grew to 208 million a 72 increase over 2000

significant transactions

on july 7 2001 equifax completed the spinoff of certegy into a separate
publicly traded company the spinoff permitted both companies to focus on
growth in their core businesses with dedicated resources and the continued
creation of shareholder value as a result of the spinoff the companys
financial statements have been prepared with certegys net assets results of
operations and cash flows classified as discontinued operations with all
historical financial statements restated to conform to this presentation

in october 2001 the company divested its city directory business and in the
fourth quarter of 2000 sold its global risk management and uk vehicle
information businesses combined revenues for these businesses in 2001 and 2000
were 29 million and 162 million respectively with a 2001 operating loss of
36 million and 2000 operating income of 90 million the operating results of
these businesses are classified in divested operations for segment reporting
purposes

in the fourth quarter of 2001 restructuring and other charges were recorded in
connection with efforts to properly size and configure our postspin business
and to align our cost structure in our international operations the charge
totaled 60 million 35 million after tax or 025 per diluted share and
consisted of approximately 37 million for employee severance and facilities
consolidation and 23 million to write down several technology investments

management believes the core business results are more useful in analyzing the
underlying business by providing a consistent comparison of the companys
historical operating performance adjustments to reconcile the as reported
results for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2001 to the
core business results and the associated impact on diluted earnings per share
are as follows

   exclude the operating results and disposition gains and losses of divested
    operations
   exclude the 2001 restructuring and other charges
   adjust other income and interest expense to reflect the impact of the
    proceeds from divested operations
   adjust the effective income tax rate which reflects the above adjustments

see exhibit 998 to this report for a more detailed analysis of the reconciling
adjustments for core business results of operations

the following discussion of revenue operating income and segment results is on
a core business basis as previously described the discussion of other income
expense net interest expense and effective tax rates is on an as reported
basis

revenue

     revenues of 11 billion in 2001 increased 8 over 2000 driven by our
north american information services segments record consumer credit reporting
volumes and growth in our consumer direct business in 2001 north america
accounted for 77 of the companys total revenue and 90 of the operating income
before corporate expense revenue growth in north america was 13 the
strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies particularly in
latin america negatively impacted revenue 27 million or 3 incremental
revenues from our acquisitions in 2000 positively impacted revenue growth
approximately 4

    revenues of 10 billion in 2000 increased 12 over 1999 revenue growth was
significantly influenced by the may 2000 acquisition of our direct marketing
services business formerly the consumer information solutions group cis
from rl polk  co excluding the impact of the cis acquisition revenue growth
was 3 the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies during
2000 particularly the british pound and spanish peseta reduced 2000 revenue by
approximately 15 million or 2

operating income

     operating income in 2001 increased 6 to 3178 million on operating
margins of 29 north americas operating income growth of 14 and 40 basis
point margin improvement driven by consumer reporting and consumer direct offset
margin deterioration in our international operations particularly in europe

     operating income in 2000 grew 12 to 2996 million with operating margins
of 29 excluding the cis acquisition profit growth was 7 operating income
growth in our traditional us credit marketing services business canadas
consumer reporting business and improved operating expenses drove 2000
performance

other income expense net

     other income expense net includes interest income on cash balances of
32 million in 2001 75 million in 2000 and 58 million in 1999 lower cash
balances in foreign operations combined with lower interest rates accounted for
the decline in 2001 other income expense net in 2001 and 2000 includes
losses associated with the disposition of divested operations in october 2001
the company sold its city directory business which generated a pretax loss of
58 million the sale of the risk management and vehicle information businesses
generated pretax losses of 42 million in 2000 in 1999 the company sold
three risk management offices located in the us that resulted in a pretax
gain of 41 million

interest expense

     interest expense decreased 80 million in 2001 and increased 136 million
in 2000 as compared with prior years the decrease in 2001 from 2000 was due to
lower average debt outstanding and lower effective borrowing rates the increase
in 2000 resulted from higher average debt outstanding associated with 2000
acquisition activity and 1999 treasury stock purchases after adjusting for the
275 million debt reduction related to the spinoff of certegy average total
debt outstanding was 7754 million in 2001 8248 million in 2000 and 6990
million in 1999

effective tax rates

     the effective tax rates from continuing operations were 421 434 and
403 in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively changes in the levels of
nondeductible goodwill associated with divestitures and in the levels of
foreign earnings accounted for the changes in effective tax rates between
periods the effective rate in 2002 is expected to decline to approximately 40
due to the elimination of goodwill amortization and the effects of tax planning
strategies

segment results

the following table summarizes the segment results for each of the three years
in the period ended december 31 2001 the results of businesses sold in october
2001 and in the fourth quarter of 2000 are classified as divested operations

north american information services

     north american information services accounted for 8524 million or 77 of
the companys revenues in 2001 and 3275 million or 90 of the operating
income before corporate expense this segment includes us credit information
services mortgage services credit marketing services direct marketing
services canadian operations and consumer direct segment revenues increased
13 in 2001 and 19 in 2000 excluding the impact of the may 2000 cis
acquisition north americas revenue increased 8 in 2001 and 6 in 2000

     us credit information services 2001 revenue increased 13 compared to 1
growth in 2000 with 2001 growth driven by a record credit reporting volume
increase of 20 the key industry growth drivers were mortgage
telecommunications financial services and automotive lower interest rates
helped generate record volumes in mortgage refinancing cellular usage
increased and automakers zero rate financing incentives drove consolidated
volumes with consecutive quarterly growth in 2001 in 2000 volumes increased
11 volume growth was partially offset by average unit price declines of 6 in
2001 and 9 in 2000 average pricing is impacted by mix of business with many
of our large customers driving increased volumes at lower average unit prices
us credit information services compounded annual volume growth since 1990 is
approximately 13 in 2002 we expect volume growth to return to levels more
indicative of historical performance canadian revenue increased 14 in 2001 on
strong consumer credit volume growth compared to almost flat growth in 2000

     during 2001 increasing demand for information from mortgage industry
customers caused by a declining interest rate environment resulted in 73
growth in mortgage services revenue to 444 million compared with a 21
decrease in 2000 in 2002 we expect this business to decline from 2001 levels
as refinancing activity moderates

     our credit marketing services and direct marketing services businesses
generated combined revenue of 2593 million or 2 growth compared to 2536
million in 2000 excluding the direct marketing services incremental revenues of
332 million from the may 2000 acquisition 2001 revenues declined 11 largely
due to the economic impact of companies reducing advertising and marketing
expenditures in credit marketing services which includes prescreening
portfolio review database and other marketing products 2001 revenues declined
6 versus a 2000 record year of 28 growth lower revenues in 2001 were
principally due to product mix shifts to lower priced risk management products
some price compression due to customer consolidation and fewer marketing
campaigns our direct marketing services business experienced a 22 sales
decline in comparable sales in 2001 versus 2000 principally driven by a
significant contraction in advertising and marketing expenditures by its
customers due to the slowing us economy

     consumer direct more than tripled revenues to 219 million in 2001 largely
due to 10 million of incremental sales from the new scorepowertm credit score
product launched in march 2001 and increased sales of the equifax credit
profiler credit report and equifax credit watchtm credit monitoring

operating margins were 38 in 2001 and 2000 compared to 41 in 1999 lower

equifax europe

     revenue in equifax europe which consists of operations in the united
kingdom ireland spain portugal and italy grew 3 and 4 in 2001 and 2000
respectively on a local currency basis the local currency growth in 2001 is
attributable to the november 2000 acquisition of sek in italy the strengthening
of the us dollar against the british pound and spanish peseta reduced equifax
europes revenue by approximately 60 million in 2001 and 125 million in
2000

    operating income in 2001 of 18 million declined 119 million from 2000 on
lower revenues in the united kingdom and spain primarily due to slower economic
growth in 2000 operating income improved 90 million over 1999 substantially
driven by expense reductions we continue to focus on driving operational
efficiencies in our european businesses and expect improved margins in 2002

margin of 23 in 2001 the company has operations in brazil argentina chile
peru uruguay and el salvador in local currency revenues increased 3 in 2001

currencies and economic conditions in the region compared to a 27 million
increase in 2000 cost containment measures have helped stabilize and maintain
attractive margins of 23 in 2001 and 26 in 2000

    this segments operating results will be adversely affected in 2002 by the
recent economic events in argentina these events have impacted both the
conversion rates of the argentine peso to the us dollar and also the general
business conditions in argentina 2001 revenue and operating income for our
business in argentina totaled 260 million and 91 million respectively and
the companys investment in that business totaled approximately 26 million at
december 31 2001

2002 relating to the companys lottery subsidiary revenue and operating income
remained comparable at 96 million and 89 million respectively in all
periods

general corporate

    general corporate expense in 2001 increased 31 million on higher incentive
plan expense and increased 57 million in 2000 primarily due to higher
technology costs and onetime expenses associated with our headquarters
relocation

financial condition

     cash provided by operations increased 32 to 2551 million in 2001 and
free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures increased 72 to
208 million the improvement over 2000 was largely influenced by higher
operating income from core businesses aggressive management of receivables
days sales outstanding declined from 75 days in 2000 to 63 days in 2001 and a
248 million reduction in capital expenditures cash provided by operations in
2000 was 1928 million operating cash flow has been sufficient to fund capital
expenditures dividend payments and scheduled maturities of longterm debt

     during 2001 the companys cash used in investing activities totaled 1065
million compared to 2630 million in 2000 the company was less acquisitive in
2001 versus 2000 as its major focus was the spinoff of certegy capital
expenditures exclusive of acquisitions and investments amounted to 471
million in 2001 compared to 719 million in 2000 total capital expenditures in
2002 are expected to approximate 50 million acquisitions and investments net
of cash acquired declined from 3468 million in 2000 to 687 million in 2001
largely due to the may 2000 cis acquisition cash proceeds generated from the
sale of businesses and other assets amounted to 124 million in 2001 and 1575
million in 2000 and are principally associated with the city directory sale in
2001 and the sales of our risk management and vehicle information businesses in
2000

     in 2001 cash used by financing activities totaled 3255 million compared
to 164 million of cash generated in 2000 in 2001 the company reduced its
longterm debt 2989 million through the repayment of borrowings under its
revolving credit facility debt repayments were funded through operating cash
flows and the cash dividend received from certegy in conjunction with the
spinoff during the year the company acquired 215 million shares of stock at
an investment of 495 million stock repurchases in 2000 amounted to 65
million down from 2102 million in 1999 the repurchases were temporarily
suspended in 2000 to enable the company to apply available cash to the repayment
of debt incurred in connection with the cis acquisition at december 31 2001
the companys remaining authorization for share repurchases was approximately
45 million and in february 2002 the companys board of directors approved an
additional 250 million for share repurchases the company continued its 89year
history of paying dividends which totaled 323 million in 2001 dividends were
200 million lower than 2000 as the company reduced its quarterly dividend
after the certegy spinoff from 0093 to 002 per share

     at december 31 2001 3675 million was available to the company under its
new 465 million revolving credit facility should csc exercise its option to
sell its credit reporting business to the company note 10 additional sources
of financing would be required however management believes the company has
sufficiently broad access to the capital markets to enable it to arrange
alternative sources of financing alternative sources of funding available would
include the public debt markets and additional bank lines of credit

inflation

     we do not believe that the rate of inflation has had a material effect on
our operating results however inflation could adversely affect our future
operating results if it were to result in a substantial weakening in economic
conditions

critical accounting policies and estimates

   the companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions these estimates
and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

   the companys significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of
notes to consolidated financial statements management believes that the
following accounting policies involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant
specific description

valuation of longlived assets

   the company regularly evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred
which indicate that the carrying amounts of longlived assets principally
goodwill purchased data files systems development and other deferred costs
and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries may be impaired or not
recoverable the significant factors that are considered that could trigger an
impairment review include changes in business strategy market conditions or
the manner of use of an asset underperformance relative to historical or
expected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends in
evaluating an asset for possible impairment management estimates that assets
future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable if
it is determined that the asset is not recoverable the company measures the
impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its
remaining life while the company believes that its estimates of future cash
flows are reasonable different assumptions regarding such cash flows could
materially affect these evaluations in 2001 the fasb issued statement no 142
goodwill and other intangible assets which among other things eliminates the
amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets and requires that
goodwill be evaluated annually for impairment by applying a fair valuebased
test the company adopted the standard effective january 1 2002 for
acquisitions prior to june 30 2001 and in accordance with the standard will
complete its first fair valuebased impairment tests by june 30 2002

deferred tax assets

   the company estimates levels of future taxable income and utilizes prudent
and feasible tax planning strategies in establishing and maintaining deferred
tax assets see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements if the
company is unable to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the
future the companys effective tax rate could increase

              certain factors affecting forward looking statements

     the managements discussion and analysis and other portions of this form
10k include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private
securities litigation reform act of 1995 and the securities exchange act of
1934 these forwardlooking statements may include among others statements
concerning the companys outlook for 2002 volume and pricing trends cost
control measures and their results effective income tax rates the companys
expectations as to funding its capital expenditures and operations and other
statements relative to future plans and strategies these statements are based
on a number of assumptions that are inherently subject to significant
uncertainties many of which are beyond equifaxs control

     important factors that either individually or in the aggregate could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forwardlooking
statements include but are not limited to the following a change in the
growth rate of the economies within which the company conducts business
particularly in the us such that consumer spending and related consumer debt
are impacted a decline or change in the marketing techniques of credit card
issuers unexpected pricing pressures above and beyond the levels experienced in
the past us and international regulatory or legislative changes which may
adversely affect the businesses conducted by the company successful integration
of acquisitions risks associated with investments and operations in foreign
countries including regulatory environments exchange rate fluctuations and
local political social and economic factors successful development and
marketing of new products and services to existing and new industries
protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights
successful incorporation of technological change control and reduction of cost
and expense interest rate fluctuations changes in us and global financial
and equity markets including market disruptions and significant interest rate
fluctuations which may impede the companys access to or increase the cost of
external financing increased competitive pressures both domestically and
internationally and other risks or unforeseen factors including those described
below

we depend on our customers requirements for consumer credit information if
these requirements decrease our business might be adversely affected

our core product is our consumer credit reports in general the usage of credit
reports and related services is driven by consumer demand for credit via new
credit cards automobile loans home mortgages and refinancings and other
consumer loans and lenders efforts to develop new and monitor existing credit
relationships consumer demand for credit tends to increase during periods of
economic expansion on the other hand lenders efforts to monitor existing
credit relationships tend to increase during periods of economic contraction
consequently revenue from consumer credit information products is influenced by
cyclical economic trends related to consumer spending and debt

we rely on demand for consumer information services our business might be
negatively affected by a decline in demand

we provide valueadded consumer information services including direct marketing
products and services to our traditional customers as well as to catalog
publishing hightech travel and manufacturing clients direct marketing
products also include data capture database management and registration card
programs for consumer durable goods manufacturers in the event that consumers
begin to buy fewer of the types of products and services that have in the past
been marketed and sold through direct marketing or if direct marketing loses
effectiveness in comparison to other methods of advertising use of our direct
marketing products and services could lessen and consequently our revenues and
profits could decline

we rely on external data sources loss of access to credit and other data from
external sources could negatively impact our business

we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary
and nonproprietary databases including data received from customers and
various government and public record services the continued availability of
such data sources cannot be assured although we have no reason to believe that
access to current data sources will become restricted loss of access to or the
availability of data in the future due to government regulation or otherwise
could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and
results of operations

changes in government regulation could increase our costs or otherwise affect
our profits

our business involves collection of consumer and business data and distribution
of such information to businesses making credit and marketing decisions
consequently certain of our activities and services are subject to regulation
under various federal laws including the fair credit reporting act and the
grammleachbliley act as well as similar state laws we are also subject to
privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in foreign countries where we
do business

                                       14

page

we have no reason to believe that additional regulations will be imposed that
will have a material adverse effect on our business however further federal
state and local data use regulations may affect our operations with increased
compliance requirements and potential loss of revenue or decrease in profits

competition could hurt our business

equifax operates in a number of geographic product and service markets which
are highly competitive we primarily compete with two global consumer credit
reporting companies experian information solutions inc and trans union llc
which offer credit reporting products that are similar to those we offer we
also compete with these and other companies that offer marketing information
products and services including acxiom corporation and infousa inc

in each of our markets we compete on the basis of responsiveness to customer
needs as well as the quality and range of products and services offered
although we believe that we offer a broader range of products and services in
more geographic markets than our competitors we face strong competition in
certain geographic product and service markets which if successful may have
adverse effects on our operations

     the above factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of
forwardlooking statements are illustrative and by no means exhaustive all
forwardlooking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their
inherent uncertainty

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

the company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates

in the normal course of business the balance sheets and results of operations
of the companys foreign subsidiaries can be impacted by changes in foreign
currency exchange rates the companys position is to not hedge translational
foreign currency exchange risks however the company does hedge material
transactional foreign currency exchange risks and at december 31 2001 the
exchange risks associated with the companys intercompany advances to its uk
operations as well as the intercompany balances associated with funding its
italy acquisition were hedged by having a portion of the borrowings under its
revolving credit facility denominated in those respective currencies

the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by 1 maintaining
an appropriate weighted average debt maturity and 2 controlling the mix of
fixed and variable rate debt in part by using interest rate swap agreements
the companys earnings can be affected by the impact that changes in interest
rates have on its variablerate obligations at december 31 2001 approximately
358 million 47 of the companys shortterm and longterm debt was in
variablerate facilities at this level if market interest rates increased 1
interest expense would increase approximately 36 million per year pretax
